"Gout is characterized by intermittent painful flares of inflammatory arthritis in response to crystals formed in joints caused by excessive serum levels of urate. Gout is increasingly common, with a U.S. prevalence of approximately 4%. Factors contributing to this increase include dietary changes, increasing obesity, and an aging population. Nearly all patients with gout experience comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Some comorbidities (e.g., CKD) contribute to hyperuricemia; all comorbidities complicate treatment by posing relative contraindications for appropriate therapeutics (e.g., NSAIDs in patients with CKD)."

Untreated, most gout flares self-resolve within days to a few weeks, although with long-standing disease, flares can persist for months. In men with established disease, flares eventually affect the proximal feet, ankles, and knees, and later almost any joint, including the spine. Postmenopausal women may present differently, with initial flares often involving the knees, or finger joints affected by osteoarthritis. For patients with more severe or long-standing disease, polyarticular flares may occur. Soft tissues can also be involved, manifesting as acute bursitis (olecranon and prepatellar, most commonly), periarthritis, and gouty panniculitis and cellulitis, the last of which can be misdiagnosed as a refractory bacterial soft-tissue infection."

"CPPD primarily affects older patients, and prior joint trauma is a significant risk factor. The risk for cartilage calcification (chondrocalcinosis) doubles for every decade past 60 years, and nearly half of patients in their late 80s have CPP visible on plain radiographs. For younger patients with CPPD, laboratory evaluation for contributory metabolic disease (hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypophosphatasia, hypomagnesemia) is warranted."

"The pathophysiology of CPPD is incompletely understood. Pyrophosphate produced by chondrocytes likely precipitates with calcium to form CPP crystals, which then deposit and can activate inflammatory pathways, resulting in an acute arthritic flare. CPPD may also drive osteoarthritis by causing mechanical damage and inducing proinflammatory activity in chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that cartilage calcification might play a role in osteoarthritis of the knees and wrists, but not at the hip."

"Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout) typically presents as a monoarticular or oligoarticular inflammatory arthritis, characterized by sudden onset of swelling, pain, loss of function, tenderness, and warmth of the affected joint (usually a knee or wrist). Like acute gout, CPP flares may be provoked by systemic insults, such as major surgery or acute illness. Flares are usually milder than those of gout and less commonly affect the MTP joint, but if untreated they can persist for weeks or months. Definitive diagnosis requires identification of CPP crystals (along with leukocytes) in synovial fluid; in contrast to urate crystals, CPP crystals are rhomboid-shaped and positively birefringent (blue when parallel to and yellow when perpendicular to the polarizing axis of an optical filter). As in gout flares, joint infection may coexist with CPP arthritis, and synovial fluid Gram stain and culture are usually warranted. Radiographic evidence of cartilage calcification in older patients with acute monoarticular arthritis suggests, but is not diagnostic of, acute CPP crystal arthritis."
