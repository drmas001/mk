A key treatment goal is to treat to target, with the target being achievement of remission or low disease activity. Disease activity assessment involves making a measured determination using combinations of numbers of tender and swollen joints (typically by using 28 joints that exclude the feet); patient and physician impressions of disease activity; and, in some activity scoring systems, measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. These parameters are combined into a composite score, thus assigning a disease activity ranging from remission to low, moderate, or high. The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) are two commonly used instruments to assess disease activity and response to treatment.

"Methotrexate is the anchor drug in RA, used in both monotherapy and combination therapy. The target doses of methotrexate should be at least 15 mg weekly but can be titrated to doses as high as 25 mg per week in partial responders; the treating physician should generally maximize methotrexate dosing before adding other agents. At doses greater than 15 mg weekly, methotrexate oral absorption approaches its effective limit; a split dose of oral methotrexate over 24 hours or switching to subcutaneous administration allows for higher serum drug levels. Folic acid supplements minimize toxicity without diminishing efficacy. Of patients with RA taking methotrexate alone, 30% to 50% achieve remission or low disease activity."

"Leflunomide may be useful in patients who cannot tolerate methotrexate in both monotherapy and combination therapy. Hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are less potent agents and are rarely used as single agents since biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) became available. In patients with low disease activity, hydroxychloroquine monotherapy is conditionally recommended over other synthetic DMARDs. Both hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine can be used in combination with methotrexate as triple therapy. Data suggest that triple therapy is similar in efficacy to methotrexate combined with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, except in the area of radiographic progression. However, addition of a biologic DMARD or selected Janus kinase inhibitors to methotrexate is conditionally recommended over triple therapy for patients taking maximally tolerated doses of methotrexate that are not at target."

"Biologic DMARDs can be used as monotherapy but are typically added to methotrexate when moderate to high disease activity persists. TNF inhibitors are the most frequently used biologic DMARDs; they have a relatively rapid onset of action and demonstrate synergy with methotrexate. The combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor slows the rate of radiographic damage to cartilage and bone, even in the setting of continued clinical disease activity. This effect also has been shown with other biologics in combination with methotrexate. Other biologic DMARDs used in RA include abatacept (a selective T-cell costimulation modulator), tocilizumab (an anti–interleukin-6 receptor antibody), and rituximab (an anti–B-cell antibody)."
