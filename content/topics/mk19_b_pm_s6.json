"Anticoagulation and consideration of thromboendarterectomy are indicated for CTEPH. Lifelong anticoagulant therapy is indicated in all patients to help prevent further thromboembolism. The only potentially curative therapy for CTEPH is pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Because the disease is usually progressive, surgical evaluation at an experienced center is warranted in all patients with CTEPH regardless of disease severity. About half of patients with CTEPH will be eligible for surgery. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy can result in the normalization of pulmonary hemodynamics in about one-third of patients who undergo surgery. In patients who are deemed inoperable by one expert center, referral for a second opinion is recommended by guidelines. In inoperable patients and those who have persistent PH after thromboendarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty or medical therapy should be considered. Riociguat, a pulmonary vasodilator that acts on the nitric oxide pathway, is currently the only approved PH therapy available for CTEPH treatment. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty has recently emerged as an alternative option in nonoperable patients and those with persistent PH after thromboendarterectomy. Study results have been promising as patients show improved overall outcomes including PA hemodynamics, RV function, and symptoms. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty is not recommended as an alternative to thromboendarterectomy, given insufficient data to suggest equivalent outcomes between the two procedures."

Group 2 PH is often determined on the basis of abnormalities identified on echocardiography and a hemodynamic profile consistent with elevated left atrial pressure (measured by PA wedge pressure on right heart catheterization) greater than 15 mm Hg. The hemodynamic profile of patients with group 3 PH mirrors that of patients with PAH and CTEPH. Patient history of advanced lung disease in addition to abnormal chest imaging (radiograph or CT scan) or pulmonary function testing is essential to identifying group 3 disease. Significant abnormalities on imaging or pulmonary function testing should prompt further attention toward treatment of the underlying lung disease, not the PH. Chronic nocturnal hypoxia associated with sleep-disordered breathing is also associated with PH. Studies show that the prevalence of nocturnal hypoxia in patients with PH is as high as 89%. Common screening studies such as the Epworth sleepiness scale do not offer reliable sensitivity to exclude sleep-disordered breathing in this population. Current guidelines suggest considering an evaluation for sleep-disordered breathing or nocturnal hypoxia with polysomnography or home sleep study in patients with PH."
