All other noninvasive disease is treated with TURBT followed by either intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin or intravesical chemotherapy. After primary treatment, cystoscopic surveillance is indicated because of the risk for recurrent disease. There is a higher risk for muscle invasive recurrence for patients with larger tumors, less differentiated tumors, tumors that invade into the lamina propria, and tumors with multifocal or noninvasive recurrence. Most patients require cystoscopy 3 months after initial therapy, with subsequent cystoscopy at periodic intervals based on risk of recurrence. Cystectomy can be considered for patients at high risk for developing muscle-invasive disease."

"If muscle-invasive disease is diagnosed, imaging studies are indicated for staging. Cystectomy is indicated, with or without neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Partial cystectomy can be considered in very carefully selected patients. For patients unable or unwilling to undergo cystectomy, maximal TURBT can be combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for those with limited disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection is appropriate to consider in patients with high-risk features, such as positive nodes and extension beyond the bladder."
