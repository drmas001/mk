Cytokine generation supports autoreactivity, with type 1 interferons playing a major role.

"Disease activity markers, including complements C3 and C4, should be assessed initially and regularly thereafter. Complement levels are typically reduced during SLE activity, reflecting immune complex formation and complement consumption. Rising titers of anti–double-stranded DNA antibody levels may be concordant with SLE kidney disease activity. Other SLE autoantibodies, including ANA, do not reflect disease activity and need not be repeated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are variably associated with disease activity; some patients with SLE have little to no elevation in C-reactive protein during SLE flares, which may help distinguish flares from infection once the individual patient's pattern of responsiveness is established."

Almost all patients with SLE without contraindications should receive hydroxychloroquine. With very rare exceptions the dosage should be limited to 5 mg/kg/d or less, and patients should receive annual monitoring by an ophthalmologist after 5 years of treatment to reduce the risk for retinal toxicity.

For life- or organ-threatening disease (such as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or seizures), high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids are given, typically followed by daily oral glucocorticoids. After disease stability is achieved, glucocorticoids are tapered to the lowest effective dosage, preferably to no more than 7.5 mg/d within 4 to 6 months.

Mycophenolate mofetil is the preferred oral agent for lupus nephritis and is as effective as cyclophosphamide for induction therapy.
