"First-line treatment for an initial mild or severe C. difficile infection is oral fidaxomicin (preferred) or oral vancomycin. Fulminant disease is defined by the presence of shock, hypotension, toxic megacolon, or ileus. Treatment includes oral vancomycin, IV metronidazole, and possibly vancomycin enemas. A first recurrence is treated with oral fidaxomicin, standard vancomycin therapy, or vancomycin pulse/slow taper regimen. Bezlotoxumab is recommended with standard antibiotic treatment in adults that have a recurrence within 6 months of a previous episode (initial or subsequent recurrences). For second and subsequent recurrences, treatment options include extended therapy with fidaxomicin, pulsed and tapered oral vancomycin, vancomycin followed by rifaximin, and fecal microbiota transplantation."
