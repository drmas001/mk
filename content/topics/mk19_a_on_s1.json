"Medical oncology is undergoing constant change and improvement. Among the most important advances of the past decade has been the incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors into the standard treatment of many malignancies. These agents, although not directly attacking the patient's cancer, deactivate checkpoints that would otherwise suppress the immune system, and so facilitate the patient's own immune surveillance efforts to destroy the cancer. Another major advance includes the expanded role of molecular profiling and precision therapeutics. Current techniques allow for genomic profiling of tumor tissue, either from fresh biopsies, from archived, paraffin-embedded specimens, or from blood-based tumor mutation profiling. With the knowledge of the mutational profile, oncologists can make more informed decisions in the selection and rejection of different therapeutic options and inclusion of so-called targeted therapies that are designed to inhibit a particular molecular mutation or aberration. However, many traditional aspects of oncology, including the use of histologic diagnosis and clinical staging, as well as extensive use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, remain central to current oncologic practice. The cancer care continuum is now recognized to include not only diagnosis and treatment but also supportive/palliative care, survivorship care, and end-of-life care."

"Careful clinical evaluation and staging, understanding and communicating realistic goals of care, and recognizing and promoting patient preferences remain central to the practice of oncology. Meaningful progress has been made in many types of cancer. However, most cancers, once metastasized, although treatable with substantial potential for improvements in overall survival and quality of life, are still incurable. Supportive management of adverse effects has also improved; however, the adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy remain problematic for many patients, and sensitivity to the risks versus benefits must be considered when discussing treatment options with patients. Burdensome increases in the cost of new oncology drugs has become a focus of concern. Some of these high-cost drugs are highly active and offer substantial benefits, whereas others result in survival advantages measured in months or even weeks that, although statistically significant, are of debatable clinical relevance. The impact of financial toxicity has become an important consideration in oncologic care."

When a cure is not realistically possible, goals such as lengthening survival, shrinking a tumor, controlling disease growth, palliation or preventing disease-related symptoms, and maintaining quality of life should be discussed. The potential benefits of treatment must be weighed and considered against their risks and toxicities. Patients with incurable cancer face choices of more aggressive therapy designed to prolong their life, associated with more unpleasant and potentially dangerous adverse effects. Similarly, more aggressive initial therapy may result in prolonged remission or disease-free survival but may not necessarily change overall survival.

This concept of financial toxicity goes beyond individual patients in affecting the overall health care economy.

The risks of treatment are higher and may outweigh the benefit in patients with poor performance status due to chronic medical comorbidities or those who have not been able to tolerate initial treatment attempts. For such patients or for those who have exhausted standard treatment options, supportive, comfort-oriented care may be most appropriate. Use of adequate analgesia, as well as involving supportive care specialists, is important throughout the continuum of care but particularly so in patients with pain or with symptoms from either disease or therapy.

Randomized trials are crucial in determining whether, for any given population of patients, neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy improves an important outcome, such as cure, or disease-free interval, without unacceptable toxicity.

"Balancing therapy efficacy and toxicityâin particular, the need for adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy or the desired aggressiveness of the primary chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical therapy for populations of patientsâhas traditionally been based on stage, pathology, and understanding the tumor's overall behavior. Currently available imaging and laboratory studies are somewhat limited in terms of their ability to identify which patients will be at risk for cancer recurrence after definitive surgery. Numerous tumor markers, gene panels, and other technologies are available, but few are definitive. The preferred assay would be predictive, meaning that it could identify the subset of patients at risk for recurrence who will benefit from an intervention such as adjuvant chemotherapy. An example of this is a commercially available 21-gene assay for breast cancer that identifies a patient population who is at risk for recurrence and will have that risk lowered by chemotherapy. Such predictive tools are highly useful because they provide actionable information in terms of who to treat and who not to treat. A similar multigene assay in colorectal cancer is prognostic in that it can quantitate a patient's risk of recurrence but fails to identify which patients will have their risk lowered by chemotherapy. Therefore, it does not provide information that is useful for decision making. Predictive tests are of high value in that they provide clear, actionable information. Prognostic tests add no value in dictating therapy, as they do not provide actionable information."

This has become possible through the identification of immune checkpoints, which serve as âbrakesâ on the immune system in order to prevent the immune system from attacking itself and causing autoimmune diseases. Antibodies that block these checkpoints release the brakes on the immune system and allow it to aggressively attack the tumor. Adverse effects are related to resultant autoimmunity from the less-regulated immune system and can be severe. The first immune checkpoint identified was the antigen-4 (A-4) molecule on the surface of the cytotoxic lymphocyte (T cell), hence its designation cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4. Antibodies that block cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, such as ipilimumab, have been successful in mobilizing the immune system against melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and other malignancies. The other immune checkpoint that has been successfully exploited is the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. AntiâPD-1 agents, such as nivolumab or pembrolizumab, have shown substantial and durable activity against melanoma and nonâsmall cell lung cancers, as well as other tumors. Agents against the ligand of PD-1, PD-L1, such as atezolizumab or durvalumab, have also shown important clinical activity.
