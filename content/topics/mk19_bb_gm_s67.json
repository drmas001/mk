" is a DNA virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). It is characterized by the simultaneous onset of fever and a cutaneous eruption. Chickenpox lesions develop in crops, such that lesions in different stages of development (macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, crusted erosions) are present simultaneously on any one part of the body; lesions are most prominent on the trunk rather than the extremities."
