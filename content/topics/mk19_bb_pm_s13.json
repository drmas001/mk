"In high-risk populations, lung cancer screening results in a 20% lung cancer mortality reduction. Screen patients between the ages of 50 and 80 years (guidelines vary) who have a 20-pack-year history of smoking and who are currently smoking or have quit within the last 15 years. Continue annual low-dose CT imaging until comorbidity limits survival or the patient reaches the age of 80 years. Stop screening in patients who have stopped smoking for 15 years."
