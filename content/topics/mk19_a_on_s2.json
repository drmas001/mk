"Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in the United States, excluding skin cancers. In 2019, there were approximately 268,600 new invasive breast cancer cases and 48,100 in situ cases diagnosed. The lifetime risk of developing invasive breast cancer is 12.4% (about 1 in 8) for women in the United States. There were an estimated 40,610 deaths from breast cancer in the United States in 2017—the second leading cause of cancer death in women. The lifetime risk of dying from breast cancer for women in the United States is 2.76%. Breast cancer is rare in men."
