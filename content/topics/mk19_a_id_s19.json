The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has recently published updated guidelines for seasonal influenza evaluation and management, recommending PCR over rapid antigen tests. During seasonal influenza activity, testing for influenza should occur in patients at high risk who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness if the testing result will influence clinical management (decisions on antiviral treatment initiation, impact on other diagnostic testing, antibiotic treatment decisions, and infection control practices). Other outpatient candidates for testing include those who present with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and either exacerbation of chronic medical conditions or with known complications of influenza, such as pneumonia, if the testing result will influence clinical management. During times of influenza activity, testing for influenza at hospital admission is recommended for all patients with acute respiratory infection and in patients with acute worsening of chronic cardiopulmonary disease. In all cases, treatment decisions should not be delayed pending confirmatory results."

Three novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus (MERS-CoV), can infect animals and also cause severe disease and epidemics in humans. In 2002, SARS-CoV emerged in China, causing an acute pneumonia epidemic with a mortality rate of approximately 10%. No SARS-CoV infections have been reported since 2004. MERS-CoV emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia in humans and camels, with most infections occurring in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV causes pneumonia, diarrhea, and kidney failure with a mortality rate of approximately 40%. In December 2019, the third novel, deadly coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the city of Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to pandemic levels. Symptomatic disease is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, and loss of taste and smell; severe respiratory disease leading to death can occur, but most infections are mild or asymptomatic. Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 may persist following mild and severe infections. Because all types of coronaviruses may spread from human to human, contact and respiratory precautions should be implemented for hospitalized patients with suspected infection.
