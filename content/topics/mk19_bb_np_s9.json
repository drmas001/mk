"Usually the source of hypomagnesemia is obvious. If no cause is clinically apparent, GI and kidney losses can be differentiated by measuring the 24-hour urine magnesium excretion (elevated in kidney losses, low in GI losses). Hypomagnesemia is often associated with hypokalemia because of urine potassium wasting. Hypomagnesemia is also associated with hypocalcemia because of lower ",

After treatment with isotonic saline plus potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate, the bicarbonate concentration is 22 mEq/L. However, the serum potassium level is still 2.9 mEq/L, and the serum calcium level is 5.3 mg/dL."
