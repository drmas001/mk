"Normal swallowing consists of three phases. The oral phase encompasses formation of a food bolus and transfer of the bolus to the back of the throat. The pharyngeal phase allows the bolus to be safely positioned in the upper throat; the soft palate elevates, the epiglottis protects the trachea, the tongue moves backward, and the pharyngeal wall moves forward. The esophageal phase starts with the bolus entering the esophagus with relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter. Peristalsis (rhythmic contractions) propels the bolus down; primary peristalsis is initiated with the swallow, and secondary peristalsis is intended to clear residual bolus. This phase ends as the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes to allow the bolus to enter the stomach."

Protective mechanisms to minimize esophageal exposure to acid and its effects include swallowed salivary bicarbonate, peristalsis, a competent lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and gastric emptying; reflux occurs when these physiologic protectors become ineffective. Uncontrolled GERD can negatively affect quality of life because of poor sleep, low productivity, and work absences. Long-standing GERD can lead to complications, including reflux esophagitis, stricture, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Commonly attributed extraesophageal conditions include chronic cough, hoarseness (laryngitis), wheezing (asthma), and dental erosions. Pregnant women may experience GERD during any trimester of pregnancy, symptoms may worsen as the pregnancy progresses, and symptoms typically resolve after delivery."

Pill-induced esophagitis has occurred with alendronate, quinidine, tetracycline, doxycycline, potassium chloride, ferrous sulfate, and mexiletine. Medications associated with stricture formation include alendronate, ferrous sulfate, NSAIDs, and potassium chloride. Pill-induced esophagitis can be diagnosed by history alone, but upper endoscopy should be performed for severe symptoms, persistent symptoms, or atypical symptoms (such as hematemesis or abdominal pain). Preventive strategies include drinking sufficient water with medications and remaining upright for 30 minutes after pill ingestion."

Patients have dysphagia with both solids and liquids along with nonacidic regurgitation of undigested food.
