Evidence shows that specialty palliative medicine improves overall quality of life, physical symptom burden, mood, and caregiver satisfaction with patient care in the setting of serious illness. Notably, a palliative medicine team does not replace the primary physician, hospitalist, or specialist; rather, the team acts as an extra layer of support, integrating key information from the referring physician into goal-concordant care plans and attending to symptoms that affect quality of life. It remains the responsibility of the primary physician to explore psychosocial distress, provide anticipatory guidance, and perform basic symptom management before or concurrent with referral to palliative medicine specialists."

"Dyspnea is a prominent and distressing symptom in patients with advanced illness. The initial goal of treatment is to address the underlying cause (e.g., pleural effusion, infection, anemia, COPD, heart failure) and treat hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≤90% breathing room air), if present, with supplemental oxygen. A trial of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy may be considered for patients who have significant dyspnea and hypoxemia despite standard supplemental oxygen. A trial of noninvasive ventilation therapy also may be offered to patients without contraindications who have significant dyspnea despite standard measures. Many patients with advanced illness have persistent dyspnea despite maximal medical management, and opioids, most commonly morphine, are the treatment of choice in these patients. Opioids reduce the sensation of dyspnea and do not cause respiratory depression or hasten death when appropriately selected and dosed. Patients with dyspnea-related anxiety who continue to have dyspnea despite opioid therapy may benefit from short-acting benzodiazepines. There is mixed evidence regarding the benefit of nonpharmacologic interventions in relieving dyspnea. Mindfulness practices, relaxation, acupuncture, or chest wall vibration may be reasonable in selected patients. Patients with a life expectancy of days who continue to have refractory dyspnea despite all standard and palliative treatment options should be offered continuous palliative sedation. See ",

These secretions are thought to rarely affect respiratory status or cause patient discomfort, although the actual effect on the patient is unknown. Educating family members on the dying process can ease concerns. Treatment is often initiated in anticipation of or response to family distress. Measures such as repositioning the patient and withdrawal of parenteral hydration may be helpful. Compared with placebo, prophylactic subcutaneous scopolamine butylbromide reduces the occurrence of death rattle without clear evidence of an increase in adverse effects, but may prolong the dying phase by a few hours. Deep suctioning by catheter should be avoided unless secretions are causing obvious respiratory distress. Nonpharmacologic interventions, such as raising the head of the bed or positioning the patient on his or her side, may be helpful."
