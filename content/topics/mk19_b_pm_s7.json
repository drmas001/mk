"The mediastinum is anatomically near the center of the thoracic cavity and is bound by the sternum anteriorly, the lungs and pleura laterally, and the vertebral column posteriorly. Tumors in the mediastinum can be either benign or malignant, and symptoms vary depending on size (mass effect) and systemic effects of the tumor. Dividing the mediastinum into compartments can be useful in developing a differential diagnosis when a mediastinal mass is discovered ",

"The anterior mediastinal compartment lies between the posterior sternum and the great vessels and heart. It is the most common mediastinal location where malignant tumors occur. Masses in this location are usually remembered as the “terrible T's”: thymoma, teratoma/germ cell tumor, “terrible” lymphoma, and thyroid. Thymic lesions are the most common and are associated with various paraneoplastic syndromes such as pure red cell aplasia and myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that commonly presents with muscular weakness, fatigability, ptosis, diplopia, and bulbar symptoms. Diagnosis can be confirmed with an acetylcholine receptor antibody test."
