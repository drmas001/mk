HIV-associated arthritis is a nondestructive arthritis that involves joints of the lower extremity in an oligoarticular pattern and usually lasts less than 6 weeks. Reactive arthritis is the primary form of spondyloarthritis seen in patients with HIV infection and is more likely due to a response to other sexually transmitted or enteric infections than to the HIV infection itself. Reactive arthritis in HIV may take a chronic relapsing course and may be accompanied by enthesopathy and mucocutaneous manifestations. Psoriatic arthritis may be more common and is often more severe in patients with HIV infection, with disabling enthesitis and joint erosion as well as axial involvement (including sacroiliitis).

Ultrasound guidance may improve the ability to fully drain the joint. Surgical drainage is an equally good alternative and is more immediately definitive. Additionally, surgical drainage is required for joints that are not easily accessible for needle aspiration (e.g., sternoclavicular, sternomanubrial, shoulder, and hip joints), if there is evidence of soft-tissue extension of infection, or if the clinical response to antimicrobial therapy is inadequate. The goal of surgery is to remove all purulent material and nonviable tissue and, in some cases, to perform synovial biopsy or synovectomy."

Treatment beyond 1 month of ceftriaxone offers no benefit and should not be used. Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis occurs in 10% of patients or less, probably represents a progression to sterile autoimmune arthritis, and responds to synovectomy or treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (such as hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate)."
