"The primary treatment goals in HFpEF are to treat the underlying cause (hypertension, AF), to manage potentially exacerbating factors (e.g., tachycardia), and to optimize diastolic filling (control HR and avoid decreased effective circulating blood volume). Diuretics should be used when volume overload is present. Empagliflozin has been shown to reduce the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF in patients with HFpEF, regardless of the presence of diabetes."
