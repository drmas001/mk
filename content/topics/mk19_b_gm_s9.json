Virus transmission is via inhalation or direct contact with secretions infected with viral particles. Hand hygiene through frequent washing or use of alcohol-based rubs is an effective means of preventing transmission. Treatment goals are focused on reducing the severity of discomfort caused by frequent coughing, sneezing, and subjective malaise. Antibiotic therapy is ineffective and is not recommended for either shortening duration of symptoms or preventing bacterial superinfection. Medical therapy should be directed by symptoms. Analgesics may help with myalgia and headache, whereas nasal symptoms may respond to intranasal cromolyn, intranasal ipratropium, or combination decongestant/antihistamines.

Patients with viral pharyngitis should be treated conservatively with symptom control (such as analgesics [NSAIDs or acetaminophen], lozenges or topical sprays, and increased environmental humidity). In bacterial pharyngitis, appropriate antibiotic treatment reduces the risk for rheumatic fever, suppurative complications (such as peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess), duration of symptoms, and transmission. The Centor criteria (fever by history, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough) can help guide the need for testing and treatment of bacterial pharyngitis. Because the Centor criteria have a low positive predictive value for determining the presence of group A streptococcal infection, the best strategy may be to use the criteria to identify patients who have a low probability of infection. The Infectious Diseases Society of American suggests that patients with fewer than 3 Centor criteria do not need to be tested. Patients with a Centor score of 1 or less do not need to be tested; patients with two criteria can be considered for testing. Patients with three or more Centor criteria should be tested by using a rapid antigen detection test. Antibiotic treatment is reserved for patients with positive test results; penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line therapies. Throat culture should be considered in patients who are at high risk for complications (immunocompromised state) in the setting of high clinical suspicion but negative results on rapid antigen detection testing."

"; less common causes include viral infection (mumps, cytomegalovirus, HIV), mycobacterial infection, and recent radiation therapy. Conditions that decrease salivary flow increase the risk for sialadenitis; these include volume depletion, Sjögren syndrome, poor oral hygiene, sialolithiasis, malnourishment, prior radiation therapy, and use of anticholinergic medications. Physical examination often reveals tenderness and erythema over the affected gland. The parotid gland can be palpated from the earlobe forward to the gumline of the second upper molar, where the Stensen duct opens. The Wharton duct, the opening of the submandibular gland, can be felt along the floor or the mouth when palpating from posterior to anterior. Stones may be palpated and are typically tender, small, and hard, whereas tumors are typically firm and nontender. Manual palpation may result in pus exuding from the duct's orifice, whereas a healthy gland exudes clear saliva. Purulent drainage can be cultured to direct antibiotic therapy. An obstructed duct, however, will excrete no fluid on palpation. Management of sialadenitis and sialolithiasis includes stimulation of saliva production with warm compresses and sialagogues (sour candies or vitamin C lozenges); salivary gland massage; increased fluid intake; oral hygiene; and, in cases of bacterial sialadenitis, antibiotics. Recurrent sialolithiasis can result in chronic sialadenitis, and chronic obstruction can lead to salivary gland atrophy."
