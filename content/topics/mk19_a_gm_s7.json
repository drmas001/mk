Such treatment reduces or relieves symptoms, improves physical function, and improves the patient's satisfaction with treatment. Dermatologic side effects do not differ significantly between any topical intervention and placebo. Oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen are recommended as second-line therapies; they have proven ability to improve pain and function (but not patient satisfaction) and are associated with side effects, primarily gastrointestinal. Acupressure and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation also are recommended to reduce pain and improve function, on the basis of weaker evidence of efficacy. The American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend against the use of opioids, including tramadol, in the treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain."

The initial step in evaluating atraumatic shoulder pain is to determine whether the pain arises from the shoulder (intrinsic) or is referred from another site (extrinsic), such as the cervical spine. Extrinsic pain is suggested by the inability to reproduce pain with shoulder movement, pain extending beyond the elbow, and pain with neck movement."

"Anterolateral shoulder pain is the most common shoulder pain and may be caused by impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinopathy, adhesive capsulitis, or labral tears. Biceps tendinitis of the long head results in anterior shoulder pain that is aggravated by lifting and carrying. Posterior shoulder pain may result from tendinopathy of the external rotators of the rotator cuff or may be referred pain from the spine. Acromioclavicular pathology should be suspected when pain is localized to the end of the clavicle. Glenohumeral joint pathology should be considered when examination results are equivocal and pain occurs with movement in any direction. Plain film radiographs should be obtained in patients with recent trauma and those with loss of range of motion."

Pain from rotator cuff disease is frequently localized to the upper arm near the deltoid insertion, is worsened with overhead activities, and is often worse when lying on the affected side. A rotator cuff tear should be suspected when the pain is complicated by weakness in external rotation or abduction.

Low-risk fractures are treated with rest, crutches, a walking boot, and/or footwear padding to achieve pain-free ambulation. Follow-up radiography 4 weeks after the injury can help document healing. Once the patient can ambulate without pain and has no pain on examination with provocative maneuvers, nonimpact activity can be resumed gradually. Most patients with low-risk injuries can resume running in 8 to 12 weeks; resumption of running in patients with high-risk injuries should be individualized."

Pain usually improves with further walking but may persist in severe cases. On examination, the medial calcaneal tubercle is frequently tender. Passive toe dorsiflexion with standing may reproduce pain (sensitivity, 32%; specificity, 100%). Treatment includes weight loss, rest, calf/heel stretching, and arch supports (if pes planus is present). NSAIDs may be helpful for pain control. Patients should be counseled that resolution can be expected but may take months. For recalcitrant cases, ultrasonography, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, night splints, and glucocorticoid injections can be considered. Surgery is reserved for patients who do not respond to these measures."
