A 1- or 2-week diary of the sleep-wake schedule is a simple tool that promotes self-realization of suboptimal sleep habits. A more objective assessment of sleep and wakefulness can be obtained with a wrist actigraph—a device that measures movement and ambient light during a period of 1 or 2 weeks.

For short trips (one to two days), remaining on origin time might be preferable, if feasible. For longer trips, adjusting to the destination time may alleviate jet lag. Ways to promote adjustment include avoidance of sleep deprivation and dehydration, as well as bright light therapy starting up to 3 days before travel with the intention of advancing the circadian phase.

Management should first include counseling that takes into consideration eliminating shift work via a change in work schedule. If this is not feasible, then education about symptom management should be pursued. Interventions to improve daytime sleep may include bright light avoidance in the morning, maintaining a structured sleep-wake pattern (even during nonwork weeks), and use of melatonin, which is of modest benefit in shifting the physiologic sleep cycle. Hypnotic medications are of varying effectiveness and pose the risk for carryover effects into the nighttime work period. Interventions to promote nighttime wakefulness include bright light treatment in the evening before the night shift, caffeinated beverages, wake-promoting stimulants such as modafinil (only if conservative measures have failed), and planned napping during work breaks."

Although this frequency-based measure does not incorporate every important OSA outcome (for example, oxyhemoglobin desaturations), the AHI is probably the best composite metric of disease severity. An AHI of 5 to 14 per hour indicates mild OSA, 15 to 30 per hour indicates moderate OSA, and more than 30 per hour indicates severe OSA.

Disordered breathing events are most prominent during rapid eye movement, a stage of sleep characterized by atonia of nearly all muscles with the exception of the extraocular muscles and respiratory diaphragm. The process is terminated with a brief awakening from sleep (microarousal), during which upper airway patency is restored and ventilation resumes, typically followed by resumption of sleep and repetition of the process throughout the nightly sleep period."

Overnight pulse oximetry is also poorly discriminative, but in those who are asymptomatic with a low pretest probability, normal overnight oximetry might support the decision to avoid further testing. In-laboratory polysomnography is the gold standard test for mission-critical workers, patients with complicated OSA, and patients with comorbid conditions such as heart failure, neuromuscular disease, and advanced pulmonary disease in which diagnostic and treatment algorithms are more complex. Home sleep apnea testing, which is less costly and less resource intensive than polysomnography, is increasingly employed. Home sleep apnea testing does not measure electroencephalographic sleep like polysomnography does, but using respiratory tools or noninvasive measurements of vascular tone, pulse oximetry, and an accelerometer to detect posture, it is highly sensitive in diagnosing OSA in those with a pretest likelihood of moderate to severe disease. Home sleep apnea testing is less reliable in those felt to have milder disease."

Unlike OSA, oxygen during sleep may be indicated for patients with CSA who have hypoxia during sleep, as well as for those who cannot use or tolerate continuous positive airway pressure."

Capnometry (measurement of either transcutaneous or end-tidal carbon dioxide levels) is increasingly used to confirm hypoventilation during sleep, although oxygenation criteria are also used to diagnose sleep-related hypoventilation syndromes. Sustained reductions in oxyhemoglobin saturation in the setting of a compatible medical condition signify a hypoventilation syndrome. Obstructive sleep apnea may or may not be an associated feature."
