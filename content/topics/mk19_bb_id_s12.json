"Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne rickettsial infection most prevalent in the southeastern and south central states. Look for a history of tick bite and recent travel to an endemic area; febrile illness in spring and summer months; and symptoms such as nausea, myalgia, dyspnea, cough, and headache. Also look for a macular rash starting on the ankles and wrists and often affecting the palms and soles of the feet; lesions spread centripetally and become petechial."
