The typical adult diet contains 5 mg of iron for every 1000 calories. Only 10% to 20% of oral iron is absorbed. In a normal physiologic state, iron absorption is about equal to iron loss.

Iron deficiency in adults rarely occurs secondary to decreased oral intake but is more commonly secondary to blood loss. For premenopausal women, this is typically secondary to menstrual blood loss, but for men or postmenopausal women, occult gastrointestinal blood loss should be suspected, and bidirectional endoscopy is recommended; it is especially important to rule out an occult colonic neoplasm.

A low serum iron level, elevated total iron-binding capacity, low transferrin saturation (less than 15%; iron/total iron-binding capacity × 100), and serum ferritin level less than 14 ng/mL (14 μg/L) confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency. This ferritin value is highly specific (99%) but has a low sensitivity (59%), resulting in potentially false-negative results and missed diagnosis of iron deficiency. To maximize sensitivity, the American Gastroenterological Society recommends a ferritin cut-off value of less than 45 ng/mL (45 μg/L) (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 92%). Although ferritin is an acute phase reactant that increases with inflammation, a ferritin level greater than 100 ng/mL (100 μg/L) virtually excludes iron deficiency.

"Iron deficiency is typically managed with oral iron salts. Oral ferrous sulfate is the least expensive preparation, with each 325-mg tablet containing 65 mg of elemental iron. Oral absorption can be increased with supplemental vitamin C; conversely, medications such as antacids and fiber can reduce absorption. Frequent dosing (two or three times daily) of oral iron can lead to increased hepcidin production, which actually reduces iron absorption. For this reason, a single daily or every-other-day dose of oral iron sulfate may be the best replacement dose. Although oral ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, and other oral iron salts are available, none has proven superior to ferrous sulfate in tolerability, efficacy, or cost. Delayed-release and slow-release preparations may be better tolerated, but they are more expensive and are associated with reduced iron absorption because they can bypass the intestinal sites where iron absorption occurs. Although oral iron is typically well tolerated, symptoms can include gastrointestinal upset, constipation, and abdominal pain. Iron replacement usually results in reticulocytosis within days. Hemoglobin levels typically increase by approximately 1 g per week. Oral iron replacement typically lasts 3 to 6 months after normalization of hemoglobin to replace iron stores."

Thalassemia is an inherited disorder caused by a mutation of the α or β gene that results in impaired production of the corresponding α or β chains and subsequent imbalance of α to β chain ratio. Unpaired α or β chains precipitate, resulting in impaired production of hemoglobin and destruction of erythrocyte precursors in the marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis). This manifests in variable degrees of anemia, extramedullary hematopoiesis, bone changes, impaired growth, and iron overload. In patients with thalassemia, iron overload–related heart failure and arrhythmias are the major causes of death. Baseline iron studies should be obtained, and serial measurements of serum ferritin can monitor iron stores, particularly if transfusion requirements increase. A hemoglobinopathy most commonly results from a mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to an altered sequence or structure of the β chain (Hgb S, Hgb C) and can be coinherited with thalassemia. The worldwide incidence of β-thalassemia is 1% to 5%; the incidence of α-thalassemia is even higher. Thalassemia is common in African and Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

"Anemia of kidney disease can be associated with fatigue, depression, dyspnea, and decreased exercise tolerance. Anemia is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality from heart disease and stroke in patients undergoing dialysis. Supplemental use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) can improve anemia in patients with kidney disease. Guidelines recommend that ESAs be withheld in patients with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis who have a hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dL (100 g/L). For patients with chronic kidney disease with a hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL (100 g/L), ESA treatment should be individualized based on symptoms, speed of hemoglobin decline, and transfusion needs. For patients undergoing dialysis, ESAs should be initiated for hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL (100 g/L). Hemoglobin concentrations should not exceed 11.5 g/dL (115 g/L) to avoid adverse effects, including worsening hypertension, volume overload, and thrombotic complications. Because of high iron requirements in patients taking ESAs, parenteral iron is typically used to maintain a serum ferritin level greater than 100 ng/mL (100 μg/L) with a transferrin saturation of at least 20%. Although more than 95% of patients respond to ESAs, insufficient response can result from iron deficiency, folate deficiency, aluminum toxicity, blood loss, or inflammation. Regular monitoring of iron and ferritin levels is necessary to ensure an appropriate erythropoietic response."

Painful events are associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD, and the number of painful events is inversely related to life expectancy. For these reasons, painful events should be recognized and treated immediately. Opioids are the preferred analgesic, except for meperidine, which can cause seizures. The pathophysiology of chronic pain is poorly understood, and it is more difficult to treat. Chronic pain is exacerbated by emotional stress, anxiety, insomnia, and depression and is perhaps best treated with a holistic approach emphasizing nonopioid options such as NSAIDs, relaxation techniques, massage, and biofeedback.

"Pulmonary complications are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD. ACS is a clinical diagnosis based on the constellation of fever (>38.6 °C [101.5 °F]), tachypnea, hypoxia, cough, shortness of breath, and new pulmonary infiltrate. ACS can be the result of infection, in situ thrombosis, thromboembolism, fat or bone marrow embolism, or a combination of these factors. Patients with ACS should receive empiric antibiotics (infection triggers are not uncommon) in addition to adequate hydration and supplemental oxygen as determined by pulse oximetry. Incentive spirometry should be encouraged and adequate analgesia provided. These patients also require erythrocyte transfusion, either with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) or as exchange transfusion. Pulmonary hypertension also occurs in up to 30% of patients with SCD and is associated with increased mortality. Patients typically present with worsening right heart failure. The appropriate management of pulmonary hypertension in SCD has not been determined. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including sildenafil, have been associated with increased painful crises."

Monthly transfusion begun after a stroke can reduce the incidence of subsequent stroke by 50% but carries the risk of iron overload necessitating iron chelation. Hydroxyurea may also help in stroke prevention. In addition to thrombotic stroke, patients with SCD can have moyamoya disease (irregular perforating vascular networks near occluded or stenotic vessels in the region corresponding to lenticulostriate and thalamoperforating arteries) predisposing to cerebral bleeding in the third and fourth decade of life. Adults with SCD have lower cognitive function than healthy adults, perhaps secondary to silent ischemia or chronic anemia. It is unclear whether such cognitive decline can be prevented."

Simple transfusions with PRBCs are used to increase oxygen delivery and should not be used for uncomplicated pain crises or to treat chronic anemia. Patients undergoing surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia should receive PRBC transfusion targeting a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (100 g/L) to avoid surgical complications. Monthly transfusions reduce stroke risk in those at risk based on cranial Doppler arterial velocity and reduce recurrent stroke risk. Exchange transfusion is often used in the treatment of acute stroke, complicated ACS, and acute retinal artery occlusion.
