"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is typically characterized by narrowing of the aortic bifurcation and arteries of the lower extremities, including the iliac, femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause. Risk factors for PAD include smoking (current or past), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, increasing age, and family history of atherosclerosis. PAD occurs at a later age in women than in men, and because women have a longer life span, the overall prevalence is higher in women. The incidence of PAD begins to increase at around age 40 years and rises to approximately 10% at age 70 years."

Thus, early recognition of PAD provides a unique opportunity to identify persons at increased cardiovascular risk and to modify risk factors. According to guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), obtaining a screening ankle-brachial index (ABI) to identify PAD is reasonable in asymptomatic persons with one of the following characteristics that signify increased risk: (1) age 65 years or older, (2) age 50 to 64 years with risk factors for atherosclerosis (e.g., smoking, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) or family history of PAD, (3) age younger than 50 years with diabetes and one additional risk factor for atherosclerosis, or (4) known atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (coronary, carotid, subclavian, renal, or mesenteric artery stenosis or abdominal aortic aneurysm). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support screening for lower extremity PAD with an ABI."

"Anticoagulation, typically with unfractionated heparin, should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Specialists with expertise in revascularization should be consulted, and diagnostic angiography should be performed immediately to define the anatomic level of occlusion. In addition to surgical and endovascular revascularization options, catheter-directed thrombolysis improves outcomes in patients with acute limb ischemia."
