Two instruments are available to aid in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia: one issued jointly by the American Pain Society (APS) and the FDA, called the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks (ACTTION)-APS Pain Taxonomy, and a 2016 revision of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria ",

"Extensive laboratory studies (e.g., antinuclear antibody [ANA] testing) should also not be performed unless other specific diagnoses are suspected. Positive ANA test results, particularly at low titers, are nonspecific and have a low positive predictive value. Positive findings on ANA screening tests are highly prevalent in both the general population and patients with fibromyalgia. In addition to ANA positivity driving unnecessary additional testing, patients with fibromyalgia and positive ANA results are often incorrectly diagnosed with a connective tissue disease and given inappropriate and potentially harmful therapy. For example, studies have shown that many patients with fibromyalgia with a positive ANA result are unnecessarily treated with high-dose glucocorticoids."

Multiple rheumatologic conditions (Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) are also associated with a higher risk for coexistent fibromyalgia than seen in the general population. In patients with autoimmune disease and comorbid fibromyalgia, it is crucial to recognize when comorbid fibromyalgia is the primary driver of musculoskeletal symptoms in order to avoid overtreatment with immunosuppressive agents."
