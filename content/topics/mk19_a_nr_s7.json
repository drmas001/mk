"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes inflammatory damage to the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Most of the overt clinical symptoms of MS occur as a direct consequence of functional interruption of critical axonal pathways by inflammatory lesions. Relapses or flares involve development of neurologic symptoms over the course of hours to days and often peak in severity over the course of days to weeks. This is typically followed by a period of remission lasting weeks to months. Remyelination and recruitment of other brain regions to functionally substitute for the damaged area may result in clinical improvement during times of remission."

Proper application of the diagnostic criteria can prevent unnecessary neurologic testing, referrals, and misdiagnoses. A standardized MRI brain protocol should be used for all diagnostic evaluations of potential MS. Spinal cord imaging also should be performed in patients with symptoms of myelitis, patients with insufficient features on a brain MRI to support the diagnosis, and patients older than 40 years with nonspecific brain MRI findings. Strict adherence to the McDonald criteria for MS-specific lesions is critical because many other disorders (migraine, head trauma, and cerebrovascular disease) also can cause brain (but not spinal) lesions on MRI.

Ancillary testing can show objective clinical evidence of a demyelinating lesion. Demyelinating lesions of the optic nerve can be electrophysiologically confirmed with visual evoked potentials. Optic coherence tomography, which uses near-infrared light to quantify the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and macula, also can confirm optic nerve damage in acute or previous optic neuritis. Conductance delay in brainstem auditory evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials can act as surrogate markers of demyelination in brainstem and spinal cord pathways. Despite the usefulness of such testing for determining anatomic localization, however, MRI is the only objective measure that fulfills the diagnostic criteria."

"Interferon beta (available as interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b) is an immunomodulatory cytokine treatment that shifts immune responses away from autoimmunity and increase the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Interferons beta-1a and beta-1b are available in multiple formulations and are administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection on schedules varying from every other day to twice monthly. They reduce relapse rates by approximately one-third compared with placebo and have positive effects on disability progression and MRI findings. Head-to-head studies show general equivalence of the formulations, although those requiring frequent injections have slightly higher efficacy in some studies. Interferon beta may exacerbate depression, and care should be taken when administering it to patients with a history of psychiatric disease."

Whereas fingolimod showed no benefit in a trial for primary progressive MS, siponimod also is approved for use in patients with secondary progressive MS with activity.

Despite this high efficacy, natalizumab is typically limited to use as a second-line agent because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a CNS demyelinating infection caused by reactivation of the JC virus.
