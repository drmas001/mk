" is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma that commonly presents as a focal supratentorial lesion. PCNSL most commonly affects immunocompromised patients but may occur in patients with intact immune systems. A brain biopsy specimen is usually required to make a diagnosis. Ocular involvement in the vitreous confirmed by vitreal biopsy obviates the need for brain biopsy."
