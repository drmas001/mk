"Most patients with rheumatologic disease have well-established and well-classified diagnoses. However, given the common underlying processes of autoimmunity and inflammation, it is not surprising that some patients have features of more than one rheumatologic disease simultaneously or sequentially (overlap syndromes). Other patients present with signs and symptoms that are autoimmune in nature (often including Raynaud phenomenon) but do not rise to the level of a specific rheumatologic condition; such patients have undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a specific variant of overlap syndrome that includes clinical manifestations meeting a dual or triple diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune myositis, and/or systemic sclerosis. MCTD is associated with positivity for anti–U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies."
