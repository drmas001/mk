"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder related to mutations in the genes that primarily encode sarcomeric proteins. It is characterized by increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness in the absence of loading conditions (e.g., hypertension) or other underlying causes. HCM affects approximately 1 in 500 persons and may be identified in all age groups, although in the United States, index cases typically present within the third to fourth decades of life."

"Heart failure symptoms are attributable to abnormal LV filling (diastolic dysfunction) and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Diastolic dysfunction is multifactorial, involving increased chamber stiffness, progressive fibrosis, and myocardial ischemia due to mismatch of coronary flow and LV mass. Dynamic LVOT obstruction, characterized by asymmetric LV hypertrophy with prominent interventricular septal thickening, is the classic form of HCM. Outflow tract obstruction in HCM is found on echocardiography in 30% of patients at rest and in an additional 40% of patients with provocation; 30% of patients have no obstruction. During ventricular systole, anterior motion of the mitral valve results in early to midsystolic obstruction of the LVOT and subsequent mitral regurgitation related to leaflet malcoaptation (“eject-obstruct-leak” triad). Patients with dynamic obstruction may develop dyspnea, presyncope, or syncope during periods of increased ventricular contractility (exercise) or with decreases in ventricular preload or afterload, all of which may worsen the degree of obstruction."

In athletes, LV cavity dilatation and normal diastolic filling on echocardiography favor normal physiologic changes, whereas unusual or asymmetric patterns of hypertrophy favor HCM.

Surgical myectomy is associated with a higher likelihood of complete symptom resolution, greater obstruction relief, and a lower rate of repeat procedures. Alcohol septal ablation carries a higher risk for atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation; this risk is higher in older patients. Decisions regarding therapy must be individualized. Septal myectomy is favored in young patients and in patients with associated cardiac disease requiring surgical treatment, whereas alcohol septal ablation may be more appropriate for patients with comorbid conditions and increased surgical risk.

Clues to the presence of constrictive pericarditis include pericardial calcification on chest radiography or CT, pericardial thickening on CT or CMR imaging, and a B-type natriuretic peptide level below 100 pg/mL (100 ng/L) (usually ≥400 pg/mL [400 ng/L] in RCM). A hallmark feature of constrictive pericarditis is ventricular interdependence, whereby total cardiac volume is limited by the rigid pericardium. With ventricular interdependence, increased filling of the right or left ventricle can occur only with reciprocal decreased filling of the other ventricle. Ventricular interdependence may be demonstrated by Doppler echocardiography, CMR imaging, or invasive hemodynamic evaluation in patients with constriction; however, it is not present in patients with RCM."

Patients with a myxoma may present with constitutional symptoms related to interleukin production, embolic phenomena from tumor fragmentation, or symptoms referable to intracardiac obstruction (dyspnea, syncope). When mitral valve obstruction is present, auscultatory findings are similar to those of mitral stenosis; however, findings may vary with position or be associated with an early diastolic sound, known as the tumor plop. Surgical removal is indicated to prevent embolic events, as is subsequent surveillance echocardiography for detection of recurrence."
