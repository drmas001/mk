"Paget disease is a focal disorder of bone remodeling that leads to greatly accelerated rates of bone turnover, disruption of the normal architecture of bone, and sometimes gross deformities of bone (enlargement of the skull, bowing of the femur or tibia). Most patients are asymptomatic, and the disease is suspected when an isolated elevation of alkaline phosphatase is detected in the absence of liver disease."
