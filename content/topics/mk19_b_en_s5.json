"The testes contain two anatomic units: the spermatogenic tubules composed of germ cells and Sertoli cells, and the interstitium containing Leydig cells.

FSH in turn stimulates Sertoli cell spermatogenesis; inhibin B produced by the Sertoli cells is an important inhibitor of pituitary FSH secretion. LH separately stimulates testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells in a diurnal pattern with some testosterone undergoing conversion to dihydrotestosterone and estradiol; LH secretion is regulated by negative feedback of testosterone and estradiol ",
