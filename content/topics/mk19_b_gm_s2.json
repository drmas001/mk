"Quality improvement (QI) refers to a systematic approach to analyzing practice performance with the aim of providing optimal evidence-based care in a reproducible and reliable manner while also improving patient safety. QI also aims to improve the health care process by reducing waste and unnecessary treatments while ensuring that all patients receive equitable care regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. The focus on practice performance data can be at the patient level (such as screening), the system level (such as hospital readmission rates), or the population level (such as regional mortality rates). The process of QI is ideally continuous, occurring in real time with rapid-cycle improvements and iterative change made by ongoing observations. Successful QI requires participation from all health care team members as well as patients."

"Physicians have the potential to both recognize and mitigate threats to patient safety. In addition, substantial variability in physician-delivered care and nonadherence to evidence-based guidelines may contribute to lack of quality care. Accordingly, QI interventions that are developed with physician input are much more likely to succeed than those developed without such consultation. Physicians also have the opportunity to improve patient safety in everyday clinical work by focusing on common domains of error, such as medications and transitions of care. Despite this, physicians participate in less than 35% of QI interventions. Common reasons for physicians not participating include lack of skills, inadequate time, financial disincentives, and perceived threats to autonomy."

However, it may require clinician time for making changes and combination pills may be more expensive. Consultation with a clinical pharmacist is a team-based approach that facilitates disease co-management, allowing physicians to utilize their time performing other tasks. This method may be costly and may not be available at all institutions.

However, cognitive behavioral therapy may not be available for all patients, requires a patient's time investment, and has associated costs for use of a specialist.

"The Model for Improvement is the most commonly used QI model in health care. It provides a simple framework for QI interventions that relies on rapid PDSA cycles. A key underlying theme is that although not every change leads to improvement, improvement cannot occur without change. This model works best when frontline health care staff members are active participants. Users of this model begin by developing a goal by asking, “What are we trying to accomplish?” Next, to determine how to track success, users must answer, “How will we measure if a change yields an improvement?” The final step in this model is to determine what change is going to be made by asking the question, “What change can we make that will result in improvement?” Because this QI model does not help to identify causes of health care problems, it works best for problems with easily identifiable causes and evidence-based solutions. For example, a medical center may set the specific goal of increasing adherence to stroke treatment guidelines and use PDSA cycles to rapidly implement and assess the impact of changes, such as using a computerized admission order set."

On average, most processes are only 5% value added and 95% non–value added. The Lean model is best applied to directly observed problems and when flow, efficiency, and speed are prioritized; involvement of frontline health care staff members is crucial because they are in the best position to identify problems. Value stream mapping is an example of the Lean model in which the steps of a process and time required for each step are graphically displayed, thereby highlighting process inefficiencies and allowing for their improvement. Using the Lean model, results can typically be seen within weeks."

Six Sigma is a five-phase process: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC). In the Define phase, key measures for determining success are established. In the Measure phase, past performance levels are determined to provide a baseline to measure future improvement. In the Analyze phase, causes of the current problems and improvement opportunities are identified. Finally, in the Control phase, improvement is standardized to maintain sustainability. Six Sigma typically requires a time commitment of at least several months and substantial institutional resources to implement effectively. As such, it is best applied to complex, multistep health care problems in which an immediate cause or solution cannot be readily identified, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections."

"As defined by AHRQ, health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the information required to make informed health decisions. Low health literacy is more common among older adults, minority populations, persons with lower socioeconomic status, and medically underserved groups. Low health literacy may hinder patients' ability to describe their health concerns, complete health forms accurately, understand medical information, and manage their health conditions. Furthermore, evidence shows that low health literacy is associated with poorer health outcomes and decreased utilization of care."
