"The most common causes include vascular disease, neurologic disease, medications, androgen deficiency, and psychologic issues. Along with medications (e.g., antidepressants, β-blockers), look for alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, opioid, or marijuana use. Psychogenic dysfunction is common and may coexist with other causes. Erectile dysfunction occurring with preserved ability to achieve nocturnal and early morning erections should raise suspicion for psychogenic cause."
