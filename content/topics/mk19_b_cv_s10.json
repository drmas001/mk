"Because the leading cause of death in patients with TAA is rupture, surveillance and treatment depend on aneurysm size and subsequent rupture risk. The average expansion rate of TAA is 0.1 cm/year but is influenced by patient-specific factors. Expansion rate increases with increasing diameter of the aneurysm and is faster during pregnancy, when involving the ascending aorta, and in patients with either Marfan syndrome or bicuspid aortic valve. Annual aneurysm imaging is recommended for patients with degenerative conditions of the aortic root or ascending aorta measuring 3.5 to 4.4 cm in diameter; imaging should be performed every 6 months if 4.5 to 5.4 cm in diameter. In patients with Marfan syndrome, repeat assessment should be done 6 months after diagnosis to determine the rate of aortic enlargement. Thereafter, imaging is recommended every year for aneurysms measuring 3.5 to 4.4 cm in diameter and every 6 months if 4.5 to 5.0 cm. In all patients, more frequent imaging is recommended if rapid expansion is documented (>0.5 cm/year) or the aneurysm is approaching the threshold for repair. Aneurysms smaller than 5.0 cm are most often imaged with transthoracic echocardiography, provided an adequate image can be obtained. Other imaging modalities include CT angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Echocardiography is obtained in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve."

Aortic repair should be performed in patients with AAA diameter of 5.5 cm or larger, rapid expansion in AAA size (>0.5 cm/year), or symptoms resulting from AAA (e.g., abdominal or back pain). In patients with an indication for aortic repair, the choice between open surgery and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is driven by the location of the AAA and involvement of the renal and mesenteric arteries. Suprarenal and juxtarenal aneurysms most often necessitate open surgical repair. Patient age, comorbid conditions, and ability to tolerate open surgical repair determine which procedure is performed in patients with an infrarenal AAA. EVAR is associated with lower short-term (30-day) morbidity and mortality but no significant differences in long-term mortality. Additionally, EVAR is associated with greater need for repeat intervention and significantly higher rates of endoleak, device failure, and postimplantation syndrome (fever, leukocytosis, elevated serum C-reactive protein level).
