A systematic review of 18 multiple-factor scoring systems, including the Ranson criteria and the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, for predicting outcome in acute pancreatitis found these systems to have limited clinical value and accuracy. Scoring systems identify severe disease only as it develops, without enough lead time for intervention, and they are too cumbersome for routine use. Elevated hematocrit, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels, and the presence of SIRS are as accurate as complex scoring systems in predicting outcome, and they are easier to use."

Some studies suggest that pancreas-protocol MRI may be superior to CT for pancreatic disease. Histopathologic confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is increasingly recommended before initiation of therapy. In patients with potentially resectable disease, endoscopic ultrasonography–guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy is recommended for histologic confirmation of cancer. It is preferable to CT-guided biopsy because of its higher diagnostic yield, safety, and lower risk for peritoneal seeding. Patients are considered for primary surgical resection if they have no involvement of mesenteric vasculature or metastatic disease and are healthy enough for major intra-abdominal surgery."

Differentiating mucinous cysts from serous cysts, pseudocysts, and cystic neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas can be challenging because there is no definitive test with high sensitivity and specificity. Endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration is used for cyst fluid analysis in worrisome lesions; cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen levels are frequently elevated in patients with mucinous cysts, whereas cyst amylase levels are often elevated in patients with pseudocysts.

Glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, adrenocorticotropic hormone, somatostatin, serotonin, and parathyroid hormone–related hormone levels may be measured as clinically indicated. Genetic testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is recommended in all young patients with gastrinomas or insulinomas and in any patient with a family or personal history of other endocrinopathies or multiple pancreatic NETs.
