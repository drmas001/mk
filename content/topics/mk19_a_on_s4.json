The mean age of diagnosis in the United States is 48 years. During the last 30 years, cervical cancer incidence and deaths in developed countries have decreased by more than 50%, primarily because of screening and preventive treatment. It remains the second most common cause of mortality from cancer in women worldwide. More than 85% of deaths are in less developed countries."

Squamous cell carcinoma is the histologic type in 69% of cervical cancers, with adenocarcinoma accounting for 25%.
