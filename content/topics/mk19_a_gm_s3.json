". In applying these principles, physicians must consider the specific clinical scenario, including cultural and patient-specific factors, to determine an appropriate course of action. At times, however, ethical principles may seem in conflict, leading to ethical dilemmas. For example, respecting the autonomy of a competent patient who is making poor decisions may seem to contradict the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. Ethical dilemma resolution can often be accomplished by (1) evaluating the medical situation; (2) framing the ethical question or dilemma and considering all available options; (3) considering the ethical principles underpinning the question; and (4) understanding the context, including the motivations of those involved. With this information, clinicians can balance the ethical principles and individual interests to determine the range of possible ethical actions. When ethical dilemmas are difficult to resolve, physicians may obtain assistance through an ethics consultation."

Professionalism in medicine is specifically characterized by the placement of the patient's interests above the physician's self-interests (the fiduciary relationship); acquisition, maintenance, and expansion of specialized medical knowledge; adherence to ethical principles; and self-regulation of members and responsibilities. The obligation of physicians to the welfare of their patients creates an ethical imperative to provide competent and compassionate care to all patients, regardless of their illness. Refusal to provide appropriate care to any group of patients for any reason, including infectivity or disease state, is unethical."

"Physicians' specialized knowledge creates a unique opportunity to intervene and benefit other citizens in emergency situations, and in this context, physicians may provide care outside of the clinical setting to persons who are not their patients. When physicians assist in these situations, patient consent to receive emergency treatment is usually presumed or implied. If the treatment is provided in good faith, Good Samaritan laws usually protect the physician from liability, except in cases of gross negligence. Providing medical care as a bystander is typically voluntary, with clinicians weighing their ethical obligations to provide assistance; however, state laws vary on this point, and several states have “failure to act” laws that are not specific to physicians."

Conflicts of interest exist in clinical care, philanthropic opportunities, and research. Physicians are obligated to recognize, disclose, and manage all conflicts of interest. Disclosure of conflicts, however, may not be an adequate safeguard against bias in decision making, and potential conflicts should be removed if possible."

Impairment may be caused by substance use, aging, or mental illness or other disease; however, the presence of such a disorder does not always signify impairment. Physicians have the responsibility to safeguard patients from impaired physicians and to assist impaired colleagues. A stepwise approach should be pursued, in which concerns are first discussed with the colleague if patient harm is unlikely, followed by report to clinical supervisors or the local or state medical society if patient harm is possible or imminent. If the appropriate action is unclear, physicians should seek advice from supervisors or designated officials. Physicians also should work collectively with institutions to develop methods for reporting, treating, and remediating impaired or disruptive colleagues. Impaired physicians should be allowed the opportunity to rehabilitate through a physician health program whenever possible."

"Physician burnout is a response to chronic unresolvable occupational stress. Burnout includes features of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced sense of professionalism and may lead to classic depressive symptoms. Common drivers of burnout include a high workload with substantial administrative work, lack of autonomy, poor work-life balance, and inefficient EHRs. Moral distress may exacerbate or lead to burnout. Moral distress occurs in situations in which physicians are unable to carry out what they believe to be ethically appropriate actions and feel their integrity is jeopardized. Moral distress is associated with a noncollaborative working environment and lack of empowerment or autonomy at work."

Although research on burnout is ongoing, early studies have found that burnout is associated with shorter life expectancy, substance use, and broken relationships. Physicians experiencing depersonalization are more likely to be involved in patient safety incidents and to receive low satisfaction ratings from patients. Early-career physicians and medical trainees with burnout and low professional efficacy are more likely to deliver suboptimal care."
