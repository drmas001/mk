"Reed–Sternberg cells are large and either are multinucleated or have a bilobed nucleus (“owl's eye” appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli. They can be seen with light microscopy in biopsies from individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma. They are usually derived from B lymphocytes. When seen against a sea of B cells, they give the tissue a “starry sky” or “moth-eaten” appearance. The absence of Reed–Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value for Hodgkin disease."
