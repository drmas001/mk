"ECG demonstrating significant prolongation of the QT interval as well as abnormal morphology, which is best seen in the early precordial leads. Of note, when the heart rate is less than 60/min, the absolute QT interval is routinely used instead of the corrected QT interval (QTc) for heart rate. A QT or QTc greater than 500 ms is a risk factor for adverse events."
