"The “waterfall” model of hemostasis is useful for teasing out coagulation disorders affecting the PT and the aPTT. In this model, factors common to the PT and the aPTT are X, V, II, and fibrinogen. Factor VII is unique to the PT, and factors XII, XI, VIII, and IX are unique to the aPTT. aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time; PT = prothrombin time."
