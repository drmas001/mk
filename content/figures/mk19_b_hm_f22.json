"Algorithm regarding the diagnosis and treatment of HH. Step 1: In patients with suspected HH based on symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, or family history, the suggested initial screening tests should be TS and SF level. Step 2: If TS <45% and SF is normal, further evaluation is unnecessary. If TS ≥45% and SF is elevated, HFE gene testing should be performed. Step 3: All patients homozygous for C282Y should proceed to phlebotomy. If SF >1000 ng/mL (1000 μg/L), liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging. Screen for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. Liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. In the patient who is not C282Y homozygous, other causes of elevated iron indices should be evaluated, including liver and hematologic disorders. If other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, HIC should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI. Patients with elevated HIC and SF >1000 ng/mL (1000 μg/L) should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy. ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; HH = hereditary hemochromatosis; HIC = hepatic iron concentration; SF = serum ferritin; TS = transferrin saturation."
