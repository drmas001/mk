This transmembrane transport in the enterocyte and hepatic cells is downregulated by hepcidin, a hormone produced by hepatocytes in response to increased iron stores and inflammation."

Step 3: All patients homozygous for C282Y should proceed to phlebotomy. If SF >1000 ng/mL (1000 μg/L), liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging. Screen for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. Liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. In the patient who is not C282Y homozygous, other causes of elevated iron indices should be evaluated, including liver and hematologic disorders. If other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, HIC should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI. Patients with elevated HIC and SF >1000 ng/mL (1000 μg/L) should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.

"The cell-based model of hemostasis is useful for understanding coagulation as it occurs in vivo. The initiation of coagulation takes place on the surface of a tissue factor–bearing cell, such as a macrophage, a tumor cell, or an activated endothelial cell. TF and a small amount of factor VIIa generate factor Xa, which joins with factor Va to form a small amount of thrombin (factor II). Excess thrombin generation is avoided through the antagonistic role of TFPI. In the priming step, this small amount of thrombin proceeds to activate platelets and factor VIII, which joins with factor IX to generate factor Xa. On the platelet surface, the prothrombinase complex can generate a large thrombin burst in the propagation step, allowing for cleavage of fibrinogen into fibrin. TF= tissue factor; TFPI = tissue factor pathway inhibitor."
