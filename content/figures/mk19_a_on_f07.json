"Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common lymphoma to involve the mediastinum, shown in this chest radiograph (left) as a mass that originates from the mediastinum, given the convex angles resulting from the mass impinging on the pleura. The lateral film (right) localizes the mass to the anterior mediastinum. Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common cause of anterior mediastinal masses in patients aged 20 to 30 years."
