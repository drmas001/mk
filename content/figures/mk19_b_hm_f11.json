"). This process is facilitated by the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) protein on the gut and the ferroportin on the vessel surface. Iron entering the vascular space is rapidly bound by transferrin and mostly transported to erythrocytes where it is incorporated as hemoglobin. Excess iron is stored in the liver in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells utilizing transferrin receptors and ferroportin to transport it across the membrane. This transmembrane transport in the enterocyte and hepatic cells is downregulated by hepcidin, a hormone produced by hepatocytes in response to increased iron stores and inflammation."
