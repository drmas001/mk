"The inflammatory cascade in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells present inciting antigens to T cells. Macrophages secrete multiple cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, which are also secreted by activated synovial fibroblasts. The activated fibroblasts secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other enzymes that contribute to the degradation of articular cartilage and activate neutrophils, which mediate joint damage through proteases and other enzymes. Activated osteoclasts additionally secrete MMPs that contribute to marginal erosions of bone. ILs, TNF, T cells, and B cells may all be targeted for inhibition by the various disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs useful in RA. CCP = cyclic citrullinated peptide; IL = interleukin; LTB",
