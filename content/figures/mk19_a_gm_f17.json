"The FABER (Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation) test. With the patient supine, the leg on the tested side is placed in the “figure 4” position (the knee of the tested side is flexed 90 degrees, and the lateral malleolus is placed on top of the opposite leg). The examiner then applies a posteriorly directed force with one hand while using the other hand to stabilize the patient's other hip. The result is positive if groin pain or buttock pain is produced. Buttock pain suggests sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and groin pain suggests an intra-articular cause."
