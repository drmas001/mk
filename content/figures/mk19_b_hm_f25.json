"The cell-based model of hemostasis is useful for understanding coagulation as it occurs in vivo. The initiation of coagulation takes place on the surface of a tissue factorâ€“bearing cell, such as a macrophage, a tumor cell, or an activated endothelial cell. TF and a small amount of factor VIIa generate factor Xa, which joins with factor Va to form a small amount of thrombin (factor II). Excess thrombin generation is avoided through the antagonistic role of TFPI. In the priming step, this small amount of thrombin proceeds to activate platelets and factor VIII, which joins with factor IX to generate factor Xa. On the platelet surface, the prothrombinase complex can generate a large thrombin burst in the propagation step, allowing for cleavage of fibrinogen into fibrin. TF= tissue factor; TFPI = tissue factor pathway inhibitor."
