"Spurling test for cervical nerve root compression. With the patient in a sitting position, the examiner extends the patient's head and then laterally flexes the neck. Downward pressure is then applied to the head in this position. A positive result reproduces the patient's pain, which radiates into the ipsilateral arm in a dermatomal distribution and supports the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy (sensitivity, 30%; specificity, 94%)."
