"Treatment algorithm for guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including novel therapies. Green identifies a class 1 therapy from clinical practice guidelines, whereas yellow indicates a class 2 therapy. Although current guidelines support the use of isosorbide dinitrate–hydralazine in Black patients, making management decisions on the basis of skin color is likely a flawed approach. Questions regarding the underlying studies and the appropriateness of using race to direct management are driving a reevaluation of these recommendations. ACEI = ACE inhibitor; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; ARNI = angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; HR = heart rate; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SGLT2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2."
