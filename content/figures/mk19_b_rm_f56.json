"Palpable purpura is the classic rash of any small-vessel, immune complexâ€“mediated vasculitis. The lesions are nonblanching and represent extravasations of blood from damaged vessels. Purpuric lesions are typically more prominent on the lower extremities, a consequence of the superimposed effect of gravity on hydrostatic pressure."
