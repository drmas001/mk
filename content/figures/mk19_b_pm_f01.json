"A simplified algorithm such as this may be used to assess lung function in clinical practice. It presents classic patterns for various pulmonary disorders. As in any such diagram, patients may or may not present with the classic patterns, depending on their illnesses, severity, and lung function before disease onset (for example, did they start with a vital capacity [VC] close to the upper or lower limit of normal [LLN]?). The decisions about how far to follow this diagram are clinical and will vary depending on the questions being asked and the clinical information available at the time of testing. The FEV",
