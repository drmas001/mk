"The typical physical findings of dyshidrotic eczema are multiple small vesicles on the palmar or plantar skin, especially along the lateral aspects of the fingers and toes. The diagnosis is supported by a history of recurrent episodes of intense pruritus on the palms and/or soles, followed by the development of multiple small vesicles. The vesicles will desquamate, leaving erosions and fissures."
