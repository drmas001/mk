"Polymorphous light eruption may take the form of any light-induced, pruritic eruption, particularly after intense light exposure. It is diagnosed only after other light-induced eruptions (systemic lupus erythematosus, photodrug reaction, and porphyria cutanea tarda, among others) have been excluded. The most common variant of polymorphous light eruption is pruritic, pink to red papules or papules and vesicles as seen here; less common variants are plaques and urticaria."
