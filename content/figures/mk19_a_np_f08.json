"Hypokalemia is responsible for the changes on the ECG. The characteristic ECG finding in hypokalemia is the appearance of a U wave after the T wave, eventually replacing the T wave. Initially, T waves decrease in amplitude, and the ST segment flattens. Then U waves appear after the T waves, as seen in this image. The U waves ultimately replace the T waves completely; this may give the impression of QT prolongation, but it is a QU interval."
