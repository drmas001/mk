"A simplified algorithm presenting an initial approach to the treatment of both early and established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All patients with RA should receive a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug initially and be advanced to more aggressive and/or combination therapy as needed to control disease. Disease activity should be assessed, wherever possible, by using a formal, validated, and consistent disease activity index. Refer to the 2015 American College of Rheumatology RA treatment guidelines for more complex algorithms accounting for differences between agents and patient-specific complexities. DMARD = disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; MTX = methotrexate; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor."
