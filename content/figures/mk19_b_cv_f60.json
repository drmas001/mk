"A pulse volume recording demonstrating decreased perfusion in the patient's right side. An ankle-brachial index value of 0.70 on the right side is consistent with the diagnosis of mild to moderate peripheral artery disease (ankle-brachial index <0.90). The normal pulse volume recording on the patient's left side has a sharp systolic upstroke and downstroke (the width of the waveform is much narrower compared with the width of the waveform on the right side). When the amplitude of the waveform is significantly blunted and the width is broader, it suggests moderate to severe disease. BP = blood pressure; DP = dorsalis pedis; PT = posterior tibial."
