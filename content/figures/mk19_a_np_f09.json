"This ECG demonstrates tall, peaked T waves and decreased P waves, which are characteristic of hyperkalemia. In experimental models of increasing potassium, there are progressive changes in the ECG beginning with peaked T waves, PR prolongation, loss of P waves, widening of QRS, and finally sinusoidal waveform. This, however, is not necessarily true in clinical situations."
