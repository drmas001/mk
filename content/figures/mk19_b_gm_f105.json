"Seborrheic keratoses are brown, scaly, waxy papules or plaques that commonly occur in older persons. They frequently have a “stuck-on” appearance and often have verrucous (warty) surface changes as well. Seborrheic keratoses typically demonstrate horn cysts (epidermal cysts filled with keratin) on the surface that can best be visualized on dermoscopy."
