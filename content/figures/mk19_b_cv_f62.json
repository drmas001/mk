"Pretest probabilities of obstructive CAD in symptomatic patients according to age, sex, and symptoms. The pretest probability shown is for patients with anginal symptoms. Patients with lower-risk symptoms would be expected to have lower pretest probability. The darker green- and orange-shaded regions denote the groups in which noninvasive testing is most beneficial (pretest probability >15%). The light green–shaded regions denote the groups with pretest probability of CAD ≤15% in which the testing for diagnosis may be considered based on clinical judgment. If CAC is available, it can also be used to estimate the pretest probability based on CAC score. CAC = coronary artery calcium; CAD = coronary artery disease."
