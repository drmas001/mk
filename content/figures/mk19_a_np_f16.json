"Deposition diseases can be divided into five major categories: immunoglobulin (Ig)-related disease, AA amyloid, mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibrillary glomerulopathy, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy. Ig-related disease can be further divided into multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). Although some histopathological findings occur more commonly in either multiple myeloma (such as cast nephropathy) or MGRS, most have been reported in either disorder. C3 CN = C3 glomerulopathy (dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis)."
