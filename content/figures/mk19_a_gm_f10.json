"Straight leg raise test. With the patient lying supine on his or her back, the examiner lifts the patient's leg with the knee fully extended on the affected side (ipsilateral straight leg raise test) and then repeats on the opposite side (contralateral straight leg raise test). The result is considered positive when pain radiates down the leg past the level of the knee when the hip is flexed between 30 and 70 degrees."
