"At clinical onset, multiple sclerosis (MS) can be either relapsing or progressive in nature. An initial, isolated demyelinating event results in a preliminary diagnosis of a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Any further activity (defined as a clinical relapse, new or enlarging T2-weighted lesion on MRI, or gadolinium-enhancing lesion on MRI) results in a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Over time, RRMS can either be classified as active (if evidence of activity exists) or not active. Some patients with RRMS can later exhibit signs of progression (defined as slowly progressive accumulation of disability), and their condition can be reclassified as secondary progressive MS (SPMS). An initial clinical onset of progressive, nonrelapsing symptoms is diagnosed as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Any patients with progressive MS (PPMS or SPMS) can later exhibit signs of activity and/or progression, which allows for further stratification into four categories based on the presence or absence of these qualities."
