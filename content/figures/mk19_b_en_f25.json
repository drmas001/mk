"Calcium homeostasis. Neutral flux of calcium between bone and blood in adults is coordinated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). Whereas most calcium filtered into urine is reabsorbed independent of PTH, PTH further increases retention of calcium from the urine. PTH indirectly augments calcium absorption in the gut by increasing production of 1,25 (OH)",
