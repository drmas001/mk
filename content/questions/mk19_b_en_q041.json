Results were negative. Her symptoms resolved, but then they reappeared 1 week ago. She otherwise has been well and takes no medications."

"). This patient with a multinodular goiter presented with thyrotoxicosis 2 weeks after CT angiography for symptoms that may have been related to mild hyperthyroidism. Administration of iodinated contrast material may cause thyrotoxicosis in some patients with multinodular goiters. An iodine load, such as that associated with iodinated contrast media, initially decreases thyroid hormone production and release, but within 1 to 2 weeks, the effect dissipates, thus leading to thyrotoxicosis. Other sources of possible iodine exposure include medications (amiodarone) and over-the-counter preparations and supplements, including expectorants, vaginal douches, and kelp. The administration of iodinated contrast and other sources of iodine should be avoided in patients with multinodular goiters when possible to avoid precipitating iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Methimazole is an antithyroid drug that blocks further iodine uptake and synthesis of thyroid hormone; propranolol controls the heart rate. Both drugs are indicated in this patient with thyrotoxicosis."

Thyroid scintigraphy with radioactive uptake may a be valid choice 2 to 3 months after iodinated contrast administration, after the excess iodine is cleared from the circulation."
