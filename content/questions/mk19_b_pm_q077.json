"). Preeclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy that is associated with new-onset hypertension, most often occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. Although hypertension is often accompanied by new-onset proteinuria, some women present with hypertension and signs or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction without proteinuria. The presence of one or more of the following findings of end-organ dysfunction indicates a diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features: thrombocytopenia (<100,000/μL [100 × 10",

Patients with preeclampsia are also at risk of developing HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), which has been associated with increased rates of maternal morbidity and mortality. Definitive treatment of severe preeclampsia in patients who are at or beyond 34 weeks' gestation includes emergent management of severe hypertension and prompt delivery."
