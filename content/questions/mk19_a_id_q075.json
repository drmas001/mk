") because WNV encephalitis is most likely in this patient. WNV is an arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes and occurs between June and October in endemic areas. WNV can present with a febrile illness, meningitis, myelitis, or encephalitis. Older adult patients are at higher risk of encephalitis and have a higher mortality. MRI of the brain in this patient is classic, with basal ganglia involvement that can account for tremors, parkinsonism, and myoclonus. WNV can also cause a maculopapular rash. The CSF profile usually shows a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, a normal glucose level, and mildly elevated protein level. The diagnosis is made with a WNV IgM in the CSF or the serum. WNV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (",

") is not helpful in the early diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. Viral antibody titers do rise significantly over the course of the illness but typically do not become positive until 10 to 14 days after illness onset and are therefore not helpful in directing early, appropriate therapy or allowing for discontinuation of unnecessary therapy. HSV encephalitis should be empirically treated with intravenous acyclovir in all patients while awaiting results of the CSF HSV PCR. A delay in acyclovir initiation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The MRI typically shows unilateral temporal lobe enhancement rather than basal ganglia involvement."
