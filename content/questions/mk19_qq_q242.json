") is the most appropriate next step in management. The characteristic features of fibromyalgia are widespread chronic pain, fatigue, and sleep disorders. These features are frequently accompanied by impaired cognitive function; mood disorders; and other symptoms, such as headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, and paresthesia. First-line therapy is nonpharmacologic, particularly aerobic exercise, as well as education and psychosocial support. Several studies have found that low-impact cardiovascular exercise (fast walking, biking, or swimming) can reduce pain, improve function, and may improve sleep. The exercise program should be individualized based on patient preference and any underlying comorbidities. Yoga and tai chi also have shown some benefit in managing pain and dysfunction in patients with fibromyalgia. Patients should be counseled to make gradual and modest increases in the amount and duration of exercise to avoid transient increases in pain and fatigue on initiation of an exercise program. Patients with fibromyalgia should be assessed for psychosocial stressors and psychiatric illness, including a history of trauma. If such stressors or illness is present, referral for psychological care is mandatory because psychic distress may both promote and result from fibromyalgia. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown modest benefit in reducing pain, negative mood, and disability."
