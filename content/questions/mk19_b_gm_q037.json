There is no erythema or edema of eyelids or surrounding eye structures. Funduscopic examination shows cupping of the optic disc. Examination of the left eye is unremarkable; visual acuity is 20/30."

"Attacks of acute ACG more commonly occur in the evening, when lower light levels cause mydriasis and folding back of the iris, blocking the narrow angle. Risk factors for acute ACG include older age; female sex; hyperopia; and receipt of certain drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Common examination findings include a mid-dilated, minimally responsive pupil; conjunctival injection; decreased visual acuity; and globe tenderness to palpation. Funduscopic examination reveals an increased cup-to-disc ratio if chronic ACG is also present. Ophthalmology referral within 1 hour of presentation is necessary to minimize risk for permanent visual loss."
