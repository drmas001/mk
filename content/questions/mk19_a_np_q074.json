Therapeutic lifestyle interventions and pharmacologic therapies were initiated. Medical history is also significant for peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Other medications are glipizide, rosuvastatin, and low-dose aspirin. She lives independently in her own home."

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend an SBP of <130 mm Hg in noninstitutionalized, ambulatory community-dwelling adults ≥65 years of age, whereas the American College of Physicians (ACP)/American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend an SBP of <150 mm Hg in most patients >60 years of age to minimize treatment-related harms. However, ACP/AAFP also recommend considering initiating or intensifying treatment in some adults >60 years of age at high cardiovascular risk to an SBP <140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events. Because this patient with diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and hyperlipidemia is at high risk for stroke or cardiac events, initiation of a second first-line antihypertensive drug such as chlorthalidone or a calcium channel blocker is reasonable."
