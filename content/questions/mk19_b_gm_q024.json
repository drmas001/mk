Medical history is significant for chronic plaque psoriasis that he does not treat. Medications are tiotropium and salmeterol-fluticasone."

"), specifically erythrodermic psoriasis. Erythroderma is a descriptive term for erythema covering greater than 80% body surface area. Up to 40% of cases are idiopathic; exacerbation of a preexisting rash (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) and medication reaction are other common etiologies. Psoriasis can flare violently to erythrodermic psoriasis after exposure to systemic glucocorticoids; for this reason, systemic corticosteroids are very rarely used for treatment of psoriasis. However, patients receiving glucocorticoids for other conditions may develop an erythrodermic flare. Erythrodermic psoriasis can be fatal, with mortality resulting from fluid loss, high-output heart failure, infection, hypothermia, or hypocalcemia (because calcium is consumed during the rapid turnover of keratinocytes)."
