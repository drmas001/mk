"). Acute bilateral lower extremity edema has a broad differential diagnosis. Most diagnoses can be established on the basis of the history or physical examination findings. Medications are a common cause of bilateral lower extremity edema. The most commonly implicated drugs are calcium channel blockers, gabapentin, NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, and thiazolidinediones. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, are associated with lower extremity edema in up to 30% of patients in a dose-dependent fashion. Lower extremity edema occurs because these drugs cause vasodilation, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, which is exacerbated by gravitational forces with standing. The swelling subsides with dose reduction of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or switching to a different class of antihypertensive medication."

"), are generally well tolerated. Although muscle pain and weakness with or without increased creatine kinase levels are commonly reported by patients, muscle symptoms in randomized trials appear to occur equally often in patients taking placebo. Statins may be associated with increases in serum aminotransferase levels, but statin-induced liver injury is rare. Statins also have been associated with the onset of diabetes mellitus, but typically only in patients with preexisting risk factors for diabetes; the beneficial effects of statins on cardiovascular mortality appear to overshadow the risks associated with drug-induced diabetes. Statins are not known to increase peripheral edema."
