") is indicated in this patient with relatively new-onset symptomatic heart failure who is receiving guideline-directed medical therapy. CRT is indicated in patients with an ejection fraction of 35% or less, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, sinus rhythm, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a QRS duration of 150 ms or longer (class 1 recommendation). For patients with LBBB and QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms, CRT can be useful and should be considered (class 2a recommendation). A recent echocardiogram shows that this patient's ejection fraction is still less than 35%, and his ECG shows LBBB; therefore, it would be appropriate to place a biventricular pacemaker (which will improve ejection fraction) with a cardioverter-defibrillator. This therapy would give him a survival benefit over continued medical therapy and improve his functional capacity."

") are placed in the distal pulmonary artery and are used to remotely monitor pulmonary hemodynamics. In the CHAMPION trial, the use of these sensors was shown to reduce heart failure hospitalizations in patients with NYHA class III symptoms compared with patients in the control arm. These monitors are often placed in patients who have frequent hospitalizations to more closely monitor their heart failure hemodynamics, but they have no effect on ejection fraction. Despite significant ongoing symptoms, this patient has not had frequent hospitalizations and would not be a candidate for this device."

There are no guideline recommendations on the use of a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator in patients with heart failure, but this device might be an option for patients at high risk for arrhythmias as a bridge to ICD therapy. Unlike resynchronization therapy, a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator will not improve this patient's ejection fraction."
