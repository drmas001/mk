"A 75-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department for several episodes of maroon blood per rectum and cramping abdominal pain of 18 hours' duration. He is admitted to the hospital and colonoscopy preparation is initiated. He has hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. At a colonoscopy performed 1 week ago, a 1-cm pedunculated polyp was removed from the transverse colon. Medications are apixaban, low-dose aspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin."

Because he has hemodynamically significant lower gastrointestinal bleeding, the initial steps are intravascular resuscitation and withholding apixaban. The duration of the anticoagulant effect of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban, is limited because of their relatively short half-life. In most cases of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, simply holding the DOAC is sufficient."

"Andexanet is a recombinant modified factor Xa protein used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Its use has been associated with serious and life-threatening events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. For life-threatening bleeding related to Xa inhibitors, such as apixaban, the American Society of Hematology suggests stopping the oral direct Xa inhibitor and considering treatment with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or andexanet alfa (",

{

") is substantial. Studies have shown that discontinuation of long-term low-dose aspirin therapy for secondary prevention is associated with a threefold increased risk for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, with 70% of such events occurring within 7 to 10 days of discontinuation. The American College of Gastroenterology and the British Society of Gastroenterology have recommended that to avoid thromboembolic events, aspirin for secondary prophylaxis in patients with established cardiovascular disease should not be discontinued in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. If aspirin is discontinued, it should be restarted as soon as possible following hemostasis."
