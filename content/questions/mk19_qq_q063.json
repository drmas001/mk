"), specifically a subchondral insufficiency fracture. Stress fractures can be categorized as two types: fatigue fracture and insufficiency fracture. A fatigue fracture occurs when there is abnormal loading on normal bone (e.g., athletes with heavy cyclical weight bearing), and an insufficiency fracture occurs when there is normal loading on abnormal bone (e.g., osteoporotic bone). Typically, patients present with pain on activity that is relieved with rest, and point tenderness. The most common location for fatigue fracture is the tibia. Insufficiency fractures typically occur in the spine, sacrum, pelvis, or knee. Insufficiency fracture of the knee has previously been known as spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, but it is now recognized that this entity likely represents subchondral microfractures. It is more common in women and associated with meniscal tears in 80% of cases. Radiography is first-line diagnostic testing but may fail to reveal a fracture. MRI has greater sensitivity; it should be performed when plain films are unrevealing but clinical probability is high. This patient is postmenopausal, putting her at risk for osteoporosis and insufficiency fracture, and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Management is usually conservative with NSAIDs or analgesics and protected weight bearing; studies indicate conflicting results for bisphosphonate therapy. Surgery may be required for severe or large lesions."

") is characterized by diffuse, poorly localized lateral knee and distal thigh pain. Pain is initially present at the end of exercise that involves knee flexion and extension, but it may occur earlier in exercise or with rest as the condition progresses. Running outdoors or downhill may worsen symptoms. On examination, there is often tenderness approximately 2 to 3 cm proximal to the lateral femoral condyle. This patient's joint line pain and imaging study exclude iliotibial band syndrome."

Diagnosis is clinical, although imaging may be required to rule out stress fracture. Treatment includes avoidance of high-impact activities (e.g., running) and using shock-absorbing insoles. The patient's pain description, pain location, and imaging results do not support medial tibial stress syndrome."
