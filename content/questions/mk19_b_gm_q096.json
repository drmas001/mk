"). Dysmenorrhea is characterized by pain and cramping during menstruation and can be associated with low back pain, nausea, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Dysmenorrhea is classified as either primary, when there is no identified cause, or secondary, for which endometriosis is the most common cause. Many women with dysmenorrhea have symptoms severe enough to result in missed school, work, or other activities. Whether primary or secondary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment with either combined hormonal contraceptives (pill, patch, or ring) or progesterone-only methods (pill, injection, implant, or intrauterine device [IUD]) are appropriate options. Before prescribing a combined hormonal contraceptive, it is important to assess for contraindications to estrogen, including a history of venous thromboembolism or migraine with aura. In this patient without contraindications and a need for more effective contraceptive therapy, a combined hormonal oral contraceptive pill is a reasonable option."
