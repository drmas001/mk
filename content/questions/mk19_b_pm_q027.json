"). The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism in the context of pregnancy recommend low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH is strongly recommended over unfractionated heparin (UFH). Antithrombotic therapy markedly reduces mortality in nonpregnant and pregnant patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). LMWH is at least as effective as UFH in the treatment of VTE in pregnant patients, and the risks of bleeding are similar with the two agents. Extended use of UFH during pregnancy is associated with a risk of osteoporotic fracture of 2.2%. There is limited data on bone health in pregnant women receiving LMWH, but in nonpregnant women the risk of fracture appears to be higher in women receiving UFH compared with LMWH. In addition, the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is higher in nonpregnant women treated with UFH compared with LMWH (2.7% versus 0%). Finally, the ASH guideline notes that the dosing of LMWH is more predictable than UFH, and laboratory testing is generally unnecessary, making treatment more convenient."
