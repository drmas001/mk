Splinter hemorrhages are subungual linear pigmented streaks following the long axis of the nail; most are located at the distal one third of the nail. Their color changes from purple to brown or black as they age. Trauma is the most common cause of splinter hemorrhages. Other causes include infective endocarditis, arterial emboli, trichinosis, scurvy, and dermatologic diseases, such as psoriasis."
