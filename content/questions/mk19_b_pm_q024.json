"). The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of allergic asthma; establishing this asthma phenotype can help direct therapy. Clinical characteristics suggesting a type 2 asthma phenotype include atopy, seasonal exacerbations, hay fever, and allergen sensitization. Biomarker evaluation in these patients often demonstrates serum or sputum eosinophilia and/or high IgE levels. This patient has a normal IgE level, but this does not preclude type 2 asthma. Obtaining a blood absolute eosinophil count will help establish the phenotype. In patients with severe disease, elevated levels of IgE and eosinophils are therapeutic targets for biologic therapies. Several types of biologic therapies are available that are directed against type 2 inflammation, targeting pathways involved in activation of eosinophils and IgE production. Use of antibody therapies in eligible patients with severe persistent allergic asthma despite standard therapy reduces symptoms, exacerbations, and need for oral glucocorticoids."

Routine testing is not indicated in patients with asthma."
