"), a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor, is the most appropriate additional treatment. It is the only FDA-approved therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa and is indicated for use in patients with moderate to severe disease. Moderate to severe disease is defined by the presence of multiple recurring nodules or the development of scarring. Hidradenitis suppurativa is an inflammatory skin disorder of the apocrine glands. This disease tends to occur more commonly in women and typically begins after puberty. The pathogenesis of hidradenitis begins with follicular occlusion, but not infection or inflammation of the apocrine glands. After occlusion, secretions build up in the follicular duct and result in rupture and a subsequent inflammatory reaction that resembles a bacterial abscess. An acute inflammatory reaction is then triggered in the surrounding tissue. The role of bacteria is controversial and is likely a secondary colonization, because lesions are initially sterile and antibiotics are not entirely effective in preventing new lesions. The chronic and recurrent nature of hidradenitis suppurativa helps distinguish it from other infectious causes. Areas frequently affected are intertriginous areas, such as the axilla, groin, and underneath the breasts. The condition is characterized by comedones, painful nodules, abscesses, draining sinuses, and scarring. Risk factors include obesity, metabolic syndrome, cigarette smoking, and family history. For this reason, weight loss and smoking cessation are an essential part of the treatment plan. Hidradenitis suppurativa is extremely difficult to treat. No single treatment has been effective for all patients; however, several options are available. Decolonization with dilute bleach baths and chlorhexidine washes may be used in addition to topical clindamycin as initial therapy. For more extensive or resistant disease, common systemic treatments include oral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines or the combination of clindamycin and rifampin. This patient with several active lesions and scarring is experiencing moderate to severe disease, and treatment with adalimumab is indicated."

The EHR is a computerized system that encompasses patient record review and treatment-ordering functionality for clinicians. The EHR enables the timely sharing of patient information by multiple users, resulting in improved communication and care efficiency. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) is a system by which clinicians electronically enter medication, radiology, and laboratory orders, thereby reducing errors and delays related to illegible handwriting. Computerized CDS is the use of information technology to facilitate clinical decision making. When integrated into a CPOE system, CDS can highlight potential contraindications to diagnostic tests, specify dose recommendations, identify potential drug interactions, and suggest modifications to drug dosage in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction. In this case, the physician was going to prescribe this patient full-dose rivaroxaban to reduce the risk for stroke caused by atrial fibrillation. However, many direct oral anticoagulants require dosage adjustment in patients with advanced kidney disease because decreased kidney clearance of these medications may be associated with adverse events. The CDS system notified the physician of the contraindication to use full-dose rivaroxaban in this patient and prevented the potential harm."

") to avoid an adrenal crisis. Patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy may be at risk for secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) and perioperative adrenal crisis. Historically, increased glucocorticoid doses (stress dosing) were administered liberally in the perioperative period to mimic the natural response of the adrenal glands to physiologic stress. However, studies have shown that stress dosing may not be required in many patients receiving low-dose and short-course glucocorticoid therapy. When managing a patient with glucocorticoid exposure within the past year, considerations include the type of surgery (low, intermediate, or high risk) and the dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy. Patients on high doses of glucocorticoids for extended periods (equivalent of >20 mg/d prednisone for >3 weeks) are at high risk for AI and should receive stress dosing when undergoing intermediate- to high-risk surgery. These patients may not need glucocorticoid support for a low-risk procedure, such as cataract surgery. Patients at low risk for AI (those taking low doses of glucocorticoids for shorter periods) can generally proceed to surgery of any risk level without stress-dose glucocorticoids. Patients at moderate risk for AI may require testing to assess for the presence of adrenal insufficiency before determining best perioperative management, although newer guidelines suggest treating empirically with stress-dose glucocorticoids for a large proportion of this intermediate-risk group. This patient is at moderate risk for AI because she received more than 5 mg/d of prednisone during the past year; previously required supplemental glucocorticoids during another major operation; and is undergoing total knee arthroplasty, which is an intermediate-risk procedure.

") in this patient who most likely has a malignant melanoma. Melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancer–related deaths, and early detection and diagnosis are imperative. Skin biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. An excisional biopsy, a technique in which the entire lesion is removed using 1- to 2-mm peripheral margins, is the most appropriate biopsy technique. For localized melanomas, prognosis is related to the depth of invasion, either by Clark level (I to V) or by Breslow depth. A high mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, and the presence of bleeding or ulceration are poor prognostic signs. As the depth of invasion increases, the risk for nodal and ultimately distant metastasis increases. Lesion depth also informs the nature of definitive excision. A margin of 1 cm is acceptable for lesions that are less than 1 mm in thickness. Melanomas between 1 mm and 2 mm in thickness should be resected with a 2-cm margin, provided that a skin graft is not required for closure. Lesions that are greater than 2 mm in thickness should also be resected with 2-cm margins."

Additional criteria for bariatric surgery include sustained unsuccessful weight loss attempts using high-intensity lifestyle modification programs, structured meal plans, and/or pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery reliably results in weight loss and may also produce improvements in diabetes control, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Cardiovascular and overall mortality may also be improved in patients with severe obesity. It may also durably improve or reverse some of the medical complications associated with obesity, such as obstructive sleep apnea and osteoarthritis. Patients should have acceptable operative risk, understand the necessity of lifelong dietary and lifestyle measures for sustained weight loss, and be willing to adhere to lifelong follow-up. Candidates should not have psychological conditions that impede adherence to these requirements."

"). Owing to both their disease and its treatment, patients with rheumatologic disease undergoing elective surgery are at higher risk for perioperative infectious complications, including risk for peri–prosthetic joint infection in total joint arthroplasties of the hip and knee. Appropriate management of antirheumatic medication in the perioperative period mitigates this risk. Elective surgery should be delayed until the underlying disease is controlled and preferably in remission, because this is associated with reduced infection risk and improved outcomes. All nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be continued throughout the perioperative period in patients undergoing elective joint replacement. Evidence suggests that continuing DMARDs is associated with a lower risk for infections versus discontinuing DMARDs at the time of surgery. Disease flares are also less frequent after surgery in patients who continue DMARDs perioperatively. Biologic agents, such as adalimumab (",
{

"), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). All patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) must have a thorough medication history performed to determine whether a medication is contributing to or causing the ED. SSRIs are commonly associated with decreased libido and ED, both of which this patient reports. For patients with depression, the American Psychiatric Association recommends continuation therapy (treatment after resolution of a major depressive episode) for 4 to 9 months in patients who responded to acute therapy for a first episode of depression. Antidepressant medications can then be gradually tapered. Because this patient reports no depressive symptoms and has been treated for 8 months, the most appropriate step is a trial taper of sertraline. If his mood worsens when the sertraline is tapered, initiation of the dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor bupropion could be considered. Bupropion is typically not associated with ED but can rarely (<1%) be associated with ejaculatory disorders. In addition to antidepressants, other medications commonly implicated in ED are antihypertensive medications, such as β-blockers, spironolactone, thiazide diuretics, and clonidine."

Motivational interviewing is a counseling approach that uses directive, patient-centered techniques. Its overall goal is to assist patients in addressing and changing unhealthy behaviors. Motivational interviewing capitalizes on the patient's intrinsic motivation to change and identifies reasons for ambivalence to change and discusses them without directly confronting the patient. Foundational to motivational interviewing is the physician's attempt to understand the patient's perspectives, followed by having the patient reflect on the need for change by highlighting the discrepancy between the patient's current and desired behavior. The physician attempts to build rapport and engage the patient with a supportive, nonjudgmental attitude. The physician elicits ideas and feelings about current behaviors and how they match the patient's desires and values, and has the patient reflect on the possibility of better options compared with current behaviors. The conversation allows identification of specific changes important to the patient. In a process known as change talk, the physician elicits the patient's own reasons and rationale for change. Motivational interviewing can be particularly effective in establishing a partnership to create lifestyle changes and may be highly relevant in this patient, who is currently not motivated to make lifestyle changes."

According to the 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology guideline, mild bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, and it typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults. Use of topical antibacterial therapy is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission compared with placebo in days 2 to 5 of treatment. Treatment may reduce transmissibility. The choice of antibiotic is usually empiric. Because a course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected; there is no clinical evidence suggesting the superiority of any particular antibiotic. Although there are no data supporting the cost-effectiveness of using antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis, the shortened morbidity associated with their use makes choice of therapy an individual decision. Trimethoprim-polymyxin ophthalmic solution is an appropriate antibiotic option for patients, such as this one, who do not wear contact lenses. Other reasonable options are erythromycin or bacitracin-polymyxin ophthalmic ointments. Lack of symptom improvement or symptom worsening within several days of initiation of an appropriate topical antimicrobial should prompt ophthalmology referral."

Frailty is a multifactorial state of decreased physiologic reserves and increased vulnerability to stressors. In persons older than 65 years, the estimated incidence of frailty is 10% to 20% and increases with each decade. Standardized indices to objectively measure frailty include the Frailty Index, the frailty phenotype, the FRAIL (Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of weight) scale, and the Osteoporotic Fractures Frailty Scale. The FRAIL scale is the easiest to administer and score. In the perioperative period, frailty is associated with higher rates of complications, prolonged hospital stays, and increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Frailty is a risk factor for poor surgical outcomes, and thus it is important to engage the frail patient and family in conversations around decision making before elective surgeries. A frailty assessment may inform discussions with the patient and family regarding surgical techniques, pre- and postoperative strategies to minimize risk, and likely outcomes."

One point is assigned for each “yes” response about Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apneas, elevated blood Pressure, BMI >35, Age >50 years, Neck circumference >40 cm, and male Gender.

However, patients receiving glucocorticoids for other conditions may develop an erythrodermic flare.

"). This patient has premature ejaculation, which is defined as ejaculation with minimal stimulation that occurs earlier than desired. Premature ejaculation that causes self-reported psychological distress in the patient or partner is an indication for treatment. The diagnosis of premature ejaculation is solely based on history. Clinicians should obtain a thorough sexual history (frequency of premature ejaculation, antecedent sexual activities, aggravating and alleviating factors, the impact of premature ejaculation, and any concomitant erectile dysfunction). Assessment for an underlying mood condition is also imperative, given the association between premature ejaculation and development of poor self-esteem and depression. Although the specific pathophysiologic mechanism of premature ejaculation is unknown, dysfunction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors and penile hypersensitivity are believed to be involved. Paroxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line therapy and are the most appropriate pharmacologic management option for this patient. A meta-analysis of available trials suggests that paroxetine may be the most effective SSRI. Complete therapeutic response typically occurs within 2 to 3 weeks of continuous use. Owing to upregulation of 5-HT receptors, therapeutic benefit may decline after 6 to 12 months. The combination of a SSRI plus a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor may be the most effective treatment for premature ejaculation but is associated with more side effects than monotherapies."

Lung cancer has a poor prognosis, and nearly 90% of persons with lung cancer die of the disease. However, early-stage non–small cell lung cancer has a better prognosis and can be treated with surgical resection. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend lung cancer screening with an annual low-dose CT scan for persons aged 50 years to 80 years with at least a 20-pack-year smoking history and who are still smoking or who quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. Shared decision making, including providing patients with information about radiation exposure with CT, risk for false-positive diagnoses, and anxiety related to surveillance of slow-growing lung nodules, is a crucial element in making the decision to screen. Screening alone cannot prevent most lung cancer–related deaths, and smoking cessation is essential. This patient has a significant smoking history within the past 15 years and should be offered screening."

Nail psoriasis typically occurs in patients with psoriasis, but occasionally the nail changes may precede the skin changes. A family history of psoriasis can be helpful, as can a through physical examination looking for “hidden” areas of plaque psoriasis in the gluteal cleft, periumbilically, in the concha of the ear, and on the scalp.

Overtesting in the preoperative period is common and leads to higher costs and additional downstream testing, which can cause harm. Preoperative hemoglobin testing is indicated in a patient with signs or symptoms suggestive of anemia, recent blood loss, use of medications that could affect hematopoiesis, or anticipated significant blood loss. Patient-related factors that may drive preoperative serum creatinine testing include hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiac disease, and medications that affect kidney function. Total hip arthroplasty is associated with significant blood loss, and establishing the patient's baseline hemoglobin level will be helpful. This patient has hypertension and is taking lisinopril, both of which can alter kidney function, and serum creatinine measurement is indicated."

Guidelines recommend bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI of 40 or greater or for those with a BMI of 35 or greater who have at least one serious weight-related comorbid condition, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, or knee or hip osteoarthritis. Sleeve gastrectomy is accomplished by excising the part of the stomach along the greater curvature, creating an approximately 85% reduction in size of the stomach. It results in restriction of caloric intake via early satiety with a smaller stomach and hormonal (glucagon-like peptide-1 and related hormones) appetite suppression. The smaller gastric surface area also results in less production of ghrelin, an appetite stimulant. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has the most efficacy data and remains superior to other procedures for weight loss, but it also has the highest rate of early postoperative complications. RYGB consists of creating a small proximal gastric pouch separate from the distal stomach and creating a biliopancreatic limb that connects the Roux limb to the gastrojejunostomy. The weight loss with sleeve gastrectomy is less than RYGB surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy, however, is associated with fewer major surgical complications at 30 days than other forms of bariatric surgery. After 5 years, the two bariatric procedures do not differ in regard to health-related quality of life or major complications."

Conductive hearing loss is more often associated with pain or ear drainage, whereas sensorineural hearing loss is more often accompanied by tinnitus or vertigo. In patients with hearing loss, physical examination should include otoscopic examination as well as the Weber and Rinne tests. The Weber test assesses sensorineural hearing. In the Weber test, a 256-Hz vibrating tuning fork is applied to the midline forehead, bridge of the nose, or teeth. A normal result is no lateralization of loudness of the sound (sound loudness equal in both ears). In the presence of sensorineural hearing loss, the sound lateralizes (is louder) in the uninvolved ear. In this patient, the sound was louder in the right ear; thus, the left ear is impaired. The Rinne test assesses conductive hearing. In this test, the patient is asked to identify whether the tuning fork sound is louder when placed on the mastoid process (bone conduction) or when placed in front of the external auditory canal (air conduction). A normal test is associated with air conduction louder than bone conduction. This patient, with a Weber test that lateralizes to the right ear (the “good ear”) and normal conduction in the left ear (air conduction greater than bone conduction) has sensorineural hearing loss of the left ear. The most concerning condition causing chronic unilateral sensorineural hearing loss with tinnitus is an acoustic neuroma. The first diagnostic step is confirmation of the hearing loss with audiometry followed by MRI of the internal auditory meatus."

Initiation of systemic antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) can help attenuate the duration of rash and symptoms during a herpes zoster outbreak and reduce the risk for postherpetic neuralgia if administered within the first 72 hours after onset of symptoms. Valacyclovir and famciclovir are often preferred because of possible increased efficacy and decreased frequency of dosing compared with acyclovir. This effect is best established in patients older than 50 years. Varicella-zoster virus is a DNA virus that causes varicella (chickenpox), which is an acute illness with fever and an eruption of vesicles on an erythematous base that is transmitted by respiratory droplets. After primary infection, the virus remains latent in the dorsal root or cranial ganglia. Reactivation causes herpes zoster. Prodromal symptoms, such as burning, stinging, or tingling, often occur in a localized region, followed by a dermatomal eruption of grouped vesicles or pustules on an erythematous base. The most common dermatomes affected are in the thoracic region. With involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve (forehead extending over upper eyelid, or nasal tip involvement), ophthalmologic evaluation is mandatory because herpes zoster ophthalmicus and possible blindness can result. If vesicles are noted in the external ear canal, evaluation by an otolaryngologist may be required because peripheral facial paralysis and auditory/vestibular symptoms can occur (Ramsay Hunt syndrome)."

Recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) are similar and state that screening can be discontinued at age 65 years in patients who have appropriate negative screening in the preceding 10 years and who do not have a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more significant disease in the preceding past 25 years. Women older than 65 years who have never been screened or in whom the adequacy of prior screening cannot be confirmed, such as this patient, should undergo screening. There is up to a 74% mortality reduction from cervical cancer in women who have never been screened. Currently, two FDA-approved primary HPV tests are available for cervical cancer screening, and both are approved as standalone cervical screening tests beginning at age 25 years. Five HPV tests are FDA-approved for co-testing (HPV testing plus cytology). The USPSTF recommends screening with cytology every 3 years, primary high-risk HPV testing every 5 years, or co-testing every 5 years. The ACS favors primary HPV testing every 5 years. When primary HPV testing is unavailable, the ACS recommends HPV co-testing every 5 years or, alternatively, cytology alone every 3 years."

The overproduction of mucosal secretions is caused by infection of epithelial cells responsible for the mucociliary layer within the respiratory tract and oropharynx. Symptoms of an uncomplicated URI may persist for up to 2 weeks after initial infection, and cough may persist even after resolution of the acute illness. Treatment for the common cold focuses on symptom management, including reducing severity of discomfort caused by frequent coughing, sneezing, headache, sore throat, and malaise. Analgesics may help with myalgia and headache, whereas nasal symptoms may respond to intranasal cromolyn, intranasal ipratropium, or combination decongestant/antihistamines."

Failure of medical management for abnormal uterine bleeding is another indication for endometrial biopsy. Because this patient is 39 years old and obese, she is at increased risk for endometrial cancer and should undergo endometrial biopsy to evaluate for hyperplasia or malignancy. In postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding, transvaginal ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the thickness of the endometrial lining; an endometrial thickness greater than 4 mm may indicate hyperplasia or malignancy and biopsy is indicated. However, in premenopausal women, endometrial thickness is not a reliable indicator because it varies with the menstrual cycle. Although transvaginal ultrasonography may be appropriate to evaluate for structural causes of abnormal bleeding, it does not substitute for an endometrial biopsy and biopsy is usually performed regardless of the ultrasound findings."

Although breast cancer should be considered in all patients, most breast masses, particularly in women younger than 30 years, are benign conditions, such as cysts, fibroadenomas, fat necrosis, or lipomas. Evaluation requires consideration of breast cancer risk factors, including family history of breast or ovarian cancer; previous breast biopsies; hormonal risk factors; and a detailed history of the mass, including onset, changes with the menstrual cycle, associated symptoms, and overlying skin/nipple changes. Women younger than 30 years who present with a breast mass should first be evaluated with breast ultrasonography. Younger women have increased breast density, which decreases the sensitivity of mammography. Ultrasonography is also the preferred imaging modality in pregnant women to avoid radiation exposure. Breast ultrasound results are categorized by Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) criteria. Biopsy is recommended for category 4 and 5 findings. In addition, any suspicious findings, including a hard, fixed, or heterogenous mass on clinical breast examination (CBE), should be evaluated by biopsy, even if imaging is negative."

It is essential to instruct patients who are prescribed PDE-5 inhibitors on proper use: The medication should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before sexual activity, and efficacy may be decreased if taken after consumption of a high-fat meal. PDE-5 inhibitors should not be prescribed to patients on nitrates because of the risk for hypotension. Similarly, they should be used with caution in the setting of concomitant α-blocker therapy.

"), which is causing a painless visual field defect. Her symptoms of visual loss, flashing lights, and floaters should raise suspicion for this diagnosis, which can be confirmed by an ophthalmologist using indirect ophthalmoscopy or wide-field retinal photography. Indirect ophthalmoscopy using a condensing lens provides the ophthalmologist a wide field of vision of the retina and three-dimensional views showing elevation and depth. Because retinal detachment typically occurs far into the periphery, office-based direct ophthalmoscopy will likely be normal or at least nondiagnostic. Floaters may be described by patients as a “cobweb” and represent accompanying posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). This patient likely developed a PVD in the days preceding her presentation, which led to a retinal tear. Flashing lights represent vitreoretinal attachments stimulating retinal depolarization as they pull away from the retina. Larger retinal detachments cause more severe visual disturbances. Risk factors for retinal detachment include increasing age, myopia, and recent cataract surgery. This patient requires immediate ophthalmology referral for diagnosis and treatment to prevent further vision loss."

Vitiligo can be diagnosed clinically and presents as depigmented, well-demarcated symmetric macules or patches without scale that appear most commonly on the hands, extensor surfaces, and periorificial areas. Wood lamp examination showing intense whiteness can help confirm the diagnosis. Skin biopsies are often unnecessary but will show absence of melanocytes.

The timing of warfarin discontinuation is based on its 36- to 42-hour half-life and clinical studies documenting the time for the INR to return to normal following discontinuation. In general, 2 to 3 days are required for the INR to drop below 2 and 4 to 6 days for the INR to normalize. Some physicians obtain an INR on day 4 and intervene with vitamin K supplementation if necessary for persistently elevated INRs. Postoperative re-initiation of anticoagulation should be guided by the patient's thrombotic and bleeding risk and determined in collaboration with the surgical team. Owing to its delayed effect, the first dose of warfarin is typically administered 12 to 24 hours after surgery, pending adequate hemostasis and barring any surgical complications that may increase the risk for bleeding. It usually takes 5 to 6 days to achieve a therapeutic INR."

"). Emergency contraception refers to postcoital contraception using a device or medication to prevent pregnancy after inadequately protected intercourse. All forms of emergency contraception work by disrupting ovulation or preventing fertilization of an egg. Emergency contraceptives are not abortion-inducing interventions. FDA-approved options for emergency contraception include oral ulipristal acetate, oral levonorgestrel, or a copper intrauterine device (IUD). New data suggest that the 52-mg levonorgestrel IUD is noninferior to the copper IUD for emergency contraception, but it is not currently FDA approved for this indication. Ulipristal acetate delays ovulation. It is the preferred oral contraceptive option for women with a BMI greater than 26, such as this patient. A single oral dose of ulipristal acetate is effective for up to 5 days after unprotected sexual intercourse. Although a prescription is required for oral ulipristal acetate, an in-person medical visit is not required to provide this form of emergency contraception. The copper IUD is FDA approved for use as emergency contraception and is the most effective form of emergency contraception; it can reduce the risk for pregnancy by 99% if placed within 5 days of unprotected sexual intercourse. Copper IUDs prevent fertilization by unknown mechanisms and require a clinic visit for insertion."

Allergic conjunctivitis is due to IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, with the resultant release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. In addition to basic eye care, including cold compresses, and avoiding eye rubbing and known allergens, topical pharmacotherapy is indicated for this patient given the degree of his symptoms. Topical agents in this category include olopatadine, alcaftadine, bepotastine, azelastine hydrochloride, cetirizine, epinastine, ketotifen fumarate, and emedastine. Generic ketotifen fumarate does not require a prescription. Although the full effect of these agents may take days, some effect is seen immediately. An advantage of this class of drugs is that it is administered only once or twice daily, depending on the specific formulation. The most common side effect is burning and stinging with application, which may be mitigated by using refrigerated agents."

") is the most appropriate colorectal screening test for this patient. There is significant variation among colorectal cancer screening guidelines. The American College of Physicians suggests colonoscopy every 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus FIT every 2 years, or FIT or high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing every 2 years as acceptable screening regimens. In contrast, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), an initiative of U.S. gastroenterology societies, has ranked colorectal cancer screening tests in tiers based on the available evidence, cost-effectiveness, test availability, and several other factors. The MSTF recommends colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT as first-tier tests; CT colonography every 5 years, FIT-fecal DNA testing every 3 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years as second-tier tests; and capsule colonography every 5 years as a third-tier test. Screening would be most appropriate among adults who (1) are healthy enough to undergo treatment if colorectal cancer is detected and (2) do not have comorbid conditions that would significantly limit their life expectancy. Because there are no head-to-head comparisons of the various screening modalities for colorectal cancer, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force makes a practical recommendation that the best screening modality is the one the patient is willing to complete. For this patient, FIT may have certain desirable advantages. FIT has improved accuracy compared with guaiac fecal occult blood test and does not require bowel preparation, anesthesia, or transportation to and from the screening examination."

Menopause occurring in women older than 40 years, such as this patient, requires no additional laboratory or diagnostic evaluation. Menopause occurring in women younger than 40 years should be evaluated for premature ovarian insufficiency and other disorders by obtaining follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin levels; on the basis of results of these studies, additional evaluation may be required. Symptoms of menopause include vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats). Hot flushes generally start in the perimenopausal period and can last for a few years to lifelong. Women may experience other symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and irritability, but it is unclear whether these symptoms can be attributed to menopause. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause results from estrogen deficiency and is characterized by vaginal symptoms, such as burning or irritation; sexual symptoms, such as dyspareunia or sexual dysfunction; or urinary symptoms, such as dysuria or recurrent urinary infections."

Melasma is a hyperpigmentation disorder resulting in tan to dark brown reticulated patches, mostly on the sun-exposed areas on the face (malar, mandibular, and centrofacial regions, including the forehead) and the upper extremities. It is exacerbated with sun exposure. Melasma most commonly affects women of childbearing age; it occurs more frequently and is more noticeable in patients with darker skin. Causes of melasma are hormonal factors (pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives), ultraviolet (UV) light, and genetic predisposition. The most essential element of management of melasma is strict sun protection with sun avoidance, use of sunscreen, and wearing sun-protective clothing. Melasma can occasionally resolve after pregnancy or with cessation of oral contraceptive use but may persist or recur with UV light exposure. Treatment is challenging and, in addition to strict sun protection and avoidance, involves topical depigmenting agents, such as hydroquinone. Laser therapy; chemical peels; and oral agents, such as tranexamic acid, are other treatment options. It may take months to years for pigmentation to normalize."

"). This patient has a classic presentation of testicular torsion, a twisting of the spermatic cord contents resulting in testicular ischemia. Testicular torsion is most common in children and young adults and presents as acute unilateral scrotal pain and swelling. Examination reveals elevation of the involved scrotum and an absent cremasteric reflex (failure of the testis to elevate when the ipsilateral inner thigh is stroked). Decreased blood flow seen on Doppler ultrasound is typical. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, and this patient should undergo immediate surgical exploration. The time from symptom onset to surgical exploration is the most important determining factor of testicular viability. If surgical exploration is performed within 6 hours of symptom onset, the testis remains viable in 90% to 100% of cases. Testicular viability drops to 50% if surgery is not performed until 12 hours after presentation and to less than 10% if performed 24 hours or more after presentation. If surgery is not readily available, an attempt to untwist the testicle manually is warranted. Even if successful, follow-up surgery is typically required."

"). Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a significant risk factor for recurrent stroke in general and during the perioperative period and also increases the risk for a major adverse cardiac event. Historically, it has been recommended to delay elective noncardiac surgery for a minimum of 3 months following stroke or TIA owing to unacceptably high risk for recurrent stroke and impaired cerebral autoregulation during that time frame. However, more recent data show that this exceedingly high risk for recurrent stroke persists longer than 3 months, gradually returning to a new baseline 9 to 12 months after the event, at which point it still remains elevated compared with persons who never had a stroke or TIA. Although surgeries deemed more time sensitive or urgent may proceed after 3 months, it is most prudent to wait at least 6 months after a prior stroke, and possibly as long as 9 months prior to elective procedures. It is also important to note that secondary stroke prophylaxis with antiplatelet agents is often held for prolonged periods before and after spine surgery owing to bleeding risks, rendering the patient at even greater risk for recurrent stroke."

"). During the perioperative period, patients with cirrhosis are at significantly greater risk for electrolyte abnormalities, fluid imbalance, delirium, kidney failure, worsening liver dysfunction, impaired clearance of medications, infection, bleeding, clotting, and death. The likelihood of poor outcomes increases with the extent of liver disease as measured by Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) or Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. The MELD score incorporates the INR, serum total bilirubin level, and serum creatinine levels. A progressive increase in perioperative mortality for all procedures is observed as MELD scores rise. Patients who have MELD scores below 8 to 10 generally do well perioperatively provided that their liver disease is stable and compensated, and it is reasonable to proceed with most surgeries with optimal medical management. When a MELD score is greater than 20, mortality rates increase to a degree that precludes all but the most urgent surgeries for life-threatening illness. A MELD score of 14 (as this patient has) indicates intermediate risk for surgery-related complications, and the risks and benefits of the anticipated elective surgery should be discussed with the patient after the perioperative evaluation."

Pharmacotherapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, and women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy while using these medications. The goal of pharmacotherapy is weight loss of 5% or more during the first 3 to 6 months. If this target is not reached, use of the medication should be discontinued. Weight is typically regained once pharmacotherapy is discontinued, which underscores the importance of concomitant lifestyle changes. The potential weight loss benefit of pharmacotherapy should be balanced against risk for adverse events and cost.

This patient has a 10-year ASCVD risk greater than 10% and may be considered for aspirin therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD. Tempering the recommendation for primary prevention of ASCVD with aspirin are multiple trials, including ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE, and a 2019 meta-analysis showing no net mortality benefit with aspirin; reductions in nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke were offset by an increased risk for major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. Factors that increase risk for bleeding include increasing age, male sex, concurrent anticoagulant or NSAID use, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, upper gastrointestinal pain, uncontrolled hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and thrombocytopenia. Because of these data, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommended that aspirin should be used infrequently in primary prevention of ASCVD and that low-dose (81 mg/d) aspirin (",

") are recognized strategies to increase medication adherence. Both methods are usually acceptable to patients. Selecting a medication with the lowest copayment is challenging because it requires physicians to maintain knowledge of various and shifting copayments with a large number of insurance companies and is time intensive, and its impact is unknown. More important, it appears that the primary reason for this patient's nonadherence was lack of understanding of the prolonged treatment duration for deep venous thrombosis. Patient education is more likely to increase medication adherence than either a pill box or lowest copayment."

Clinicians can address low health literacy by using techniques to improve patient understanding, such as repeating information and supplying the patient with educational materials written in plain language. The teach-back method, wherein the clinician asks patients to describe their understanding of instructions in their own words, is especially helpful in rapidly identifying a potential health literacy problem before a patient leaves a medical setting. The teach-back method coupled with education about the patient's medical problem and need for prolonged treatment is more likely to increase medication adherence than is screening for low health literacy alone."

The 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for VTE prophylaxis in patients with cancer recommends pharmacologic prophylaxis for hospitalized patients with active cancer in the absence of bleeding or other contraindications. Patients should be offered pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with either unfractionated heparin or LMWH. Prophylaxis should commence in the hours immediately preceding surgery and may be combined with mechanical methods, such as intermittent pneumatic compression. A combined regimen of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis may be superior, especially in the highest-risk patients. Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing major surgery for cancer should be continued for at least 7 to 10 days. Extended prophylaxis with LMWH for up to 4 weeks postoperatively is recommended for patients undergoing major open or laparoscopic abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer who have high-risk features, such as restricted mobility, obesity, or history of VTE, or who have additional risk factors.

Seborrheic keratoses range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters, are usually hyperpigmented, and range in color from tan to brown or black. The sign of Leser–Trélat is the sudden eruption of numerous seborrheic keratoses and is associated with an internal malignancy. Diagnosis of seborrheic keratoses can usually be made clinically, but shave biopsy can be confirmatory when there is concern for melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Reassurance is typically the appropriate management, but seborrheic keratoses are often treated if irritated or pruritic, such as in this patient, or for cosmetic reasons. Seborrheic keratosis usually become irritated and inflamed owing to chronic friction from clothing, but inflammation of seborrheic keratoses may occur during chemotherapy; cytarabine and docetaxel are the most implicated drugs. When indicated, the most common treatment is cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, but only if the diagnosis is certain. Otherwise, a shave removal and submission for histologic evaluation is most appropriate. Other destructive therapies include curettage, electrodessication, or laser therapy."

It can progress to complete loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) and all of the body (alopecia universalis). Other than the hair loss, alopecia areata is usually asymptomatic. On examination, “exclamation point” hairs, which are small broken hairs at the edges of the hair loss that are thicker at the top and thinner near the scalp, can be observed; these are a pathognomonic indicator of alopecia areata. The pathogenesis of alopecia areata is not fully understood, but an autoimmune process is postulated. Alopecia areata can be associated with atopic dermatitis, asthma, thyroid disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients with mild disease will often have spontaneous hair regrowth. More extensive involvement at onset has a poorer prognosis. Treatment includes potent topical or intralesional glucocorticoids for limited disease."

ACP believes that it is the responsibility of the medical profession to become cost-conscious and decrease unnecessary care that does not benefit patients. ACP has developed a five-step framework to assist physicians in delivering high value care: (1) understand the benefits, harms, and relative costs of the interventions that being considered; (2) decrease or eliminate the use of interventions that provide no benefits and/or may be harmful; (3) choose interventions and care settings that maximize benefits, minimize harms, and reduce costs (using comparative-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data); (4) customize a care plan with the patient that incorporates their values and addresses their concerns; and (5) identify system-level opportunities to improve outcomes, minimize harms, and reduce health care waste. Not performing unnecessary testing, as shown in this case, is an example of high value care."

However, there is considerable overuse of preoperative testing, particularly in low-risk procedures. When determining appropriate preoperative testing for elective procedures, the first branch-point is determining the risk of surgery. In general, low-risk surgeries (such as skin surgeries, hernia repair, cataract surgery, and arthroscopy) are of shorter duration, involve local anesthetics, incur minimal blood loss, and are associated with few complications (<1% major adverse cardiac events). Multiple studies have shown that preoperative testing has little value in low-risk procedures. Even when patients have substantial comorbidities, such as this patient, chest radiography, echocardiography, and ECG do not predict cardiac complications. Therefore, provided medical issues are stable, preoperative testing is not recommended for low-risk procedures."

"). Preparticipation physical examination is often required for adolescents and young adults before participation in organized sports. The goal of a preparticipation physical evaluation is to determine an individual's safe participation in sports, although studies have not found that the preparticipation screening examination prevents morbidity and mortality associated with sports. Advocates claim that it may detect conditions that predispose the athlete to injury or illness, which then may guide advice or intervention. The examination should not be a barrier to competitive sports participation, and unnecessary testing should be avoided owing to its attendant costs and unintended consequences, such as downstream testing for incidental findings. Mandatory components include evaluating for exertional symptoms, family history of premature or sudden cardiac death, and presence of a heart murmur. Routine testing beyond the history and physical examination is not necessary unless concerning symptoms and physical findings are uncovered. This patient has exercise-induced bronchospasm but an unlimited exercise capacity and no other concerning symptoms or physical findings. There is no indication for testing."

This patient has none of these findings, and echocardiography is not necessary. An ECG is clearly indicated if the patient has unexplained syncope; palpitations; or a family history of sudden death that is suggestive of a congenital abnormality, such as long QT syndrome.

It usually presents as pink, scaly, indurated plaques, papules, or nodules that can ulcerate, bleed, or become crusty. SCCs tend to retain their surface scale, and as an SCC accumulates a large amount of scale, it is called a cutaneous horn. Risk factors are exposure to UV light, ionizing radiation, or chemical carcinogens (coal tar, soot, and arsenic); viruses (human papillomavirus); and immunosuppression (organ transplant, hematologic malignancies, HIV infection). SCC on the central face, lips, or ear, as seen in this patient, is considered high risk and should be treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. Mohs micrographic surgery is a highly specialized surgical technique that combines pathology and surgery for complete margin control and tissue conservation. It is appropriately used for cancers in the head and neck region, those that are large or recurrent, or those in areas where tissue-sparing is critical for function."

Phototoxic drug reactions usually present as exaggerated sunburn due to direct cellular injury. Unlike photoallergic reactions, they are not immunologically mediated and do not require prior sensitization; reactions occur minutes to hours after sun exposure. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are one of the most common causes of phototoxic drug reactions. In addition to exaggerated sunburn, tetracycline-induced phototoxicity may present with photo-onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed) and pseudoporphyria. Minocycline may cause less photosensitization than other tetracyclines. Other common causes of phototoxic reactions include sulfonamides, hydrochlorothiazide, fluoroquinolones, antimalarials, amiodarone, and voriconazole. Discontinuation of the photosensitizing drug and sun avoidance measures will lead to resolution of the reaction. Topical glucocorticoids can be used for symptomatic treatment."

Dysmenorrhea is classified as either primary, when there is no identified cause, or secondary, for which endometriosis is the most common cause. Many women with dysmenorrhea have symptoms severe enough to result in missed school, work, or other activities. Whether primary or secondary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment with either combined hormonal contraceptives (pill, patch, or ring) or progesterone-only methods (pill, injection, implant, or intrauterine device [IUD]) are appropriate options. Before prescribing a combined hormonal contraceptive, it is important to assess for contraindications to estrogen, including a history of venous thromboembolism or migraine with aura. In this patient without contraindications and a need for more effective contraceptive therapy, a combined hormonal oral contraceptive pill is a reasonable option."

Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive, is simple to perform, has high sensitivity (94%-100%) and specificity (98%-100%) for detecting AAA, and does not expose patients to radiation. Abdominal ultrasonography screening can also be performed selectively in men in the same age range who have not smoked but are at increased risk for peripheral vascular disease or who have a first-degree relative who had an AAA (grade C). The USPSTF assessed the benefits of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked as uncertain and makes no recommendation regarding screening in this population (I statement). The USPSTF specifically recommends against routine screening in women who have never smoked and who have no family history of AAA (grade D).

SJS and TEN are a spectrum of severe mucocutaneous reactions defined by the extent of affected BSA involved with immune-mediated cutaneous necrosis. If 10% to 30% body surface area is affected, as in this patient, the reaction is termed SJS/TEN overlap syndrome. Symptoms of SJS/TEN usually begin within 1 to 3 weeks of exposure to the inciting agent. Fever, malaise, and symptoms of upper respiratory infection are followed by skin pain, grittiness or sand-like irritation of the eyes, and odynophagia. Within several days of symptom onset, patients develop red or purple dusky macules on the trunk that progress to vesicles, erosions, and ulceration. Painful erosions develop in the mouth, eyes, or genitals in as many as 95% of patients. When SJS/TEN is considered to be a possible diagnosis, the most important first step is to immediately discontinue all nonessential medications because continued exposure to the offending agent can worsen outcomes. The importance of immediate drug withdrawal in patients with SJS/TEN was highlighted in a 10-year observational study that suggested drug withdrawal reduced mortality by 30% for each day the drug was absent before the development of blisters and erosions. This observation did not hold true for drugs with prolonged half-lives."

All women receiving hormone therapy should also receive individualized breast cancer risk assessments.

Although most medications are tolerated throughout the perioperative period, there are some important exceptions. For example, the American College of Rheumatology recommends that biologic medications should be withheld as close to one dosing cycle as scheduling permits before elective hip and knee arthroplasty and restarted after evidence of wound healing, typically 14 days. Nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide) may be continued throughout the perioperative period. Methotrexate is administered once weekly, most commonly by oral or subcutaneous routes. Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have demonstrated that continuing DMARDs, including methotrexate, through the perioperative period is safe without an increase in infection rate (",

In surgeries with highest cardiovascular risk (major vascular, cardiothoracic), it is reasonable to start a statin preoperatively if the patient is not already taking one.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for adults aged 18 years or older who are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients at increased risk for CVD are identified by the USPSTF as patients with hypertension or elevated blood pressure; dyslipidemia; or mixed or multiple risk factors, such as the metabolic syndrome or an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk of 7.5% or higher. The USPSTF provides suggestions for behavioral change implementation, including a median of 12 contacts, with an estimated 6 hours of contact over 12 months; some one-on-one time with an interventionist; and use of motivational interviewing and behavioral change techniques, such as goal setting, active use of self-monitoring, and addressing barriers related to diet, physical activity, or weight change. The USPSTF suggests that counseling for behavioral change can be done in person or referred to outside counseling services, or patients can be informed about media-based interventions."

"). Screening for prostate cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk men has been controversial, and recommendations among professional organizations continue to evolve. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that for men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)–based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual decision. Before deciding whether to be screened, men should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision. Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men that is estimated to be a reduction in one prostate cancer–related death for every 1000 men screened for 10 years. However, many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of family history, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs. Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening."

Most patients also have frequent flushing in response to triggers, such as stress, alcohol consumption, heat, and excessive sunlight. The erythema of the cheeks can mimic the malar rash of systemic lupus erythematosus. Unlike lupus, however, the erythema of rosacea includes the nasolabial folds. Ocular rosacea may present in isolation or with associated skin findings. In ocular rosacea, the conjunctiva appears injected, and patients often describe a “gritty sensation.” In phymatous rosacea, severe sebaceous hyperplasia and chronic inflammation lead to fibrous overgrowth of the skin, creating a nodular, tumor-like deformation of the facial structures. Rhinophyma is the form most frequently encountered, and it is almost exclusively found in men. Treatment for rosacea is targeted toward the most prominent signs and symptoms in each patient. Topical metronidazole is a reasonable first-line option for patients with predominant papulopustular variant of rosacea as seen in this patient. Other effective topical agents include sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur, azelaic acid, topical calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and ivermectin. Oral antibiotics, such as low-dose doxycycline, have been shown to help control inflammation in ocular and papulopustular rosacea.

"). For this patient with an inability to lose weight despite pursuing healthy lifestyle choices, a thorough medication review is necessary to identify medications that may contribute to weight gain. Many medications are associated with weight gain, including some antidepressants, anticonvulsants, lithium, clozapine, olanzapine, depot progesterone, depot leuprolide acetate, glucocorticoids, and antiretroviral therapies. Medications used to treat diabetes mellitus have differing effects on weight. Sulfonylureas, insulin, thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), and meglitinides (repaglinide, nateglinide) typically cause weight gain, whereas glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (liraglutide, exenatide, albiglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin), and amylin mimetics (pramlintide) have been associated with weight loss. These agents produce weight loss by various mechanisms. GLP-1 receptor agonists and amylin mimetics slow gastric emptying and increase satiety. SGLT-2 inhibitors increase kidney excretion of glucose. In this patient's case, replacing glimepiride, a sulfonylurea, with liraglutide will result in weight loss."

Bupropion is the antidepressant medication most associated with weight loss and should be continued, especially because the patient's depression is currently well controlled. Among other antidepressants, venlafaxine, nefazodone, and fluoxetine are weight neutral. Paroxetine, however, has been associated with weight gain, as have citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, mirtazapine, and amitriptyline."

Many have a “fried egg” appearance, with an eccentric dark brown papular center and surrounding light brown ring. Dysplastic nevi can display one or more of the identifying characteristics of melanoma (asymmetry, irregular border, multiple colors, diameter >6 mm, evolution over time), making an accurate clinical diagnosis impossible; excisional skin biopsy to remove the entire lesion should be performed for diagnosis. The lesion seen on this patient shows minimal color variability, so the most likely diagnosis is a dysplastic nevus. Although the potential for an individual dysplastic nevus to develop into melanoma is low, patients with dysplastic nevi are at increased risk for developing a melanoma. Patients with multiple dysplastic nevi are also at risk for developing melanoma and should be monitored closely. Some of these patients have dysplastic nevus syndrome.

Postoperative pulmonary complications were defined as a composite of respiratory infection, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, atelectasis, or pneumothorax. Perioperative (either before or after surgery, or both) prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy showed an overall benefit (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93) in reducing the development of postoperative pulmonary complications. Other interventions associated with a reduced risk for postoperative pulmonary complications included lung-protective intraoperative ventilation, goal-directed hemodynamic therapies, epidural analgesia (replacing opioid analgesia), prophylactic mucolytics, and postoperative continuous positive pressure ventilation.

"). This patient has signs of skin atrophy, telangiectasias, and striae caused by overuse of clobetasol cream, a high-potency topical glucocorticoid. Side effects are most frequently seen when higher potencies are used for longer periods or when used under occlusion, and they can appear as soon as 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Use of glucocorticoids around the eyes can exacerbate glaucoma and cause cataracts. Skin atrophy is more likely to occur in intertriginous areas, the face, and often in the popliteal or antecubital fossa. Topical glucocorticoids may also cause easy bruising. Although this patient has signs of skin atrophy, she continues to have flares of her atopic dermatitis requiring treatment. Topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are immunomodulators (calcineurin inhibitors) that can be effective in treating atopic dermatitis, having similar efficacy to low- to medium-potency glucocorticoids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors can be used on the face and intertriginous areas without the risk for skin atrophy, telangiectasias, and striae that can occur with topical glucocorticoid use. The most common side effect of topical calcineurin inhibitors is stinging or burning after application. Both drugs have been associated with an increased risk for viral skin infections, such as herpes simplex and varicella zoster. These medications have a black box warning for the rare development of skin cancer and cutaneous lymphoma. Replacing clobetasol cream with tacrolimus ointment is the most appropriate choice to continue to treat this patient's atopic dermatitis in the setting of glucocorticoid atrophy."

Unhealthy alcohol use is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Individuals with unhealthy alcohol use often interact with the health care system but rarely receive appropriate treatment. Screening instruments to identify harmful drinking include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C), and Single Alcohol Screening Question (SASQ). The AUDIT is a validated 10-item screening test that takes approximately 2 to 3 minutes to administer; the AUDIT-C is a briefer (three-item) version of the AUDIT. With single-item screening, the clinician asks, “How many times in the past year have you had five [four for women and persons aged >65 years] or more drinks in 1 day?” Patients with a positive screening result should be evaluated for alcohol use disorder and medical complications of excessive alcohol intake."

Vaginal discharge can be physiologic, related to ovulation or pregnancy, or infectious, most commonly bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, or trichomoniasis. Other causes of vaginal discharge include irritation from use of douches, atrophic vaginitis, malignancy, or a foreign body. Physical examination includes assessment of the vulva and vagina for erythema, edema, excoriation, papillomas, and the type of discharge. However, clinical findings do not sufficiently distinguish among the common causes of vaginitis, and laboratory testing is necessary to establish a diagnosis. Diagnostic testing includes assessment of vaginal pH; amine (whiff) test; and microscopic evaluation of the specimen to look for clue cells on the wet mount and yeast, hyphae, and pseudohyphae on the KOH preparation. Occasionally, motile trichomonads can be visualized on a wet preparation, suggesting trichomoniasis; in these cases, antigen testing is recommended because it can be difficult to diagnose trichomoniasis on microscopy alone. If microscopy is unavailable, nucleic acid amplification testing for the common pathogens can assist with the diagnosis."

"). This patient likely has porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a photosensitive disorder that presents clinically with scarring and blistering on sun-exposed skin, most commonly the dorsal hands. Hyperpigmentation of the skin and hypertrichosis of the cheeks are also common. The photosensitivity is caused by excess porphyrins deposited in the skin that are sensitive to visible light, particularly the blue-light wavelength. PCT is the most common porphyria and typically presents in patients older than 40 years. Plasma and urine porphyrins should be measured to confirm the diagnosis of PCT to differentiate from pseudoporphyria, which presents similarly clinically but has normal plasma and urine porphyrin levels. Pseudoporphyria is commonly caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tetracyclines, and diuretics. Although skin biopsy can be performed, pathology can be nonspecific and is not necessary. PCT is most commonly associated with hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol-induced liver disease, and hemochromatosis. Testing for other susceptibility factors, such as HIV and hemochromatosis, should also be considered. Treatment for PCT is phlebotomy or twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine."

Although screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years may reduce the risk for breast cancer death, the number of deaths averted is smaller than that in older women and the number of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies is larger. In addition to false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies, all women undergoing regular screening mammography are at risk for the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to their health, or even apparent, during their lifetime (overdiagnosis). Beginning mammography screening at a younger age and screening more frequently may increase the risk for overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment. For patients younger than 50 years who are interested in screening, shared decision making is a reasonable strategy. Shared decision making includes consideration of the patient's level of risk, values, and preferences that will help inform the screening decision."

He has several risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), including an elevated BMI, hypertension, snoring, a large neck, and male sex. This clinical scenario is most consistent with OSA-related desaturations in the setting of supine positioning and somnolence due to recent anesthesia. OSA is exceedingly common in both men and women older than 50 years, and it remains undiagnosed in the majority of patients with the condition. Before surgery, all patients should be screened for OSA, which is associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, including cardiac events, pulmonary complications, and ICU admissions. A commonly used preoperative screening tool for OSA is the STOP-BANG score (1 point each for Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apneas, elevated blood Pressure, BMI >35, Age >50 years, Neck circumference >40 cm, and male Gender)."

About 6% of BCCs are pigmented, such as this one, which has dark brown pigment along the superior border of the tumor and a dot of pigment located at the middle of the inferior border. Pigmented BCCs are more common in patients with darker skin. Pigmented BCCs are a low-risk BCC subtype. However, they can mimic malignant melanoma, and biopsy is necessary to differentiate them. Although they have low mortality, significant local tissue destruction can occur if not treated. Mohs micrographic surgery is a surgical technique that enhances the ability to leave surgical margins free of tumor and at the same time minimize the resection of normal tissue. Compared with standard excision, Mohs micrographic surgery is associated with a reduced rate of tumor recurrence. Mohs micrographic surgery is usually reserved for skin cancers that have a high risk for recurrence or for tumors located in areas where minimal destruction of tissue is of cosmetic or functional importance. For the lesion on this patient's face near the eye, Mohs micrographic surgery would be recommended for the best chance of complete tumor eradication and cosmetic outcomes."
