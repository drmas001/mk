"). Of the four core features of this condition—parkinsonian motor features (particularly gait problems and slowness of movements), visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and frequent fluctuations in attention—this patient has three: parkinsonism, hallucinations, and attention fluctuations. The latter may manifest as acute confusional episodes in which the patient is less responsive than usual or as intermittent days with excessive daytime sleepiness. Additionally, this patient may also have REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out his dreams), but polysomnography is required to confirm this diagnosis. Clinical history and neurologic examination findings are critical for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies to avoid inappropriate treatment, particularly with antipsychotic drugs to which these patients are uniquely sensitive. Indicative biomarkers also have been developed to support the diagnosis when sufficient clinical history is lacking."

") is associated with hippocampal atrophy on MRI of the brain, and patients do not typically have associated parkinsonism (although this can happen in the later stages of disease). Distinguishing Alzheimer disease from dementia with Lewy bodies on the basis of cognition alone can be difficult, but other symptoms can help differentiate the two. REM sleep behavior disorder is much more common in dementia with Lewy bodies than Alzheimer disease. Delusions and hallucinations are common in dementia with Lewy bodies and frequently occur at the mild stages of disease. Additionally, significant sleep problems, especially daytime sleepiness, can be a debilitating feature of dementia with Lewy bodies. The fluctuations in Alzheimer disease can be described as days when memory is better or worse, whereas in dementia with Lewy bodies, the bad days involve decreased alertness."
