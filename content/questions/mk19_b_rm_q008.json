"). DISH is a noninflammatory condition that occasionally is associated with elevated inflammatory markers and causes calcification and ossification of spinal ligaments (especially the anterior longitudinal ligament) and entheses (tendon and ligament attachments to bone). This leads to pain and stiffness as well as reduced range of motion of the spine. DISH is more common in men aged 45 years and older and most often involves the thoracic spine. DISH does not affect the sacroiliac joints. This patient presents with classic epidemiologic features: he is an older man, he has typical symptoms and findings of DISH consisting of back pain and stiffness without sacroiliac pain, and his radiograph shows the distinctive finding of flowing linear calcification and ossification along the anterolateral aspects of the vertebral bodies ",

") is an inflammatory arthritis of the spine, usually presenting as chronic back pain and stiffness, typically before age 45 years. Radiographic findings include squaring of the vertebral bodies due to anterior and posterior inflammation, bone erosions, and formation of syndesmophytes, which are typically thin and vertically oriented and lead to ankylosis. Involvement of the sacroiliac joints is a hallmark of AS, and affected patients have elevated serum inflammatory markers. This patient does not have the clinical, radiographic, or laboratory findings characteristic of AS."
