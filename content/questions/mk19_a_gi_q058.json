"). The 2018 guidelines suggest that all adults should be screened for HCV with an HCV antibody test. In patients positive for HCV antibody, a positive HCV RNA result indicates active infection. Acute hepatitis C virus infection refers to the first 6 months after initial infection. Because there is a 20% to 50% chance that infection will spontaneously resolve during this period, monitoring HCV RNA for at least 12 to 16 weeks before starting treatment is often recommended. All patients with chronic HCV infection should be treated regardless of fibrosis stage, except those who have a short life expectancy, such as this patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Because this patient will not benefit from treatment, it is most appropriate to provide no further testing or treatment."

Although the physician needs to respect patient autonomy, this duty must be weighed against the potential harms of inappropriate interventions, possible secondary effects (e.g., antimicrobial resistance caused by inappropriate antibiotic prescribing), and responsible stewardship of medical resources. When there is no evidence that the desired diagnostic or therapeutic intervention will provide clinical benefit, physicians are not obligated to provide the service. Because this patient has a limited life expectancy, she should not be offered treatment for HCV."
