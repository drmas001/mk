"). This patient has ischemic heart disease and previously diagnosed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Amiodarone, dofetilide, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, and dronedarone may be used to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF. Antiarrhythmic drug selection is guided by the patient's comorbid conditions and safety considerations. Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic agent and, along with propafenone, is absolutely contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease, given the increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias in this population. This patient also has evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction on a post–myocardial infarction echocardiogram, which may be due to infarcted (as opposed to stunned) myocardium and may lead to increased long-term risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, his ECG shows widening of the QRS interval, which may reflect adverse effects of flecainide. This drug, therefore, is not safe in this patient; it should be discontinued and not restarted."

Aggressive β-blockade is warranted, given his recent myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and LV dysfunction. Furthermore, he will likely need metoprolol for rate control, if or when he reverts to AF."

Although exercise stress testing is sometimes used to assess the QRS duration during exercise in patients treated with class IC antiarrhythmic drugs, it will not change management in this patient. This patient already has QRS prolongation at rest and an absolute contraindication to flecainide because of his coronary artery disease."
