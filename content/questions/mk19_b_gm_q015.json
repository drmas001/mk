"). The basic elements in motivational interviewing include engagement, focusing, evoking, and planning. Motivational interviewing is a counseling approach that uses directive, patient-centered techniques. Its overall goal is to assist patients in addressing and changing unhealthy behaviors. Motivational interviewing capitalizes on the patient's intrinsic motivation to change and identifies reasons for ambivalence to change and discusses them without directly confronting the patient. Foundational to motivational interviewing is the physician's attempt to understand the patient's perspectives, followed by having the patient reflect on the need for change by highlighting the discrepancy between the patient's current and desired behavior. The physician attempts to build rapport and engage the patient with a supportive, nonjudgmental attitude. The physician elicits ideas and feelings about current behaviors and how they match the patient's desires and values, and has the patient reflect on the possibility of better options compared with current behaviors. The conversation allows identification of specific changes important to the patient. In a process known as change talk, the physician elicits the patient's own reasons and rationale for change. Motivational interviewing can be particularly effective in establishing a partnership to create lifestyle changes and may be highly relevant in this patient, who is currently not motivated to make lifestyle changes."
