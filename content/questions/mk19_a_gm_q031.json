"A 31-year-old man is evaluated for persistent difficulties at work related to intermittent flashbacks of a near-death experience during a tour of duty in Iraq years ago. These flashbacks occur without warning during the day and at night, with associated palpitations, diaphoresis, and severe anxiety. The unpredictable nature of the flashbacks has caused generalized anxiety throughout the day, difficulty with sleep initiation, and a desire to avoid being at work because he is afraid of his response to having a flashback in public. He does not drink alcohol."

") is the most appropriate drug treatment for this patient with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a disorder triggered by the experience of a traumatic event. The experience can be personal, through a loved one, or by repeated exposure to details or footage of such an event. Patients have intrusive memories of the event, such as nightmares and flashbacks, and avoid situations that remind them of the event. PTSD also causes functional impairment, hypervigilance, irritability, and sleep disturbance. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the cornerstone of therapy for patients with PTSD; it helps decrease PTSD-associated symptom burden and increase adaptive coping strategies. However, more than three quarters of patients with PTSD are also treated with pharmacologic therapies to relieve PTSD-related symptoms. Both sertraline and paroxetine are FDA approved for PTSD, and venlafaxine is commonly used as well. In this patient with significant generalized anxiety on most days, sertraline is an appropriate drug treatment."

") can be helpful in the short-term treatment of panic attacks, but it should not be used for long-term management. In addition, for patients in the early phases of PTSD, lorazepam can cause a paradoxical effect of increasing PTSD symptoms. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, also have significant potential for adverse effects, given the high rates of concomitant substance use and suicidality in PTSD."

") is increasingly recognized as a potential option for the treatment of PTSD and its associated symptom burden, and many statewide medical cannabis statutes list PTSD as a qualifying criterion for medical cannabis use. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the data evaluating cannabis as a therapeutic agent. In addition, variations in the types of products available from state to state and even within each state make it difficult to recommend medical cannabis as an initial therapeutic agent at this time."
