") is needed for this patient who does not have HIV infection. The CDC, American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend universal screening for HIV in all adults at least once. The fourth-generation HIV antigen/antibody combination assay, which evaluates for the presence of HIV antibodies and the p24 viral nucleic acid protein, is recommended for initial HIV testing. This patient's initial test was reactive, so further testing was indicated. The preferred follow-up testing for a positive result on an antigen/antibody combination assay includes an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay followed by HIV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) if the antibody differentiation assay finding is indeterminate or negative. HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay can identify the presence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies in the serum; HIV NAAT can detect viral RNA and is used to detect HIV RNA during the antibody-negative “window” period of acute HIV infection. Despite her initial positive test result, both follow-up test results were negative; the appropriate interpretation is that her initial positive result on the screening test was a false positive. Although the recommended initial screening test has a reported specificity of 99.6%, in persons at low risk with very low pretest probability, the rate of false-positive results may still be significant. This asymptomatic woman should be reassured that the initial test result was a false positive based on her negative results on follow-up testing."
