Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) manifests as large kidneys with multiple kidney cysts, and ultrasonography is the most common and least costly screening method. Ultrasonography criteria for diagnosing ADPKD are based on the number of visible cysts, the patient's age, and a family history of ADPKD."

", which encode for proteins that regulate differentiation and proliferation of renal tubular epithelial cells, account for approximately 85% and 15% of cases, respectively. More than 90% of mutations are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with spontaneous germline mutations accounting for the remaining cases. Early in the disease, there are generally no symptoms. Diagnosis is therefore often delayed in patients without a known family history of ADPKD. The first sign of ADPKD is often hypertension; other early signs and symptoms include hematuria (macroscopic or microscopic), pain or bloating in the back or abdomen, urinary tract infection, or kidney stones."
