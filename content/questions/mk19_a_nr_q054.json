"). Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction associated with antibodies to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. Onset most commonly occurs in the third decade of life in women and after age 50 years in men. Ptosis and diplopia are the first manifestations in two thirds of patients. Diagnosis is based on clinical, serologic, and EMG findings. In this patient with early-onset and active myasthenia gravis (<3 years' duration), thymectomy provides the best chance of avoiding or minimizing long-term immunotherapy. Indications for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis include the presence of thymoma and the need to minimize immunotherapy requirements in patients without thymoma who have active disease, have positivity for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, are younger than 65 years, and are within 3 years of diagnosis."
