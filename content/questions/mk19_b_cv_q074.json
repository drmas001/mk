If symptoms began 12 to 24 hours before presentation and/or there is hemodynamic instability, significant myocardium at risk (such as with anterior MI), or excessive bleeding risk, transfer for primary PCI (the preferred strategy) can be considered, although thrombolytic therapy should be considered if timely transfer (<120 minutes) is not available. Thrombolytic therapy is most effective within the first 3 to 6 hours from symptom onset. In addition to thrombolytic therapy, all patients without a specific contraindication should receive a loading dose of aspirin as well as intravenous unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, or fondaparinux. Clopidogrel loading (300 mg orally) has been demonstrated to increase rates of vessel patency and is also recommended in this setting."

"Thrombolytic therapy is widely available and is a reasonable therapeutic choice when primary PCI is delayed by more than 120 minutes. Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be most beneficial when incorporated into a pharmacoinvasive treatment protocol at non-PCI centers. This involves delivery of thrombolytic therapy early after symptom onset followed by transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for elective angiography and revascularization. Early routine transfer has shown benefit in allowing early “rescue” PCI for patients who do not demonstrate evidence of reperfusion or suffer reocclusion and reinfarction after delivery of thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolysis and admission to a telemetry bed (",
