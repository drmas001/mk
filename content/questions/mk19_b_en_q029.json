"). In addition to gynecomastia (evidenced by palpation of subareolar glandular tissue >0.5 cm in diameter), this patient displays clinical features of hypogonadism, including fatigue, low libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility, and decreased muscle mass. A morning testosterone test is the next step to confirm that hypogonadism is the etiology of his gynecomastia. In addition to hypogonadism, gynecomastia may be caused by substance use disorders, malnutrition, cirrhosis, testicular germ cell tumors, hyperthyroidism, and chronic kidney disease. Gynecomastia also may result from the use of medications that affect androgen or estrogen levels, such as spironolactone, cimetidine, ketoconazole, estrogens, antiandrogens, 5Î±-reductase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors, as well as over-the-counter supplements, such as lavender oil and tea tree oil. A thorough medication/supplement history should be taken in all patients with gynecomastia. When the etiology of gynecomastia is not clinically apparent, the initial laboratory evaluation includes measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and 8 ",
