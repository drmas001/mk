"A 71-year-old man arrives for pretravel consultation. He is leaving in 3 weeks for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and plans to spend 10 days there. Medical history is significant for chronic myeloid leukemia, for which he underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 2 months ago. His posttransplant course has been without infection or complications. He is up to date on routine recommended vaccinations. Pretransplant screening showed immunity to varicella-zoster virus and hepatitis B but not to hepatitis A. Medications are prednisone, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, acyclovir, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."

"). Depending on the level of immune suppression, travel itinerary, and trip duration, immunocompromised travelers are at greater risk of disease acquisition and more severe illness. Recommended and required vaccinations must be individualized for each traveler's immune status. Live vaccines are contraindicated in persons with significant immune compromise, either from disease or immunosuppressive medication. Regardless of immune status, all susceptible persons can safely receive the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine, which should be administered as early as possible before travel to countries with intermediate to high hepatitis A endemicity. Immunization with either the multidose live-attenuated oral typhoid or the single-dose intramuscular capsular polysaccharide typhoid vaccine provides similar protection; however, the capsular polysaccharide vaccine is more appropriate in this immunosuppressed transplant recipient."
