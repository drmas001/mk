She has had no improvement in abdominal pain despite a diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) and treatment with rifaximin, eluxadoline, alosetron, and loperamide."

"). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, with a prevalence of 10% to 15% in the general U.S. population. The Rome IV criteria for diagnosis of IBS require symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain at least 1 day per week for a period of 3 months, along with at least two of the following three criteria: pain related to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool consistency. Although multiple supplements and prescription medications have been used to treat IBS, the body of evidence in favor of some of those treatments is, at best, modest. Patients with IBS-D may benefit from dietary restrictions, including a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet. Prescription medications with FDA approval for treatment of IBS-D include rifaximin, eluxadoline, and alosetron. Other medications with clinical evidence for the treatment of IBS-D include loperamide, antispasmodics, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). This patient has tried all the aforementioned interventions except for a TCA. Based on data from several randomized trials, TCAs offer modest relief of the abdominal pain and global symptoms of IBS-D. The American Gastroenterological Association has given a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence for the use of TCAs in the treatment of IBS-D."
