"). This patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II symptoms, as evidenced by dyspnea with moderate exertion, is stable and has no evidence of volume overload on examination. In the PARADIGM-HF trial of patients with symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, valsartan-sacubitril reduced mortality and heart failure hospitalization by 20% compared with enalapril. Based on this study, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure guidelines recommend replacing an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with valsartan-sacubitril in patients with chronic symptomatic HFrEF. In addition, for patients with new-onset heart failure, directly initiating valsartan-sacubitril, rather than a pretreatment period with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, is a safe and effective strategy in patients with HFrEF. Because of the risk for angioedema, ACE inhibitors (but not ARBs) should be discontinued at least 36 hours before starting valsartan-sacubitril."

") reduces the risk for hospitalization for heart failure but does not affect mortality. Digoxin toxicity is common, and risk is increased in patients with abnormal renal function, as is the case with this patient. It may be helpful in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who have concomitant atrial fibrillation, to aid in rate control. Valsartan-sacubitril is a better option in this patient without atrial fibrillation and with abnormal renal function."
