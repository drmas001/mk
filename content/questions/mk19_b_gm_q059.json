"). Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged 6 months or older. The influenza vaccine should be administered as soon as it becomes available, preferably by October, but can be given at any time during the influenza season. Immunocompromised patients, including patients with cancer and those undergoing chemotherapy, are at risk for influenza and may be more likely to develop complications. Successful immunization requires a competent immune system to generate antibodies; although this response may be attenuated in immunocompromised patients, vaccination is still indicated. Members of this patient's immediate household should also receive the inactivated influenza vaccine. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, the vaccine should ideally be administered at least 2 weeks before initiation of chemotherapy or 1 week after administration of chemotherapy if between cycles. However, some studies have shown no difference in immunogenic response at different time points during chemotherapeutic cycles."
