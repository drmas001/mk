"). The first step in pleural fluid analysis is to assess the appearance of the pleural fluid. The next step is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or exudate. Transudates are due to an imbalance between hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, as occurs with heart failure and cirrhosis, the two most common causes. Exudates are due to inflammation causing increased capillary permeability, impaired drainage by lymphatics, or both. There are many causes of exudative effusions, but the most common are infection and malignancy. Differentiation is commonly made using the Light criteria. These criteria are very sensitive for exudates; however, they are less specific, and approximately 25% of transudates are misclassified as exudates. Light criteria define an exudative effusion by the presence of any one of the following findings: pleural fluid to serum protein ratio greater than 0.5, a pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to serum LDH ratio greater than 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH more than two thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH. This patient's pleural fluid is consistent with a transudative process. Pleural fluid differentiation into an exudative category by at least one of the Light criteria is nearly 100% sensitive but less specific. Specificity further declines when a transudative process is treated with diuretic therapy, as may be the case in a patient in whom heart failure remains the most likely posttest diagnosis. Pleural fluid cholesterol level greater than 55 mg/dL is a less sensitive indicator of exudative effusion than the Light criteria, but it is more specific and would increase posttest probability of an exudate. A difference of less than 1.2 g/dL between serum and pleural fluid albumin levels is also more specific for an exudate than the Light criteria. For other patients in whom an exudative effusion is not clinically suspected but is suggested by the Light criteria, further testing may be necessary."
