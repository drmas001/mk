"). For this patient with an inability to lose weight despite pursuing healthy lifestyle choices, a thorough medication review is necessary to identify medications that may contribute to weight gain. Many medications are associated with weight gain, including some antidepressants, anticonvulsants, lithium, clozapine, olanzapine, depot progesterone, depot leuprolide acetate, glucocorticoids, and antiretroviral therapies. Medications used to treat diabetes mellitus have differing effects on weight. Sulfonylureas, insulin, thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), and meglitinides (repaglinide, nateglinide) typically cause weight gain, whereas glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (liraglutide, exenatide, albiglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin), and amylin mimetics (pramlintide) have been associated with weight loss. These agents produce weight loss by various mechanisms. GLP-1 receptor agonists and amylin mimetics slow gastric emptying and increase satiety. SGLT-2 inhibitors increase kidney excretion of glucose. In this patient's case, replacing glimepiride, a sulfonylurea, with liraglutide will result in weight loss."

") will not result in weight loss. Bupropion is the antidepressant medication most associated with weight loss and should be continued, especially because the patient's depression is currently well controlled. Among other antidepressants, venlafaxine, nefazodone, and fluoxetine are weight neutral. Paroxetine, however, has been associated with weight gain, as have citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, mirtazapine, and amitriptyline."

") will not be as effective in reducing weight as switching to liraglutide. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, is weight neutral and unlikely to result in significant weight loss. Saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin are other drugs within this class. Other pharmacologic agents for diabetes that are weight neutral include metformin and the Î±-glucosidases (acarbose, miglitol)."

"), a medication that does not promote weight gain, and thus her antiseizure regimen should not be changed. Many other anticonvulsant medications, including carbamazepine, valproate, and gabapentin, are associated with weight gain, whereas topiramate and zonisamide typically cause weight loss. Phenytoin is weight neutral."
