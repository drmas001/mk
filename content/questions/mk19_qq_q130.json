"). Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart failure in the United States (>50% of patients) and should be considered in all patients with newly diagnosed heart failure. The decision to evaluate for CAD depends on the patient's symptoms and risk factors (family history, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, tobacco use). Additionally, findings on ECG and echocardiography may suggest an ischemic cause for left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with exertional chest pain, history of myocardial infarction, or other symptoms suggesting CAD should undergo further evaluation with stress testing or cardiac catheterization as clinically appropriate. Identification of significant CAD is important, as left ventricular dysfunction caused by ischemia may improve or resolve with percutaneous or surgical revascularization. This patient has a high likelihood for ischemic heart disease as evidenced by a previous inferior wall myocardial infarction on ECG, which likely accounts for her symptoms and reduced ejection fraction. Given the high pretest probability of ischemic heart disease and findings suggestive of extensive myocardial ischemia, coronary angiography is indicated in this patient."

Otherwise, endomyocardial biopsy is useful in only a limited number of patients who may have heart failure secondary to giant cell myocarditis, restrictive and infiltrative cardiomyopathies, or other types of myocarditis. Clinical situations where biopsy might be considered include unexplained acute onset and fulminant heart failure associated with normal size or dilated left ventricle; in patients with dilated left ventricle, new ventricular arrhythmias, or conduction block; and in patients who fail to respond to guideline-directed medical therapy. This patient has risk factors for CAD, and endomyocardial biopsy is not indicated."
