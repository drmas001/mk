The patient reports associated neck stiffness, intermittent visual blurring without diplopia, and nocturnal pulsatile tinnitus. She has had no other symptoms. She also has a history of acne and vitamin D deficiency. Medications are topical benzoyl peroxide, oral doxycycline, and vitamin D."

"). The patient's history and examination findings are classic for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Increased intracranial pressure in the absence of any vascular or space-occupying lesion is the hallmark of IIH (also known as pseudotumor cerebri). Headaches, visual symptoms, and intracranial noises (pulsatile tinnitus) are the most common presenting symptoms of IIH. Head pain is nonspecific, and neck pain is common. Vision may be blurred or periodically dim in brief episodes known as visual obscurations. Findings on neurologic examination include papilledema and occasionally ophthalmoplegia, typically sixth nerve palsy. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI may reveal widening of the optic nerve sheaths, an empty sella, or flattening of the posterior optic globes. Magnetic resonance venography may reveal unilateral or bilateral stenoses of the intracranial transverse sinuses or may have normal results. Approximately 90% of persons with IIH are women of childbearing age with an elevated BMI. IIH has been associated with kidney failure, endocrine disorders, and the use of tetracyclines, retinoic acid, and progesterone or estrogen supplements. Discontinuation of any potential offending agent is the first step in management."
