"A 26-year-old woman is evaluated for a 3-month history of increasing left hip pain that is worse with prolonged standing. Systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed 5 years ago, characterized by small joint arthralgia, malar rash, cytopenias, and Raynaud phenomenon. At diagnosis she required high-dose prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and azathioprine therapy. Prednisone dosage was tapered over 6 months. Periodic flares have been treated with increased dosages of prednisone. Current medications are hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and low-dose prednisone."

"). Isolated new pain in the hip is an uncommon manifestation of a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flare. A serious complication of SLE is osteonecrosis, which most commonly affects the hips but can also involve other large joints, and should be suspected when there is otherwise unexplained pain and/or reduced range of motion in a single joint. Long-term and high prednisone dosages (>20 mg/d), severe/active SLE, and vasculitis are all associated with increased risk. In patients with osteonecrosis, the plain radiograph can remain normal for months after symptoms begin. MRI is the modality of choice for sensitive evaluation of early disease, with plain radiography useful to diagnose and monitor later stages. Small lesions can improve and resolve spontaneously, but larger lesions usually lead to bony collapse and structural sequelae. New hip pain in patients with a history of SLE should prompt evaluation for osteonecrosis with MRI."
