" descents. The height of the waveform does not fall or may increase during inspiration (Kussmaul sign), reflecting the fixed diastolic volume of the right heart. Early diastolic filling is unimpaired or even accentuated and is followed by sudden cessation when total acceptable volume is met, resulting in a high-frequency early diastolic sound (pericardial knock, heard in <50% of patients). Pulsus paradoxus is less frequent (<20% of patients) in constrictive pericarditis than in cardiac tamponade. Peripheral edema, ascites, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusions are common. Diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is made with imaging studies and hemodynamic evaluation. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals normal right and left ventricular size and systolic function despite prominent symptoms and findings suggestive of heart failure. Dilatation of the inferior vena cava reflects elevated right-sided filling (right atrial) pressure. Doppler echocardiography and tissue Doppler velocity are required to differentiate constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Although an underlying cause of constrictive pericarditis is not always identified, previous pericarditis, cardiac surgery, chest irradiation, connective tissue disorders, and uremia are common precipitants."
