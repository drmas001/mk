"). When cervical cancer screening is performed by screening for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) with HPV genotyping, a positive result for HPV genotype 16 or 18 should be managed by immediate referral for colposcopy with biopsy. Genotypes 16 and 18 confer high current and future risk for cervical cancer. Therefore, detection of either HPV genotype requires referral for colposcopy testing no matter the results of prior or concurrent cytology. Colposcopy provides an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix, vagina, and vulva and enhances the ability to detect premalignant and malignant lesions that can biopsied. This 36-year-old woman has completed appropriate cervical cancer screening by having high-risk HPV screening. Her screening test results are positive, with detection of HPV genotype 16, so immediate colposcopy referral is indicated."
