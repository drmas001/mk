") to evaluate for white coat hypertension. White coat hypertension, also termed isolated clinic or office hypertension, refers to elevated blood pressure (BP) measured in the office, but normal out-of-office BP averages. According to guideline recommendations, in adults with untreated systolic BP >130 mm Hg but <160 mm Hg or diastolic BP >80 mm Hg but <100 mm Hg, it is reasonable to screen for white coat hypertension using either ABPM or home BP monitoring measurements obtained by the patient. Before white coat hypertension is diagnosed, the reliability of out-of-office measurements must be confirmed; for example, the patient's home BP monitor should be calibrated against the office sphygmomanometer or, preferably, BP should be measured by an ABPM device. In patients with white coat hypertension, annual follow-up with out-of-office BP measurements should be considered to determine if conversion to sustained hypertension has occurred."

Routine testing for renovascular disease may not change management for patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease, because data suggest that medical therapy may be as beneficial as invasive procedures. However, in young patients with resistant hypertension and a high clinical suspicion for fibromuscular dysplasia (e.g., sudden onset of resistant hypertension at a young age, presence of an abdominal bruit), renal artery imaging may be considered.
