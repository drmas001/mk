"). Anorexia, weight loss, and cachexia are common in advanced malignancy. Assuming potentially reversible conditions (nausea, altered taste, medication side effects, bowel obstruction, dysphagia, psychological comorbidities) have been excluded, disease-related cachexia is caused by an altered neurohormonal, inflammatory milieu that results in profound alterations in metabolism. These changes lead to decreased appetite and increased catabolism, which cause progressive weight loss. Patients often feel compelled to eat (despite discomfort) to ease distress experienced by family members and caregivers. Cachexia cannot be significantly reversed by more aggressive or invasive methods of nutritional support, including enteral (or parenteral) nutrition, and these interventions in the context of cachexia of advanced disease do not improve morbidity or mortality. Educating patients and families on the causes and pathophysiology of cachexia may help them better understand and accept the expected course of the disease and should ideally occur before anorexia and weight loss develop. Patients and families may benefit by shifting focus to social pleasures derived from eating even small quantities; maintaining quality of life should be the goal instead of gaining weight."
