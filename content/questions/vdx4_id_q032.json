It is commonly associated with pustular or vesiculopustular skin lesions (but macules, papules, and bullae are also possible), which are typically found on the distal extremities. The rash is often painless and may only last a few days. These lesions are typically associated with tenosynovitis and polyarthralgia and often are associated with systemic signs, such as fever."
