The right testis is elevated, and the overlying scrotal skin is erythematous and warm. The epididymis cannot be distinguished from the testis owing to severe scrotal swelling and pain. Cremasteric reflex is absent on the right and intact on the left."

"). This patient has a classic presentation of testicular torsion, a twisting of the spermatic cord contents resulting in testicular ischemia. Testicular torsion is most common in children and young adults and presents as acute unilateral scrotal pain and swelling. Examination reveals elevation of the involved scrotum and an absent cremasteric reflex (failure of the testis to elevate when the ipsilateral inner thigh is stroked). Decreased blood flow seen on Doppler ultrasound is typical. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, and this patient should undergo immediate surgical exploration. The time from symptom onset to surgical exploration is the most important determining factor of testicular viability. If surgical exploration is performed within 6 hours of symptom onset, the testis remains viable in 90% to 100% of cases. Testicular viability drops to 50% if surgery is not performed until 12 hours after presentation and to less than 10% if performed 24 hours or more after presentation. If surgery is not readily available, an attempt to untwist the testicle manually is warranted. Even if successful, follow-up surgery is typically required."

") is highly sensitive (89%) and highly specific (99%) and has a false-negative rate of approximately 1% for diagnosing testicular torsion, it is not mandatory or necessary in patients with a supportive history and unequivocal physical examination findings, as exemplified by this patient. Scrotal ultrasonography is of most value when the diagnosis is in doubt owing to equivocal physical examination findings."
