"). Patients with reduced ejection fraction due to ischemic cardiomyopathy are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death. Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated for patients with ischemic heart disease and reduced ejection fraction 40 or more days after acute myocardial infarction and 90 or more days after revascularization, while on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Because this patient underwent primary revascularization for acute myocardial infarction, she should be treated with optimal medical therapy, and repeat echocardiography should be performed after 90 days to reassess ejection fraction. Reduced ejection fraction immediately following myocardial infarction may be related to myocardial stunning and can improve over the next few months, especially with GDMT."

"), are the primary diuretic option for treating patients with heart failure who have volume overload. Furosemide is the most commonly used loop diuretic, although torsemide and bumetanide may be more effective owing to longer half-lives and increased bioavailability. Diuretic therapy may be complicated by electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. In patients who are asymptomatic and without evidence of volume overload, such as this one, diuretic therapy is unnecessary."

"Arrhythmias are a common cause of death in patients with heart failure, and ICDs improve survival when used for both primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Current guidelines recommend ICD placement in patients receiving GDMT who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less and New York Heart Association functional class II or III heart failure symptoms. It is important to reassess both left ventricular ejection fraction and symptoms after GDMT (40 days after myocardial infarction, 3 months in all others, including following revascularization). Many patients with new-onset heart failure experience substantial improvements in ejection fraction with medical therapy and may not require or benefit from ICD placement (",
