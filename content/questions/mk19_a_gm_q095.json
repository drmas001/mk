He experiences disequilibrium intermittently. MRI of the brain performed 6 months ago was normal. The patient is otherwise healthy and takes no medications."

"). The onset of Meniere disease typically occurs between ages 20 and 40 years. Diagnosis requires two or more episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours and fluctuating or nonfluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear pressure; the hearing loss often begins years before the vertigo. Meniere disease causes a peripheral vertigo, and nystagmus is present during episodes of vertigo. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver does not always induce vertigo or nystagmus. HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew) examination results will be consistent with a peripheral cause of vertigo: catch-up saccades, unidirectional nystagmus, and absence of vertical skew."

The absence of catch-up saccades, presence of direction-changing nystagmus, or presence of skew deviation on the HINTS examination is suggestive of a central cause of vertigo. Vertebrobasilar stroke typically occurs in patients with risk factors for vascular disease and would be visualized on MRI, effectively ruling out the diagnosis in this patient."
