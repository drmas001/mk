"). The patient has rheumatoid arthritis, and methotrexate is considered the first-line treatment of a patient with a new diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate can be used alone for rheumatoid arthritis, and the dose can be titrated up over a period of weeks, with periodic assessment of the clinical response and laboratory measures of systemic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and monitoring for medication toxicity. Contraceptive use in women of child-bearing age is recommended because methotrexate can be associated with pregnancy loss and fetal abnormalities. If methotrexate alone is inadequate after a trial for an appropriate length of time, it can also be used in combination with additional disease-modifying agents, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, tofacitinib, and rituximab."

NSAIDs may be used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis to relieve symptoms. However, they would not be expected to alter the natural history of the disease or prevent permanent deformities or radiographic damage. NSAID use with glucocorticoids should be avoided, and caution should be exercised with concomitant methotrexate."

Rituximab is indicated for treatment of patients who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate alone or in whom multiple other agents have failed. Rituximab is given via intravenous administration of two doses 2 weeks apart every 6 months. Thus, the time frame over which it would be expected to work in rheumatoid arthritis would be inappropriate for a patient with new-onset disease who has not yet been treated with methotrexate."
