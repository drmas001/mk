" inhibition combined with early invasive angiography within 24 hours of presentation in hemodynamically stable patients who have evidence of NSTE-ACS and elevated risk as determined by prognostic assessment with risk scores, such as TIMI and GRACE risk models. Clopidogrel or ticagrelor is indicated at presentation in patients with acute coronary syndrome managed with an early invasive strategy (class 1 recommendation). Ticagrelor (180 mg at presentation followed by 90 mg twice daily) is more effective than clopidogrel (300-600 mg at presentation followed by 75 mg/d) and preferred in patients without increased bleeding risk. However, ticagrelor is associated with higher rates of bleeding than clopidogrel and is associated with an increased incidence of dyspnea and bradycardia. This patient has oxygen-dependent COPD, which may limit her ability to tolerate ticagrelor therapy. Therefore, clopidogrel is the most reasonable option for this patient."
