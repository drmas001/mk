The usual presentation of actinic keratosis is a poorly defined, erythematous, scaly “sandpaper” macule that typically occurs on sun-exposed areas (e.g., face, dorsal arms, hands, legs, and upper back) of older persons with fair skin. Approximately 1% to 5% of actinic keratoses will develop into squamous cell cancers. This patient has extensive involvement, with a large number of lesions. Extensive actinic keratoses require “field therapy” to adequately treat the extensive precancerous lesions. When there are more than 10 (to 15) lesions, targeted specific lesion destruction is often inadequate, so it is preferable to treat the entire affected area. This can be achieved with topical chemotherapy creams, such as fluorouracil, imiquimod, or ingenol mebutate; however, a randomized clinical trial demonstrated that fluorouracil is the most effective treatment. Topical fluorouracil is applied once or twice daily and causes erythema, blistering, and necrosis with erosion, followed by re-epithelialization. The process may take from 4 to 6 weeks. The prevention of additional actinic keratoses with sun avoidance and sun protection is an important therapeutic principle. Use of fluorouracil cream can reduce the number of new actinic keratoses that develop over the subsequent 6 to 24 months and reduce rates of new lesion growth, need for targeted lesion-specific treatment, and number of lesions overall."

Symptoms are often worse at night and with repetitive wrist motion. Risk factors include obesity, female sex, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and connective tissue disorders. Although keyboard use has been suggested as a risk factor, it has not been confirmed by studies. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome who have active denervation on nerve conduction studies and have muscle weakness and atrophy on clinical examination should undergo decompression surgery to prevent irreversible motor weakness.

A loud succussion splash is associated with retained air and gastric fluid. It is auscultated with the stethoscope over the upper abdomen when the patient is rocked or the abdomen is palpated. Delayed gastric emptying can be due to either a mechanical gastric outlet obstruction or gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a neuromuscular disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It is most commonly idiopathic, but other common causes are diabetes, drugs, and surgery. In this patient, the use of ibuprofen could have caused peptic ulceration with outlet obstruction due to inflammation and/or scarring. In all patients, the initial diagnostic test is upper endoscopy to exclude gastric outlet obstruction. Once a structural cause for symptoms has been excluded, a test to assess gastric emptying (such as gastric scintigraphy, wireless motility capsule, or radiolabeled carbon breath test) is performed.

Highly emetogenic chemotherapy is associated with greater than 90% risk of emesis if appropriate prophylactic medications are not given. High-dose cisplatin is highly emetogenic. Serotonin antagonists like ondansetron or palonosetron are very effective in preventing acute nausea and vomiting but have less impact on prevention of delayed-onset symptoms.

"). Chronic infections (tuberculosis or osteomyelitis, malignancies, and collagen vascular diseases) are usually associated with anemia of inflammation. Pathogenesis of anemia of inflammation is multifactorial, likely resulting from enhanced immune response. Inflammation leads to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, which lead to altered erythropoietin production and responsiveness. Increased production of peptide hepcidin by the liver causes decreased iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and decreased iron release by macrophages, resulting in a state of iron-restricted hematopoiesis. No laboratory test is commercially available for measuring hepcidin levels. Peripheral blood smear may be normal in patients with anemia of inflammation or, over time, may show microcytic hypochromic erythrocytes, such as in iron deficiency. Typically, anemia of inflammation is characterized by a hemoglobin level greater than 8 g/dL (80 g/L). Because of erythrocyte underproduction, reticulocyte count is typically low for the degree of anemia. Serum iron level is initially normal but decreases over time. Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is low, and serum ferritin level is typically elevated."

Common systemic causes are thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorders, and use of anticoagulants (including antiplatelet therapy).

It affects all the tissues of the joint and is characterized by cartilage and meniscal degradation, subchondral bone changes (bone marrow lesions, subchondral sclerosis), and osteophyte formation. This patient's knee pain suggests tibiofemoral knee OA, a diagnosis supported by the presence of medial joint-line tenderness and radiographic findings of medial tibiofemoral compartment joint-space narrowing. The strongest risk factors for OA are advancing age, obesity, female sex, joint injury (caused by occupation, repetitive use, or actual trauma), and genetic factors. Obesity, in particular, is the most important modifiable risk factor for knee OA. Several trials have demonstrated that weight loss and/or exercise programs can relieve pain and improve function, similar to the benefits of NSAID use. In long-term studies, sustained weight loss of approximately 6.8 kg (15 lb) has relieved symptoms. The 2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline for the management of OA strongly recommends exercise and weight loss for knee OA. Other strongly recommended therapies for knee OA include self-management programs, tai chi, use of a cane or a tibiofemoral knee brace, oral and topical NSAIDs, and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection."

"). Portal venous hypertension develops in the setting of advanced cirrhosis due to obstruction of blood flow caused by intrahepatic fibrosis, the development of regenerating liver nodules, and increased intrahepatic vascular resistance. Hypersplenism, often also associated with thrombocytopenia, further increases flow within the portal vein, exacerbating portal hypertension. Complications of portal hypertension include gastroesophageal varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Esophageal varices are enlarged vessels within the lumen of the lower esophagus that provide extrahepatic pathways of blood flow from the portal circulation to the systemic circulation. Over time, esophageal varices enlarge and may spontaneously rupture, leading to bleeding and possible death. Upper endoscopy should be performed on all patients with cirrhosis to assess for the presence of varices. Management of varices in patients with cirrhosis depends on the size of the varix and whether the cirrhosis is compensated. Although patients in the early stages of cirrhosis may be asymptomatic, metabolic encephalopathy and portal hypertension leading to ascites and gastroesophageal variceal disease indicate decompensated cirrhosis and a poor prognosis."

Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin for 7 days or levofloxacin for 5 days for uncomplicated infections, 10-14 days in complicated infections) are the only oral agents recommended for empiric outpatient treatment (except in pregnancy) because of the higher urine drug concentrations achieved compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Patients with pyelonephritis who are acutely ill, hypotensive, nauseated, or vomiting should be hospitalized to receive intravenous fluids and parenteral antibiotics. Empiric therapy for hospitalized patients is begun with a fluoroquinolone, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin or penicillin, or an aminoglycoside, and treatment is continued for 7 to 14 days with adjustments to the antibiotic regimen based on results of urine and blood cultures. Therapy can be completed with active oral agents if an adequate clinical response has been observed. Patients with bacteremia do not require longer treatment courses and may be converted to appropriate oral therapy when clinically stable. Persistent fever and unilateral flank pain despite adequate treatment suggest perinephric or intrarenal abscess and the need for imaging with kidney CT."

Neurally mediated syncope includes vasovagal syncope, which may be provoked by noxious stimuli, fear, stress, or heat overexposure; situational syncope, which is triggered by cough, micturition, defecation, or deglutition; and carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is sometimes experienced during head rotation, shaving, or use of a tight-fitting neck collar.

All patients with syncope should undergo ECG, but patients with uncomplicated vasovagal syncope do not require further investigation or specialist referral. This patient's bradycardia is likely a result of the vasovagal physiology, which can cause peripheral vasodilation, bradycardia, or both.

Evidence from the COMPASS trial demonstrated that aspirin (100 mg/d) plus low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) was associated with improved major adverse cardiovascular and limb end points when compared with aspirin plus placebo in patients with coronary artery disease and PAD. Major bleeding, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding, was increased in patients assigned to receive aspirin plus rivaroxaban; however, fatal or critical organ bleeding was not significantly different between the groups."

This patient's initial test was reactive, so further testing was indicated. The preferred follow-up testing for a positive result on an antigen/antibody combination assay includes an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay followed by HIV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) if the antibody differentiation assay finding is indeterminate or negative. HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay can identify the presence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies in the serum; HIV NAAT can detect viral RNA and is used to detect HIV RNA during the antibody-negative “window” period of acute HIV infection. Despite her initial positive test result, both follow-up test results were negative; the appropriate interpretation is that her initial positive result on the screening test was a false positive. Although the recommended initial screening test has a reported specificity of 99.6%, in persons at low risk with very low pretest probability, the rate of false-positive results may still be significant.

"). The Rome IV criteria for diagnosis of IBS require symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain at least 1 day per week for a period of 3 months, along with at least two of the following three criteria: pain related to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool consistency. IBS can then be further subtyped as IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C), IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M), or IBS unclassified. In IBS-C, more than 25% of the stools are hard and less than 25% are loose. IBS is more common in women, particularly those younger than 50 years. Alarm symptoms, including weight loss, fever, bloody stools, and family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, are indications for additional evaluation. In contrast, low-risk patients with a diagnosis established by the aforementioned criteria do not benefit from extensive laboratory or endoscopic investigations. Patients with IBS-C are often initially advised to use psyllium (soluble fiber) and avoid dietary FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). If constipation persists, polyethylene glycol often is used. Lubiprostone, plecanatide, or linaclotide may subsequently be recommended for refractory constipation. Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, is a prosecretory agent strongly recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association for the treatment of IBS-C based on high-quality evidence."

After invasion, lentigo maligna is called lentigo maligna melanoma and is distinguishable from benign processes by positive ABCDE criteria."

Approximately 40% to 45% of the calcium in serum is bound to protein, principally albumin, although the physiologically active form of calcium is in an ionized (or free) state. In most patients with relatively normal serum albumin levels, the total calcium usually reflects an accurate ionized calcium fraction. However, in clinical settings in which increased protein binding of calcium may occur, the serum total calcium level may be elevated without a rise in the actual serum ionized calcium concentration. This may occur in patients with hyperalbuminuria (as may occur in those who are severely dehydrated) and in patients with a paraprotein capable of binding calcium (as occasionally occurs in some patients with multiple myeloma). This phenomenon is sometimes termed pseudohypercalcemia (or factitious hypercalcemia). If present, a normal ionized calcium level may indicate that the elevated total calcium level is the result of excessive protein binding and potentially eliminates the need for further evaluation for hypercalcemia. Ionized calcium measurement is indicated in asymptomatic patients with multiple myeloma and elevated total serum calcium."

This patient was appropriately initially treated with tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is the most common cause of LUTS in men. However, the persistence of symptoms, absence of bladder outlet obstruction on urodynamic studies and bladder ultrasonography, and presence of irritative symptoms points to overactive bladder as the diagnosis. Medical treatment is aimed at reducing involuntary detrusor contractions during filling of the bladder. Because no evidence of postvoid residuals was found, it is safe to initiate a trial of an anticholinergic medication, such as tolterodine, in this patient. The combination of the α-blocker (such as tamsulosin) and an anticholinergic agent (such as tolterodine) is more effective in treating LUTS than monotherapy with either drug."

AR is generally asymptomatic for a long time (possibly decades) until signs and symptoms of heart failure develop due to cardiac remodeling from chronic volume overload. Angina also may manifest because of subendocardial ischemia related to increased wall tension or reduced coronary perfusion pressure from reduced diastolic pressures.

Ulcerative colitis is an immune-mediated disease with a fluctuating course that is characterized by periods of remission and flare-ups of varying severity and extent of colonic involvement. Most patients have proctitis, but inflammatory changes often extend proximally in a continuous fashion and involve other segments of the colon. The presence of systemic symptoms, such as fever and tachycardia, as well as 6 to 10 daily bloody bowel movements, defines a severe flare. Because some of the symptoms of ",

In addition to the clinical assessment, fecal calprotectin, a protein found in neutrophils, is useful in assessing disease activity and response to treatment. Glucocorticoids are appropriate for the treatment of severe flares of ulcerative colitis but should never be used for maintenance therapy. TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, golimumab, and infliximab) are effective for induction and maintenance in severe ulcerative colitis and may lead to a favorable response within days. Although well tolerated, TNF inhibitors increase the risk for infection."

Clinical signs of tamponade include tachycardia, hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and elevation of the jugular venous pulse.

The ECG may demonstrate electrical alternans (related to a swinging motion of the heart within the pericardial fluid) or low voltage.

"). Lateral elbow tendinopathy (previously called lateral epicondylitis), or tennis elbow, is induced by repetitive wrist extension (e.g., prolonged computer use, racquet sports). Symptoms also can be caused by excessive strain on the wrist extensor tendons, as can happen with lifting or carrying a heavy object. Pain is located over the lateral elbow but may also radiate to the dorsal forearm. Tenderness over the lateral elbow and pain with resisted wrist extension are characteristic examination findings. Increasing evidence suggests elbow tendinopathy is a chronic tendinosis with disorganization and neovascularization of the tissues, instead of an acute or chronic inflammatory process as traditionally believed. Because the primary mechanism of injury appears to be mechanical strain, and repetitive use of injured tissues diminishes healing, primary treatment is avoidance of activities that cause pain and continued injury to the affected area. Braces may be useful when exacerbating activities cannot be avoided, and counterforce bracing, which alters the mechanical strain on the elbow tendons, may be helpful. With rest, pain usually subsides, although resistance exercises also may be beneficial. Other conservative measures include ice and topical or oral NSAIDs, which may provide short-term symptomatic relief. Symptoms usually improve over 3 to 4 weeks unless re-injury occurs."

"). Walking and ankle flexion exercises are inexpensive, safe, and effective treatment for nonulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. These interventions activate the calf-muscle \"venous pump\" to move lower extremity venous blood proximally. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated the benefits of long-term compression therapy in patients with CVI with associated edema, ulcer, or eczema. Before starting compression stockings, patients with weak pulses or risk factors for atherosclerosis should have ankle-brachial index measurements because compression therapy is contraindicated in patients with peripheral artery disease. CVI results from persistent venous hypertension caused by venous incompetence or occlusion. It is commonly seen in older persons, those who are overweight, or those with previous conditions (thrombophlebitis, trauma) in which the lower extremity venous system may have been damaged. Manifestations of CVI include edema, varicose veins, skin hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, cellulitis, and ulceration (such as in this patient, who has a healed ulcer on the right medial ankle). Diagnosis is usually made based on history and examination alone, but duplex ultrasonography can be helpful in unclear cases or when planning surgery. Medications should be reviewed because certain drugs (e.g., dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) can exacerbate dependent edema."

An AHI of 5 to 15 indicates mild OSA, an AHI of 16 to 30 indicates moderate sleep apnea, and an AHI of more than 30 indicates severe OSA. It is estimated that 24% of men aged 30 to 60 years and 9% of similarly aged women have OSA (AHI of at least 5/hour). CPAP should be considered first-line therapy in any patient who has OSA and associated symptoms, particularly excessive daytime sleepiness. Optimal positive airway pressure therapy may have salutary effects on the cardiovascular diseases associated with OSA. Suboptimal adherence to CPAP is common in clinical practice, and rates of discontinuation are high. Therefore, objective monitoring of use and periodic follow-up are important to ensure adherence."

CES is an uncommon but potentially catastrophic condition caused by compression and ischemia of some or all of the 18 descending nerve roots that make up the cauda equina, with resulting neurologic impairment. Causes may be benign (such as degenerative changes, disk herniation, spondylosis, and other structural abnormalities of the spine; infection; or bleeding) or malignant (with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and prostate cancer being the most commonly associated cancers). Classic clinical findings include acute low back pain, radicular pain, and bilateral leg weakness. CES may be associated with perineal sensory symptoms; bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction; and decreased or absent distal reflexes. However, not all of these features present early in the syndrome. For example, pain is the most common early symptom and may precede other neurologic findings; bowel and bladder dysfunction are usually late manifestations and do not occur in all patients. Urgent neuroimaging with MRI and surgical treatment offer the best chance of avoiding permanent neurologic damage."

The diagnosis of functional dyspepsia requires negative results on upper endoscopy and other tests for organic diseases. Given the low incidence of malignancy and with consideration given to the cost-effectiveness of evaluating dyspepsia in younger adults, the ACG and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) have jointly recommended routine use of upper endoscopy only in patients aged 60 years and older to exclude malignancy. The ACG/CAG guidelines recommend against routine use of upper endoscopy in patients younger than 60 years with dyspepsia, even in most patients with alarm features (weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, and vomiting) because these features poorly predict organic structural pathology, such as malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, or esophagitis. Consideration of endoscopy at a younger age is reasonable for patients at higher risk of malignancy, such as those with childhood years spent in a region where gastric cancer is endemic (Asia, Russia, and South America) or those with a positive family history."

Specific symptoms of hypogonadism in the adult male include decreased morning and spontaneous erections, mastodynia, gynecomastia, decreased need for shaving, and/or decreased axillary and genital hair. According to Endocrine Society guidelines, an initial morning measurement of a patient's total testosterone level should be performed to assess for hypogonadism; if results are abnormal, a second confirmatory morning measurement should be obtained before additional testing is begun.

For patients with a focal abnormality noted on clinical examination or mammogram, targeted ultrasonography can clarify the size of the mass, determine whether the mass is solid or cystic, and identify the margins as smooth or irregular. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial method of evaluation for women younger than 30 years, in whom mammography has low sensitivity due to dense breasts. It is also the test of choice in pregnant patients. Approximately 10% to 20% of palpable breast cancers are not detected by mammography or ultrasonography. Negative ultrasound or a normal mammogram in a patient with a discrete breast mass does not rule out malignancy; therefore, this patient requires further evaluation to characterize the nature of the breast mass. Core needle biopsy, with ultrasonographic or stereotactic guidance (when detectable on imaging), provides excellent tissue sampling for pathology, and if malignant, for hormone receptor status. It is the test of choice for most palpable, solid lesions. This patient with a palpable, firm breast mass but negative imaging results should undergo palpation-guided core needle biopsy."

These findings have nearly 100% sensitivity for identifying patients with clinically important findings but low specificity. This patient sustained a TBI with a dangerous mechanism of injury several hours ago and has developed symptoms (worsening headache and vomiting) mentioned in the guideline.

Typically, patients present with pain on activity that is relieved with rest, and point tenderness. The most common location for fatigue fracture is the tibia. Insufficiency fractures typically occur in the spine, sacrum, pelvis, or knee. Insufficiency fracture of the knee has previously been known as spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, but it is now recognized that this entity likely represents subchondral microfractures. It is more common in women and associated with meniscal tears in 80% of cases. Radiography is first-line diagnostic testing but may fail to reveal a fracture. MRI has greater sensitivity; it should be performed when plain films are unrevealing but clinical probability is high. This patient is postmenopausal, putting her at risk for osteoporosis and insufficiency fracture, and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Management is usually conservative with NSAIDs or analgesics and protected weight bearing; studies indicate conflicting results for bisphosphonate therapy.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is typically characterized by narrowing of the aortic bifurcation and arteries of the lower extremities, including the iliac, femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause. The most commonly used diagnostic modality to identify lower extremity PAD is measurement of the resting ankle-brachial index, the ratio of lower extremity to upper extremity systolic blood pressures. In healthy persons, the ankle pressure should be the same as or slightly higher than the brachial pressure; therefore, a normal resting ABI is between 1.00 and 1.40. In the presence of atherosclerotic narrowing of the limb arteries, the downstream blood pressure and concomitant ABI value is lower. A resting ABI of 0.90 or less is diagnostic for PAD and correlates with abnormalities seen on imaging of the arterial tree. A resting ABI greater than 1.40 indicates the presence of noncompressible, calcified arteries in the lower extremities and is considered uninterpretable. This is most commonly found in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or advanced chronic kidney disease. In patients with an ABI greater than 1.40, a toe-brachial index is used for diagnosis. A toe-brachial index less than 0.70 is diagnostic for PAD."

"). The increased femoral cortical width on the previous plain radiograph is a characteristic finding in patients who later have atypical femoral fractures. This complication is believed to occur as a result of a reduction in bone turnover and, therefore, bone repair after prolonged treatment with bisphosphonates. The abnormal bone is fragile and prone to fracture. A large, prospective cohort study identified risk factors for bisphosphonate-related atypical fractures: duration of bisphosphonate therapy greater than 3 to 5 years, older age, chronic glucocorticoid use, shorter height, and higher weight. In this group, the risk for an atypical fracture was decreased with discontinuation of bisphosphonates. In one large study, the number needed to harm during a 3-year period in order to encounter one case of atypical femoral fracture was 417, whereas the number needed to prevent a single vertebral fracture was 14 and to prevent a hip fracture was 91. Simply stated, for every atypical femoral fracture encountered, 30 vertebral fractures and five hip fractures were prevented. Although this analysis favors the use of bisphosphonates in appropriate patients, it also underscores the need for discretion in the selection of patients and supports consideration of a drug holiday in stable improved patients after 5 years of continuous bisphosphonate use."

Groin pain suggests lesser trochanteric and is worse with hip flexion and rotation. Pain over the greater trochanter suggests greater trochanteric fracture which increases with abduction and tenderness over the greater trochanter. The patient's age and findings are not consistent with trochanteric fracture."

HCM is associated with an ejection-quality murmur usually best heard at left lower sternal border; it generally does not radiate to the carotid arteries. Brisk carotid upstroke is present and may have two impulses for each ejection (bifid). The murmur of HCM increases in intensity of murmur during Valsalva strain phase. The murmur of aortic stenosis either does not change or is diminished during Valsalva strain phase. This patient's findings are not compatible with findings associated with HCM."

In a randomized phase III study of euvolemic patients whose hemoglobin level decreased to less than 9 g/dL (90 g/L) within 72 hours of ICU admission, participants were assigned to a liberal transfusion group (transfusion given at hemoglobin level <10 g/dL [100 g/L]) or a restrictive transfusion group (transfusion given at hemoglobin level <7 g/dL [70 g/L]). Mortality rates were at least as good for patients in the restrictive group as for those in the liberal group. However, a subset analysis revealed that patients with ischemic heart disease had a trend toward higher mortality in the restrictive group that was not statistically significant, which suggests that patients with ischemic heart disease should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis until further data dictate otherwise.

Eliciting information on specific symptoms of UTI (dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, flank pain, hematuria) may be difficult in older patients with dementia, delirium, or preexisting chronic urinary symptoms. Because the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age, it may be inappropriately attributed as the cause of various nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, malaise, fever, confusion, delirium). Finding bacteriuria in older patients with nonspecific symptoms may lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, with consequences such as antibiotic resistance and antibiotic-related side effects, which may be severe. Urine testing should be limited to patients with specific symptoms of UTI, such as new or worsening urgency, frequency, incontinence, suprapubic or costovertebral tenderness, or hematuria, or findings of a new, serious illness consistent with sepsis.

"), such as diltiazem or nifedipine. Anal fissures are longitudinal mucosal tears in the anal canal characterized by anorectal pain worsened by bowel movements and sitting. They are common, particularly after episodes of constipation or diarrhea. Pain is the most common symptom, but hematochezia may occur, which sometimes leads to an incorrect diagnosis of complicated hemorrhoids. The disease is confirmed by the presence of a fissure on anorectal inspection; the fissure is typically located posteriorly in the anal canal. Lateral and/or multiple fissures may be seen in association with syphilis, HIV infection, and Crohn disease. Acute anal fissures generally resolve within a few weeks with the use of sitz baths, psyllium, and bulking agents. Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine, and anti-inflammatory agents can be considered to address pain or bleeding, but their use is not required to promote fissure healing. Anal fissures lasting more than 8 to 12 weeks are considered chronic and may be characterized by edema and fibrosis, as well as a sentinel pile (appearing as a skin tag) or hypertrophied anal papilla within the anal canal. Rectal spasm is the major reason for anal fissures becoming chronic and should be treated with either topical calcium channel blockers or nitrates. Topical nitroglycerin use is limited by headaches, a common side effect. Colonoscopy is indicated when additional alarm features are present; these include age older than 45 years, altered bowel habits, anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, unexplained weight loss, and/or family history of colorectal cancer."

"), is the safest choice. This patient likely has allergic contact dermatitis in reaction to his cologne. Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IV, T-cell–mediated, delayed hypersensitivity reaction. On re-exposure to a specific allergen, sensitized T-cells trigger an inflammatory cascade, leading to an eczematous eruption at the site of contact; rarely, a widespread eruption (autoeczematization or id reaction) may occur. Irritant contact dermatitis is more common than allergic contact dermatitis and is not immune mediated. Irritant contact dermatitis occurs from direct damage to the skin from harsh chemicals, soaps, or detergents. In addition to avoidance of the causative agent and treatment with emollients several times a day, topical glucocorticoids may help with symptom resolution. Appropriate choice of a topical glucocorticoid requires consideration of both the nature of the skin disease and the anatomic site being treated. Adverse effects of topical glucocorticoids include thinning of the skin, development of striae and hypopigmentation, and, with long-term use, development of telangiectasias. Anatomic areas that are at particular risk of complications from topical glucocorticoids include the face (particularly around the eyes, where skin is very thin) and any occluded areas of skin, such as the axillae, inguinal folds, skin under pendulous breasts, and abdominal pannus. When used on the face, halogenated (mid- and high-potency) glucocorticoids can induce acne, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, and rebound dermatitis. To minimize the risk of complications, lower-potency glucocorticoids should be used in intertriginous areas, and hydrocortisone base should be used on the face. Patients should be taught to use an adequate amount of glucocorticoid to treat the affected skin and should be encouraged to use it only as long as necessary."

He has type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with increased risk for CKD, and testing for albuminuria is appropriate. The National Kidney Foundation and the American Diabetes Association recommend annual testing to assess urine albumin excretion in patients with type 1 DM of 5 years' duration and in all patients with type 2 DM starting at the time of diagnosis by measuring the urine albumin-creatinine ratio. Moderately increased albuminuria is defined as an albumin-creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g to 300 mg/g; diagnosis requires an elevated albumin-creatinine ratio on two of three random samples obtained over 6 months. Patients with DM and moderately increased albuminuria are at increased risk for progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease.

Therefore, obtaining urine ratios on random urine samples is recommended as an alternative method of estimating proteinuria in the clinical assessment of kidney disease. Furthermore, a 24-hour urine collection may not diagnose moderately increased albuminuria. Finally, screening for CKD 5 years after the diagnosis of DM is appropriate for type 1 DM but not in this patient with type 2 DM; screening should be initiated at the time of diagnosis."

The appearance of new lesions is common, particularly with advancing age. Seborrheic keratoses are not usually associated with any other medical condition. The sign of Lester-Trélat is the sudden eruption, usually over 3 to 6 months, of numerous seborrheic keratoses, usually on an inflammatory base, and is associated with an internal malignancy."

Classic symptoms include cough that lasts from 2 to 3 weeks, mild dyspnea, and sputum production. Findings on examination can include wheezing or rhonchi that are extinguished after coughing. Bronchitis is treated with supportive care. Several studies have shown an absence of benefit and possible harms in treating bronchitis with antibiotics. The presence of purulent sputum cannot be considered indicative of a bacterial etiology or a favorable response to treatment in acute bronchitis. Similarly, the duration of this patient's cough (9 days) does not confirm a bacterial cause, as the typical duration of cough in viral bronchitis is 2 to 3 weeks. This contrasts with the approach in acute rhinosinusitis, in which lack of improvement after 10 days and the presence of purulent nasal discharge suggest a bacterial etiology."

When caused by viral infection, fever may be present within the first 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset and is often associated with other symptoms, such as myalgia and fatigue, but temperature normalizes afterward. Bacterial sinusitis is more likely if there are severe symptoms associated with a high fever for at least 3 or 4 consecutive days after onset of illness or if symptoms are persistent (lasting >10 days). Initial treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is focused on symptom relief with analgesics, intranasal glucocorticoids, and nasal saline irrigation.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with duplex ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and selective screening for men in this same age group who have never smoked but are otherwise at increased risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. AAA is a major and treatable cause of mortality, and risk factors (e.g., male sex, smoking history, advancing age) have been well established. In patients with AAA diameter smaller than 4.0 cm, surveillance with duplex ultrasonography every 2 to 3 years is warranted. In patients with AAA diameter of 4.0 to less than 5.5 cm, surveillance with CT angiography or duplex ultrasonography should be performed every 6 to 12 months. Once the aortic diameter meets the threshold for aortic repair (≥5.5 cm), CT angiography or MR angiography is indicated to determine the exact location of the AAA (suprarenal, juxtarenal, or infrarenal) for planning repair. Statin therapy is the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia and the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Patients eligible for secondary prevention therapy include those with acute coronary syndrome, history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease including aortic aneurysm. High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are aged 75 years or younger to achieve a reduction in LDL cholesterol of 50% or greater."

Patient age, comorbid conditions, and ability to tolerate open surgical repair determine which procedure is performed in patients with an infrarenal AAA. EVAR is associated with lower short-term (30-day) morbidity and mortality but no significant differences in long-term mortality. Additionally, EVAR is associated with greater need for repeat intervention and significantly higher rates of endoleak, device failure, and postimplantation syndrome (fever, leukocytosis, elevated serum C-reactive protein level). Before the choice between EVAR and open surgery is made, advanced imaging is necessary to determine the exact location of the AAA and potential involvement of other vessels."

"). Constipation can present as infrequent, difficult, or incomplete defecation. It can be acute or chronic and either secondary or idiopathic in nature. Medications are the most common cause of secondary constipation. The history should include an assessment for the presence of alarm features: hematochezia, acute constipation in elderly patients, unintentional weight loss, family history of colorectal cancer, unexplained anemia, and age older than 50 years with no previous colonoscopy. Anorectal examination, including a digital examination during Valsalva maneuver, is an important part of the physical examination because it may identify anatomic or functional causes of an evacuation disorder. A flat plate radiograph of the abdomen is the most useful initial study because it can assess for the presence and distribution of excessive stool in the colon and/or rectum. Initial treatment includes diet and lifestyle changes (adequate water intake, dietary fiber, exercise), medication review, and evaluating for underlying endocrine, metabolic, neuropathic, or mechanical causes. Treatment options include bulking agents (first line), osmotic laxatives (second line), stimulant laxatives (rescue if no bowel movements), secretagogues, and/or biofeedback. The evidence for treatment efficacy is strongest for PEG and the secretagogues lubiprostone and linaclotide.

") is the next step in management. SCC is the second most common skin cancer and arises from epidermal keratinocytes. Histopathologic examination is needed to confirm the diagnosis and for staging and prognosis. This can be achieved with an excisional biopsy or with a shave or punch biopsy. Smoking is a risk factor for SCC; other risk factors include sun exposure, human papillomavirus infection, immunosuppression, fair skin or hair color, older age, history of nonmelanoma skin malignancy, and arsenic exposure. SCC can have multiple appearances, including papules, plaques, and nodules that can ulcerate, bleed, or become crusty. SCC of the nail unit commonly arises in the nail fold and appears as a hyperkeratotic papule and plaque. In lightly pigmented skin, SCC tends to occur in areas of sun exposure. In patients with darker skin, SCC more often develops on areas of chronic inflammation or scarring and more commonly on the lower extremities. High-risk factors for SCC are tumor diameter greater than 2 cm, tumor thickness greater than 2 mm, poorly differentiated subtypes, perineural invasion, and tumor location on the ear or nonglabrous lip. SCC can be locally invasive and can metastasize."

Nonmodifiable risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) include age (94% of new cases of CRC occurring in adults age 45 years or older), male sex, and a personal or family history of colon adenomas or colorectal cancer. The risk doubles with a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative. Long-standing (≥8 years) colonic inflammatory bowel disease (both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) is associated with about a 2.7-fold increased risk and is dependent on the severity and extent of bowel involvement. Adult survivors of childhood malignancy who received abdominal radiation are also at increased risk for CRC. Familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome are associated with markedly increased risks for colorectal neoplasia and other malignancies. This patient has a nonsyndromic family history, which is also associated with increased CRC risk. If CRC is diagnosed in a first-degree relative aged less than 60 years or two or more first-degree relatives at any age, colonoscopy should begin at age 40 years or 10 years earlier than the age of the youngest first-degree relative at diagnosis, whichever comes first.

When these medications no longer provide sufficient control or if moderate to severe pain is present, adding as-needed short-acting, immediate-release (IR) opioid therapy is appropriate. This patient has moderate pain that returns before his next scheduled dose of IR opioid therapy and requires four doses per day continuously. He would benefit from use of a sustained-release (SR) opioid. An appropriate solution would be SR morphine twice daily. A breakthrough pain strategy should be available so that the patient has options if the SR medication does not provide complete relief. When adding an SR opioid, a strategy to avoid overmedication is to give a starting dose of 30% to 50% of the patient's average 24-hour opioid dosage. The dose of the opioid for breakthrough pain is calculated as 10% of the total daily opioid dosage given as an IR opioid.

Although rare, methimazole has been associated with fetal development of aplasia cutis (absence of a portion of skin on the scalp in a localized or widespread area) and choanal atresia (blockage of the posterior nasal passage due to failed recanalization of the nasal fossae during fetal development) when used in the first trimester. Once organogenesis is complete, methimazole can be substituted for PTU. However, switching between antithyroid drugs in the middle of pregnancy may precipitate decompensation of control and thus must be carried out cautiously."

There is also an increased risk for severe liver toxicity with PTU. Regardless of the antithyroid drug used, the lowest effective dosage should be administered during pregnancy to prevent fetal hypothyroidism."

Acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease (pseudogout) typically presents as a monoarticular inflammatory arthritis, characterized by sudden onset of swelling, pain, loss of function, tenderness, and warmth of the affected joint, usually a knee or wrist. Similar to acute gout, flares may be provoked by systemic insults such as major surgery or acute illness. Flares are usually milder than those of gout but can persist for months if untreated. This patient has intracellular positively birefringent (blue when parallel to and yellow when perpendicular to the polarizing axis of an optical filter) rhomboid-shaped calcium pyrophosphate crystals, consistent with a diagnosis of pseudogout. If present on radiographs, linear calcium deposits in the cartilage (chondrocalcinosis) would also support the diagnosis of pseudogout. Treatment is directed exclusively toward relieving the inflammation with agents such as NSAIDs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids and is tailored to the individual patient. Initial therapy with an intra-articular glucocorticoid (after aspiration confirms no infection is present) is usually recommended as first-line therapy if the joint is amenable to injection."

"), and the thyroid function tests should be repeated in 2 to 4 weeks. Pregnancy is known to increase levothyroxine requirements in most patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy, and this expected increase should be anticipated by increasing her levothyroxine dosage. The levothyroxine dosage is typically increased in the first (and sometimes in the second) trimester of pregnancy, with a possible total increase of 30% to 50%. During pregnancy, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be maintained in the lower half of the trimester-specific reference range, or less than 2.5 µU/mL (2.5 mU/L) if trimester-specific reference ranges are unavailable. In contrast, the upper range of normal for nonpregnant patients is approximately 4.5 to 5.0 µU/mL (4.5-5.0 mU/L)."

In pregnant women with hypothyroidism, thyroid function testing should be frequent, preferably every 4 weeks, to protect the health of mother and fetus and to avoid pregnancy complications.

Reactions often become more intense with repeated exposure. ACD is usually intensely itchy. In acute reactions, the skin is red, edematous, weepy, and crusted, with possible vesicles or bullae. Chronic exposure results in chronic eczema. The hands are a common site for ACD, especially in health care workers. Exposure history and pattern of the rash may provide clues as to the causal allergen. Epicutaneous patch testing is the gold standard for diagnosis of ACD and should be performed to evaluate recurrent or recalcitrant dermatitis. Patch testing is performed by applying multiple standardized chemicals on small discs to the patient's back, typically over three visits within a 1-week period. Patients should diligently avoid any identified allergens. Acutely, topical glucocorticoids are used for pruritus and inflammation. Systemic glucocorticoids may be used for severe cases for 2 to 3 weeks but should not be a long-term therapy."

Because of the inability to excrete hydrogen ions, patients develop a metabolic acidosis with compensatory hyperchloremia, resulting in a normal anion gap (8 mEq/L in this patient) and the inability to acidify urine below a pH of 6.0. The urine pH is therefore almost always inappropriately elevated for the degree of acidemia. The same defects also cause potassium wasting, and the increased proximal resorption of citrate that occurs with metabolic acidosis leads to hypocitraturia and an increased risk for calcium phosphate kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. Type 1 RTA is associated with genetic causes, autoimmune disorders, nephrocalcinosis/hypercalciuria, dysproteinemias, drugs/toxins, and tubulointerstitial disease; this patient has sicca complex secondary to Sjögren syndrome and kidney involvement with interstitial nephritis and a type 1 (hypokalemic distal) RTA."

Elevated liver enzyme levels support the diagnosis, but normal values do not rule it out. Depending on the patient's demographics and social history, investigations for viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis may be conducted. Abdominal ultrasonography is inexpensive and widely available, and it has a sensitivity of approximately 80% for detecting steatosis when hepatocytes contain more than 20% of histologically detected fat. Because complications of NAFLD include liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, patients with NAFLD should have screening ultrasonography every 3 years. If fibrosis/cirrhosis is present, ultrasonographic screening should take place every 6 months. No specific treatment for NAFLD is available; therefore, weight reduction and moderation/cessation of alcohol use are strongly recommended. After the initial diagnosis of NAFLD, further evaluation for advanced fibrosis may be needed, particularly in patients with metabolic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia."

A combination of two agents at moderate doses is often more successful at achieving BP goals than one BP agent at maximal dose and minimizes the adverse effects that are more commonly noted at higher doses. Guidelines recommend that drug combinations with similar mechanisms of action or clinical effects should be avoided. For example, two drugs from the same class should not be administered together (e.g., two different β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers). Likewise, two drugs from classes that target the same BP control system are less effective and potentially harmful when used together (e.g., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers). Exceptions to this rule include concomitant use of a thiazide diuretic, potassium-sparing diuretic, and/or loop diuretic in various combinations. Also, dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be combined. Combined use of any renin-angiotensin system drug classes (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors) is harmful; several clinical trials have revealed more adverse events with these combinations (hyperkalemia, hypotension, acute kidney injury), without additional cardiovascular or kidney benefits."

Nonpharmacologic behavioral therapy is recommended first-line treatment for urinary incontinence, and behavioral therapy utilizing prompted voiding is the most appropriate management for this patient whose incontinence may be due to her cognitive impairment and decreased mobility. Prompted voiding involves regularly asking the patient to report on incontinence, asking the patient if he or she needs to void, providing assistance with access to the bathroom, and praising the patient for continence. This technique has been shown to reduce urinary incontinence in older patients who have caregivers capable of working with them, including those residing in assisted-care facilities. Prompted voiding should be timed to occur before a large volume of urine has accumulated in the bladder, reducing the likelihood of incontinence. With active and consistent caregiver involvement, prompted urination can help achieve improved bladder control."

"). BE is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease in which the normal squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by specialized columnar epithelium. Patients with BE have more severe esophageal acid reflux than those with nonerosive reflux disease. BE is a premalignant condition; patients have an estimated 30- to 50-fold increased risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma compared with those without BE, with an annual incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma of 0.5%. Patients without dysplasia have very low risk for progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Due to high interpersonal variability in staging BE, the diagnosis should be made by a pathologist with expertise in esophageal disease. In patients without dysplasia, surveillance upper endoscopy every 3 to 5 years is recommended. Patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia are candidates for ablation therapy, but endoscopic surveillance, as initially chosen for this patient, is an accepted alternative. Patients with high-grade dysplasia should undergo treatment to eradicate all neoplastic and at-risk epithelium. Endoscopic therapy for BE includes mucosal resection as well as ablation, of which radiofrequency is the best studied. Ablation has a high rate of eradication of both metaplasia and dysplasia. Because BE has a high tendency to recur, continuation of treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole, and posttreatment surveillance are essential."

"). Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart failure in the United States (>50% of patients) and should be considered in all patients with newly diagnosed heart failure. The decision to evaluate for CAD depends on the patient's symptoms and risk factors (family history, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, tobacco use). Additionally, findings on ECG and echocardiography may suggest an ischemic cause for left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with exertional chest pain, history of myocardial infarction, or other symptoms suggesting CAD should undergo further evaluation with stress testing or cardiac catheterization as clinically appropriate. Identification of significant CAD is important, as left ventricular dysfunction caused by ischemia may improve or resolve with percutaneous or surgical revascularization. This patient has a high likelihood for ischemic heart disease as evidenced by a previous inferior wall myocardial infarction on ECG, which likely accounts for her symptoms and reduced ejection fraction. Given the high pretest probability of ischemic heart disease and findings suggestive of extensive myocardial ischemia, coronary angiography is indicated in this patient."

Two percent to 4% of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism progress to overt hypothyroidism yearly, whereas in one third of patients, thyroid function will spontaneously revert to normal. The normal range for TSH increases with age, and a TSH level of up to 7.9 µU/mL (7.9 mU/L) is within the normal range for persons 80 years of age and older.

"). The first step in pleural fluid analysis is to assess the appearance of the pleural fluid. The next step is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or exudate. Transudates are due to an imbalance between hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, as occurs with heart failure and cirrhosis, the two most common causes. Exudates are due to inflammation causing increased capillary permeability, impaired drainage by lymphatics, or both. There are many causes of exudative effusions, but the most common are infection and malignancy. Differentiation is commonly made using the Light criteria. These criteria are very sensitive for exudates; however, they are less specific, and approximately 25% of transudates are misclassified as exudates. Light criteria define an exudative effusion by the presence of any one of the following findings: pleural fluid to serum protein ratio greater than 0.5, a pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to serum LDH ratio greater than 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH more than two thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH. This patient's pleural fluid is consistent with a transudative process. Pleural fluid differentiation into an exudative category by at least one of the Light criteria is nearly 100% sensitive but less specific. Specificity further declines when a transudative process is treated with diuretic therapy, as may be the case in a patient in whom heart failure remains the most likely posttest diagnosis. Pleural fluid cholesterol level greater than 55 mg/dL is a less sensitive indicator of exudative effusion than the Light criteria, but it is more specific and would increase posttest probability of an exudate. A difference of less than 1.2 g/dL between serum and pleural fluid albumin levels is also more specific for an exudate than the Light criteria. For other patients in whom an exudative effusion is not clinically suspected but is suggested by the Light criteria, further testing may be necessary."

Early diagnosis has not been shown to reduce morbidity or mortality due to prostate cancer. Screening carries risks related to prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as well as harms from subsequent diagnosis and treatment. PSA testing frequently produces false-positive results, as PSA elevation is seen not only in prostate cancer but also in prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia. This can lead to anxiety and unnecessary prostate biopsies. The harms of biopsies include pain, infection, urinary obstruction, and hematospermia. Screening for prostate cancer also leads to overdiagnosis (the diagnosis of cancer that would not become clinically apparent or caused harm in the patient's lifetime), and treatment of these patients exposes them to potential long-term harms, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction. Thus, all major professional organizations encourage patients to discuss the potential harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening with their physician before making individual decisions. It is reasonable to initiate these conversations at age 50 years with average-risk patients with a life expectancy of at least 10 years."

This patient describes vertigo, which is the sensation that her stationary environment is spinning around her (or that one is spinning around in one's environment). There are two major categories of vertigo: peripheral and central. In addition to history and risk factors, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is very helpful in distinguishing peripheral from central vertigo. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver indicates a peripheral vertigo when there is a latency period of 2 to 20 seconds before the onset of the positional nystagmus, the duration of nystagmus is less than 1 minute, and the nystagmus is fatigable with repeated Dix-Hallpike maneuvers. This patient has typical symptoms of BPPV, including episodes of vertigo lasting less than 1 minute and provocation by rapid changes in head movement, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver confirms the peripheral nature of her vertigo. Other common causes of peripheral vertigo include vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, and Meniere disease."

Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated for patients with ischemic heart disease and reduced ejection fraction 40 or more days after acute myocardial infarction and 90 or more days after revascularization, while on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Because this patient underwent primary revascularization for acute myocardial infarction, she should be treated with optimal medical therapy, and repeat echocardiography should be performed after 90 days to reassess ejection fraction. Reduced ejection fraction immediately following myocardial infarction may be related to myocardial stunning and can improve over the next few months, especially with GDMT."

In women with prolonged anovulation, there is exposure to unopposed estrogen without the normal endometrial protective effect of progesterone. This increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy.

In women younger than 45 years with anovulatory bleeding and no other risk factors for endometrial cancer, hormonal therapy for anovulation is appropriate.

This response is not seen in this patient (urine osmolality is low compared with serum osmolality); therefore, she has either DI or osmotic diuresis. Patients with hyperosmolality who have submaximally concentrated urine without evidence of osmotic diuresis have DI by definition. The patient's glucose concentration is normal, arguing against osmotic diuresis. Distinguishing between central and nephrogenic DI in a patient who already demonstrates hyperosmolality can be done by measuring antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels (patients with central DI have an inappropriately low level, whereas patients with nephrogenic DI have a normal to elevated level) or by evaluating the response to administering the vasopressor analogue desmopressin (arginine vasopressin). A significant increase in urine osmolality (>50%) within 1 to 2 hours after administration indicates central DI, whereas a lack of response indicates nephrogenic DI. Central DI can result from tumors that invade the hypothalamus, infiltrating diseases such as sarcoidosis, or surgical destruction. Nephrogenic DI can be caused by medications (for example, lithium), hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, sickle cell disease and trait, and amyloidosis. Central DI can be treated with intranasal or oral desmopressin."

Because maternal immunity wanes over time, administering the Tdap vaccine between 27 weeks' and 36 weeks' gestation is thought to provide optimal protection against pertussis for the infant throughout the newborn period, during which time the child is solely dependent on maternal antibodies for protection, by boosting the mother's antibody levels.

There is often, although not universally, a positive family history. This patient's otherwise normal neurologic examination rules out alternative diagnoses such as Parkinson disease or dystonia. Assessment of any form of action tremor should include thyroid and renal function studies, liver chemistries, serum electrolytes, and a review of medications. Patients younger than 40 years should undergo screening for Wilson disease with serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper measurements.

Additional symptoms may include heartburn, weight loss, and chest pain unresponsive to acid-reducing agents. Symptoms are slowly progressive, with patients waiting an average of 5 years before seeking medical attention. Achalasia is a hypertonic motility condition defined by inadequate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and aperistalsis. Achalasia can be idiopathic or associated with viral, autoimmune, or neurodegenerative disorders and infection (Chagas disease). Damage to the ganglion cells and myenteric plexus in the esophageal body and LES leads to uncontested cholinergic nerve activation, which prevents LES relaxation. Approaches to the treatment of achalasia include endoscopic (botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilation, peroral endoscopic myotomy) or surgical intervention with the goal of lowering LES pressure, which relieves symptoms. Medical therapy with nitrates and calcium channel blockers is ineffective and not recommended."

The decision to treat this patient for an extended period is consistent with current guidelines, which suggest extended anticoagulant therapy in patients with unprovoked proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism who have low or moderate bleeding risk. Guidelines also suggest considering reduced-dose anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban or rivaroxaban) when opting for extended anticoagulation therapy.

At the earliest stage, the median 5-year survival for non–small cell lung cancer is 77%. Therefore, patients with earlier detection and treatment have the greatest chance for cure. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. This recommendation is based on results from a series of randomized controlled trials. In the largest trial, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), low-dose CT had a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 73.4% for the detection of lung cancer. The NLST demonstrated a 16% reduction in lung cancer mortality with low-dose CT. All persons enrolled in a screening program who are current smokers should receive smoking cessation interventions."

"). MS is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes inflammatory damage to the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Relapses or flares involve development of neurologic symptoms over the course of hours to days and often peak in severity over the course of days to weeks. This is typically followed by a period of remission lasting weeks to months. Remyelination and recruitment of other brain regions to functionally substitute for the damaged area may result in clinical improvement during times of remission. The most common clinical manifestations of MS are optic neuritis, myelitis, and brainstem/cerebellar syndromes. This patient had a previous self-limited episode of diplopia and a new episode of optic neuritis (as suggested by monocular blurry vision with optic disc pallor) and central pattern focal right leg weakness (suggested by hyperreflexia and plantar extensor response). An MRI of the brain and cervical spine should be obtained to evaluate for lesions consistent with MS. If they are present, a diagnosis of MS is likely, based on validated diagnostic criteria, which require symptoms of CNS demyelination separated in space and time from a series of clinical relapses or progression, signs on physical examination, distribution of lesions on MRI, and (if necessary) the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-unique oligoclonal bands. In this patient, the occurrence of two disparate clinical events happening at separate times satisfies criteria for dissemination in time, and the presence of an optic nerve (cranial nerve II) lesion (detected on clinical examination) and additional lesions (if shown by MRI) would satisfy criteria for dissemination in space."

This patient has severe asthma, which is asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence to maximal optimized therapy and treatment of contributory factors, that worsens when high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid treatment is decreased, or that requires continuous oral glucocorticoids. Severe asthma is characterized by frequent exacerbations; patients may require emergency department visits or hospitalizations and may experience long durations of treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids. This patient's asthma has not been controlled despite trigger avoidance and treatment with multiple controller drugs. Omalizumab is indicated in patients with severe persistent asthma inadequately controlled with standard therapy who have elevated IgE levels and sensitivity to multiple allergens, as documented by skin testing, or elevated serum allergen-specific IgE.

OA is a chronic progressive multifactorial disorder of maladaptive cellular repair responses to joint stress. It is a clinical diagnosis, and the cardinal symptom is pain with activity that is relieved with rest. Affected patients also typically experience morning stiffness that lasts for less than 30 minutes daily. Bony hypertrophy is commonly detected in the fingers, and Heberden nodes of the distal interphalangeal joints and Bouchard nodes of the proximal interphalangeal joints may be easily palpated. OA also may cause squaring or boxing of the carpometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb.

Because other diseases can be associated with rheumatoid factor, its specificity for RA is somewhat limited. Anti-CCP antibodies are present in 70% of patients with RA but have a specificity of 95%. Anti-CCP antibodies are also more predictive than rheumatoid factor for erosive disease. The key features of RA are swelling and tenderness in and around the metacarpal phalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and wrist joints and prominent morning stiffness lasting more than 1 hour.

Risk factors include gallstones, porcelain gallbladder (intramural calcification of the gallbladder wall), gallbladder polyps, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The potential resectability of this lesion should be evaluated with MRI and MRCP. The extent of local invasion can be evaluated, and the distinction between benign and malignant lesions potentially can be made. The initial treatment for gallbladder cancer is cholecystectomy.

"). The most life-threatening acute complication of diabetes mellitus is DKA, which mostly affects patients with type 1 diabetes younger than 65 years and is sometimes its presenting manifestation. DKA is associated with hyperglycemia (350-1000 mg/dL [19.4-56 mmol/L]) and must be treated early and aggressively to avoid life-threatening consequences caused by dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. At presentation, patients with DKA usually report a several-day history of polyuria, polydipsia, and blurred vision, culminating in nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and altered mental status. Physical examination typically reveals deep, labored breathing (Kussmaul respirations); a fruity odor to the breath (from acetone); poor skin turgor; tachycardia; and hypotension. This complication may occur as a result of precipitating acute stresses, such as infections (influenza, pneumonia, or gastroenteritis) or acute myocardial infarction; in patients with insulin pumps, when a technical interruption of insulin infusion occurs; and in patients who are nonadherent to their medication regimen. In almost all instances, DKA is entirely preventable if patients practice regular glucose monitoring and understand the need for increased insulin doses during acute stress events. The diagnosis of DKA is typically based on a blood glucose level greater than 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L), increased anion gap metabolic acidosis (arterial pH <7.3), a serum bicarbonate level of 18 mEq/L (18 mmol/L) or less, and presence of serum or urine ketones."

If the patient shows improvement after the first week, glucocorticoids are continued along with nutritional support for a total of 28 days. Improved short-term survival (30 days) is achieved in approximately 50% of patients on glucocorticoids, whereas long-term survival heavily depends on the degree of coexistent chronic liver disease and abstinence from alcohol.

"). This patient has recurrent prostate cancer after treatment for localized prostate cancer. The mainstay of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is ADT, provided by orchiectomy (surgical castration) or chemical castration. Surgical castration ADT provides cost-effective and rapid results and is widely used internationally. Chemical castration ADT is as effective as bilateral orchiectomy in treating patients with metastatic disease but is often preferred by patients in the United States. However, it requires repeated intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of hormonal agents. Chemical castration may be accomplished with a GnRH receptor agonist (leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, histrelin) or antagonist (degarelix). GnRH receptor agonists often initially trigger a surge of testosterone that can cause transient tumor growth; thereafter, the pituitary–testes axis is disrupted, which decreases testosterone levels and reduces the size of the tumor. The GnRH receptor antagonist degarelix lowers testosterone quickly and does not cause tumor flare. Oral antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and flutamide, directly block androgen receptors on cancer cells and are provided in combination with a GnRH agonist or antagonist. When used with a GnRH agonist, antiandrogens should be initiated first to protect against the transient testosterone surge caused by initiation of GnRH agonist therapy. In this patient with a lumbar spinal metastasis, ADT is indicated with surgical castration or a GnRH agonist or GnRH antagonist combined with an antiandrogen. Men with clinical metastatic disease who respond to ADT are considered to have castrate-sensitive prostate cancer. In this population, ADT can be combined with docetaxel, abiraterone/prednisone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide to improve survival. The choice of which specific agent to add to ADT is dependent on the volume of disease and prior treatment regimens. In a patient with metastatic disease following local therapy, such as radiation therapy, enzalutamide or apalutamide is indicated."

"), caspofungin, or anidulafungin, is the most appropriate management for this patient. When candidemia is likely to be the result of an intravenous (IV) catheter, the catheter must be removed promptly because it serves as a nidus for ongoing candidemia. For candidemia related to IV catheters, the duration is shorter and mortality rate is lower when the catheter is removed than when it remains in place. In addition, catheter salvage is extremely difficult with fungal colonization, almost always requiring removal of the catheter. Although removal of long-term catheters may be a management challenge in patients being treated with a prolonged course of antibiotics, such as this patient, alternative short-term access is indicated to continue treatment and allow antifungal therapy to be given. Empiric antifungal therapy should be started because candidemia can be prolonged and may lead to metastatic complications (endophthalmitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis) if not already present at the time of diagnosis. An echinocandin is typically the preferred empiric agent for all patients with candidemia. Other considerations in choosing empiric therapy include a history of recent azole exposure, prevalence of different species and susceptibility data in a particular institution, the severity of illness, comorbid conditions (such as neutropenia), and evidence of disseminated involvement (such as the central nervous system or eyes). Blood cultures should always be repeated until candidemia clearance is documented. Treatment should be given for 2 weeks after symptoms resolve and blood cultures are negative for candidemia, or longer if metastatic complications are present."

"). Although traditionally associated with children, more than half of cases of pertussis now occur in adolescents and adults. Symptoms in adults may be less severe than the “whooping cough” usually associated with infection in children, and a severe, persistent cough may be the primary clinical manifestation in adults. The incubation period is 7 to 10 days, which is then followed by the catarrhal phase that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks and is characterized by malaise, rhinorrhea, and mild cough. The paroxysmal phase, in which the other symptoms improve but the cough becomes severe, follows. Vigorous inspiration during paroxysms of cough causes the characteristic “whooping” sound, and the episodes of coughing may be severe enough to trigger emesis. This phase may last weeks to months if untreated, followed by the convalescent phase that lasts 1 to 3 months during which the cough slowly resolves. Pertussis is highly communicable, and treatment with a macrolide antibiotic in the first 2 to 3 weeks of infection decreases the severity of symptoms and decreases transmission of disease."

In young patients with probable diabetes, the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes should be made as soon as possible. The presence of ICAs, IAs, or GADAs is suggestive of type 1 diabetes, and he should begin receiving insulin immediately. Among patients with newly recognized type 1 diabetes, 90% have measurable antibodies against specific β-cell proteins present at the time of diagnosis. Insulin treatment in type 1 diabetes helps preserve endogenous insulin secretion for a longer period, which makes it easier to achieve excellent glycemic control without hypoglycemia. If testing does not show these antibodies, type 2 diabetes is more likely. In addition to lifestyle modifications, therapy with insulin may be required initially for this patient to control hyperglycemic symptoms, but then he may be transitioned to oral therapy, such as metformin."

The injury usually occurs at sites of anatomic narrowing of the esophagus, such as the aortic arch, the gastroesophageal junction, or the esophageal indentation caused by an enlarged left atrium. Symptoms may begin hours to days after therapy is started. GERD increases the risk for pill-induced esophagitis by providing an acidic environment and decreasing esophageal motility, which prolongs the pill contact time with the esophageal mucosa. Other risk factors include decreased salivary output, large pills, medications that increase the lower esophageal sphincter tone (opioids, anticholinergic agents), ingestion of medications in the supine position, and taking pills without adequate water ingestion. Tetracyclines, aspirin, NSAIDs, iron preparations, quinidine, potassium, and bisphosphonates have been identified as causative agents. Treatment includes avoiding the culprit medication, if possible. It is unclear if antacids, histamine-2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), or sucralfate are beneficial. PPIs are used if GERD is an associated comorbid condition. Preventive strategies to decrease pill-induced esophagitis include drinking plenty of water and remaining upright for 30 minutes after taking the medication."

It is important to avoid generating shear forces or friction during this procedure. The other element in pressure redistribution is the use of a pressure-reducing support surface. Many different categories of support surfaces are available, and within each category, there are a variety of different products. Head-to-head comparisons of support surfaces are generally lacking, and available evidence is weak. However, high-quality foam mattresses or foam overlays have been shown to reduce the incidence of pressure injury postoperatively.

This results in sudden, but transient, cutaneous swelling and erythema. Individual lesions may be erythematous or white, often surrounded by a red halo, and have a variety of shapes, including round, oval, annular, arciform, and serpiginous. The center of a lesion is typically blanchable pink or clear skin. These lesions are extremely pruritic and tend to appear on body sites with repetitive pressure or rubbing, such as the waistline and posterior neck. Although individual urticarial lesions should resolve in less than 24 hours, recurrent crops of hives may last for weeks. Acute urticaria may be related to environmental allergens, including drugs, viral infections, foods, and occasionally inhalants; however, in most cases, the cause is never determined. This man with transient, well-demarcated, pruritic plaques exhibits key features of acute urticaria. Chronic urticaria is an urticarial condition lasting longer than 6 weeks. If individual urticarial lesions do not resolve after 24 hours, or if they are accompanied by pain or systemic symptoms (joint pain, fever), urticarial vasculitis must be considered."

An elevated leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level, or procalcitonin level supports the diagnosis. Diverticulitis may be diagnosed based on the history and physical examination, but imaging is helpful and can predict failure of medical treatment and development of complications. Although uncomplicated diverticulitis traditionally has been treated with oral antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, current guidelines based on high-quality evidence strongly recommend that antibiotics be avoided in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis.

This patient is experiencing angioedema, likely triggered by use of the angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) valsartan-sacubitril, and should be intubated immediately because she is at high risk of asphyxiation from upper airway edema. Angioedema (localized subcutaneous or submucosal swelling of face, lips, or upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract) can be mast cell mediated (i.e., histaminergic), as in allergic IgE-mediated reactions to foods, drugs, and insect stings. The absence of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction, such as urticaria, pruritus, bronchospasm, and hypotension, is more typical of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which can be seen with hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, and ARNI or ACE inhibitor use. Although angioedema is most often reported early after starting or increasing the dose of an ARNI or ACE inhibitor, it can occur years later. The risk for recurrence with continued exposure to an ARNI or ACE inhibitor is substantial, and patients should be switched to an alternative medication. Angioedema typically resolves within 2 to 3 days of discontinuation."

Patients with three or more criteria, such as this patient, have an intermediate probability of GABHS pharyngitis; a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) should be performed, with confirmation of negative results with a throat culture only in patients at high risk for complications (immunocompromised patients). The advantage of the RADT is the immediate availability of results and high specificity (between 88% and 99%); if the test is positive, patients should be treated with antibiotics. The RADT has comparable sensitivity and specificity to throat culture. No guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for pharyngitis without confirmatory testing.

Gout is characterized by intermittent painful inflammatory joint flares in response to crystals formed because of excessive levels of urate (hyperuricemia). Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are a good treatment strategy when only one or two joints are affected, the presence of joint infection has been ruled out, and oral therapies have potential adverse events. Given the documented presence of intracellular urate crystals (negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals that are yellow when parallel and blue when perpendicular to a polarizing axis) and the negative synovial fluid on Gram stain, the probability of a joint infection is very low in this patient. Treatment for acute gout should focus on anti-inflammatory therapy, typically using colchicine, an NSAID, or a glucocorticoid. Although any of the three would effectively treat this patient's gout, the best choice would be a glucocorticoid because of potential adverse effects of other anti-inflammatory agents. Intra-articular glucocorticoids are preferred to systemic glucocorticoids in this patient to avoid the possible adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids in a patient with diabetes mellitus."

However, this triad occurs in only 30% of patients with CMI, and CMI should be suspected in the setting of recurrent postprandial abdominal pain. Diagnosis requires symptoms, exclusion of alternative causes of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss, and compatible radiographic findings. CT angiography (CTA) of the abdomen is the most useful test in the evaluation of mesenteric lesions and also aids in the evaluation of alternative diagnoses. MR angiography appears to be less valuable than CTA in the assessment of inferior mesenteric artery pathology but is preferred in patients with abnormal kidney function. It is recommended that patients with CMI and multivessel disease undergo revascularization, but the choice is less clear when only one artery is involved. Endovascular revascularization is usually the first choice, but its failure, as well as the presence of vasculitic or heavily calcified arteries, may require open surgery."

In rhabdomyolysis, myoglobin is released in the circulation from damaged skeletal muscle, causing AKI via intravascular volume depletion, renal vasoconstriction, direct proximal tubular injury, and tubular obstruction. Major causes of rhabdomyolysis include trauma, drugs and toxins, seizures, metabolic and electrolyte disorders, endocrinopathies (diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, hypothyroidism), and exercise. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and a history of predisposing factors (such as prolonged immobilization or drug toxicity) and confirmed by the presence of an elevated serum CK level (often >5000 U/L) and myoglobinuria (detected by a positive urine dipstick for blood in the absence of erythrocytes). Other possible laboratory manifestations may include hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment consists of aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation; fluids should be adjusted to maintain the hourly urine output of greater than 200 to 300 mL until the urine is negative for myoglobin. AKI resulting from acute tubular necrosis occurs in approximately one third of patients with rhabdomyolysis.

The initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule begins with measuring thyroid stimulating-hormone (TSH). TSH suppression is found with autonomously functioning or “hot” nodules, accounting for 5% to 10% of palpable thyroid nodules. Patients with thyroid nodules and a suppressed TSH are evaluated with thyroid scintigraphy. A radioactive isotope is administered, the percentage taken up by the thyroid is calculated (radioactive iodine uptake), and an image is obtained (thyroid scan). Hot nodules concentrate radioactive iodine to a greater extent than normal thyroid tissue. Autonomous hot nodules have a very low risk for malignancy and do not require fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Because multiple nodules were identified on neck ultrasonography, it is important to ascertain which of them are autonomous. Performing a radioactive iodine uptake and scan will help identify whether one or more of the nodules are responsible for the patient's thyroid function abnormalities."

Nodules identified as autonomously functioning (or hot) do not require fine-needle aspiration, whereas nodules that are either “cold” or “warm” (with uptake similar to that of the surrounding nonnodular thyroid tissue) may require cytologic evaluation. Performing an FNAB on the largest nodule may not be necessary if the nodule is autonomously functioning, and not performing an FNAB on the small nodule may miss a nonfunctioning nodule that might harbor thyroid cancer."

The lipophilic statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin) have a higher propensity to cause myopathy than the hydrophilic agents (pravastatin and rosuvastatin). The risk for myopathy increases with higher dosages, the addition of fenofibrate or gemfibrozil, and the addition of cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme inhibitors.

However, other risk factors, such as hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, opioids, chemotherapeutics agents, and immunomodulators, have been associated with colonic ischemia. In most instances, the precipitating factor remains unidentified. Most patients experience abdominal pain, tenesmus, and bloody diarrhea and follow a favorable course that requires only observation and supportive therapy. In severe cases, colonic gangrene, perforation, and peritonitis may occur; these patients require surgery and have a poor prognosis. Contrast abdominal CT may show circumferential colonic thickening, thumbprinting, and pericolonic fat stranding. The left colon is most frequently affected, particularly in areas of marginal blood flow (\"watershed\" areas), but any segment may be involved. Patients with right-sided colonic ischemia require noninvasive imaging of the mesenteric vasculature to exclude an occlusive process of the superior mesenteric artery. Colonoscopy, which allows diagnostic confirmation and collection of tissue samples, should be performed within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Common colonoscopic findings include hemorrhagic nodules, mucosal edema, and ulceration."

") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. He has hemodynamically stable narrow-complex tachycardia consistent with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The rhythm is regular, and no obvious P waves are visible on his ECG. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which accounts for up to two thirds of SVT, is the most likely cause. Patients often report neck pulsations, which are caused by simultaneous contraction of the atria and ventricles. The ventricular rate is generally between 120/min and 220/min. Vagal maneuvers block the atrioventricular (AV) node by increasing vagal tone and can help diagnose and treat SVT. Because the patient could not terminate his tachycardia with vagal maneuvers, adenosine should be administered. Adenosine is an endogenous nucleotide that is a short-acting blocker of AV node conduction. It is highly effective at termination of nodal-dependent rhythms and can help identify the underlying cause. For example, continued atrial activity (P waves) during AV block can help identify atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia. Patients given adenosine should be on a cardiac monitor with a running paper rhythm strip to document the results. Before taking adenosine, patients should be warned that they may experience nausea, flushing, chest pain, or a sense of dread. Patients with bronchospastic lung disease should not receive adenosine."

Diagnosis is based on clinical features, laboratory studies (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin), and ileocolonoscopic findings. Histology reveals patchy superficial ulcerations; unlike in ulcerative colitis, the rectum is usually unaffected. Microscopic granulomas support the diagnosis but are absent in most patients. More severe forms involve deeper layers of the bowel wall and lead to complications such as strictures and fistulas. Treatment of Crohn disease depends on its severity, location, and complications. Induction of remission in mild disease, particularly in the ileum and right colon, may be achieved with CIR budesonide, but maintenance therapy should be limited to 4 months. In more severe and extensive forms of Crohn disease, particularly those involving the left colon, systemic glucocorticoids may be used to induce remission but not to maintain it."

Damage to the small nerve fibers may result in pain, numbness, burning, and tingling and may impair light touch and temperature sensations. Damage to the large nerve fibers leads to abnormal vibration sensation and proprioception. Diminished or loss of ankle reflexes is commonly seen early with diabetic polyneuropathy. Motor weakness may occur as the polyneuropathy progresses. The goal of treatment of diabetic neuropathy is symptom control. The American Diabetes Association recommends duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin as initial therapy for neuropathic pain. The American Academy of Neurology recommends tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and sodium channel blockers. Of these agents, only pregabalin and duloxetine are FDA approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. The 8% capsaicin patch is FDA approved for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy of the feet. Opioids, tramadol, or tapentadol are not recommended. Few head-to-head comparison trials of these drugs for distal symmetric polyneuropathy exist; thus, selection must consider the potential risks and benefits associated with each drug for an individual patient. Duloxetine has fewer risks than a tricyclic antidepressant for this patient, given her cardiac history."

"). Anorexia, weight loss, and cachexia are common in advanced malignancy. Assuming potentially reversible conditions (nausea, altered taste, medication side effects, bowel obstruction, dysphagia, psychological comorbidities) have been excluded, disease-related cachexia is caused by an altered neurohormonal, inflammatory milieu that results in profound alterations in metabolism. These changes lead to decreased appetite and increased catabolism, which cause progressive weight loss. Patients often feel compelled to eat (despite discomfort) to ease distress experienced by family members and caregivers. Cachexia cannot be significantly reversed by more aggressive or invasive methods of nutritional support, including enteral (or parenteral) nutrition, and these interventions in the context of cachexia of advanced disease do not improve morbidity or mortality. Educating patients and families on the causes and pathophysiology of cachexia may help them better understand and accept the expected course of the disease and should ideally occur before anorexia and weight loss develop. Patients and families may benefit by shifting focus to social pleasures derived from eating even small quantities; maintaining quality of life should be the goal instead of gaining weight."

This diagnosis is based on a low serum osmolality and a urine osmolality that is inappropriately high relative to serum osmolality without evidence of hypovolemia. Although free water restriction is the recommended therapy for asymptomatic patients with SIADH, hypertonic saline is used to treat symptomatic patients. A typical goal for treating symptomatic hyponatremia is to increase the serum sodium level to approximately 120 mEq/L (120 mmol/L). Evidence suggests that an increase in the serum sodium level by approximately 4 to 6 mEq/L (4-6 mmol/L) over the first 24 hours is sufficient in symptomatic patients. If the extracellular fluid osmolality rapidly normalizes in a patient with chronic hyponatremia, neuronal cell shrinkage may occur and can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome."

The underlying syncopal mechanism, termed the neurocardiogenic or vasodepressor reflex, is a response of vasodilation, bradycardia, and systemic hypotension, which leads to transient hypoperfusion of the brain. Neurally mediated syncope includes vasovagal syncope, which is provoked by noxious stimuli, fear, stress, heat overexposure, or prolonged standing; situational syncope, which is triggered by cough, micturition, defecation, or deglutition; and carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is sometimes experienced during head rotation, shaving, or use of a tight-fitting neck collar. Prodromal symptoms, including nausea and diaphoresis, are classically present before neurally mediated syncope, and fatigue and generalized weakness are typically present afterward. Treatment of most types of situational syncope relies heavily on avoidance or elimination of a triggering event."

In women aged 30 to 65 years who want to lengthen the screening interval, primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing (preferred) or cytology combined with hrHPV testing can be performed every 5 years. The FDA has approved primary hrHPV tests as well as hrHPV tests to be used in combination with cervical cytology. The two categories of tests are not interchangeable. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening women younger than 21 years because screening has not been shown to reduce cervical cancer incidence or mortality. Screening can be discontinued at age 65 years in non–high-risk women with adequate prior screening, defined as three consecutive negative cytology results or two consecutive negative cytology plus HPV test results within the last 10 years, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years. In women older than 65 years with life expectancy of at least 10 years and risk factors for cervical cancer (history of abnormal Pap smears, history of a high-grade precancerous lesion, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, immunocompromise, previous HPV infection), continued screening should be considered. The American Cancer Society recommends initiating cervical cancer screening at age 25 years and performing primary HPV testing every 5 years through age 65 years (preferred); if primary HPV testing is not available, persons aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with cytology and hrHPV co-testing every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years."

There are two types of renovascular disease: (1) atherosclerotic renovascular disease and (2) fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease usually occurs in patients aged older than 45 to 55 years, especially in those with diffuse atherosclerosis, but it also can be isolated to the kidney. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic disorder that affects the mid and distal portions of the renal artery and usually occurs in young to middle-aged persons, particularly women (90%). Renovascular hypertension due to fibromuscular dysplasia is most commonly caused by medial fibroplasia of the renal artery. On angiography, the characteristic finding of fibromuscular dysplasia is the \"string of beads\" appearance of the involved artery. Hypertension usually affects patients between 15 and 30 years of age. Catheter-based renal angiography is the most accurate method to diagnose this condition. This study is indicated for patients whose clinical presentation raises strong suspicion for fibromuscular disease–related hypertension, such as those with severe resistant hypertension and high plasma renin activity. Revascularization with renal angioplasty may be performed at the same time as diagnostic angiography. The young age of many patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, such as this 32-year-old woman, reduces the risk for complications from this procedure."

Risk factors for rotator cuff disease include increasing age and participation in activities that require repetitive overhead arm use. This patient has worsened pain with overhead activities, pain with active abduction, and a positive painful arc test (complete passive abduction of arm with pain between 60 and 120 degrees) and empty can test. The empty can test is a maneuver where the extended arm is passively abducted to 90° in the plane of the supraspinatus (30° anterior to the coronal plane) and internally rotated (as though pouring a glass of water onto the floor). The patient is asked to maintain the position while the examiner exerts downward force on the arm. Weakness or reproduction of pain is a positive result. These findings are consistent with rotator cuff tendinopathy involving the supraspinatus tendon, which is the most commonly involved tendon in nontraumatic rotator cuff injury. Given the patient's classic presentation and examination findings, it is appropriate to diagnose him without further testing. Initial therapy typically includes rest, avoidance of aggravating activities, NSAIDs, and physical therapy to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles and improve flexibility."

For patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute ischemic stroke who are not eligible for thrombolysis or endovascular stroke therapy, antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of acute treatment. When administered either orally or rectally within 48 hours of stoke, aspirin reduces the short-term risk for recurrent stroke. Monotherapy with clopidogrel, however, has no established benefit in the acute stroke setting. Patients with TIA or minor stroke, usually defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 5 or less, have been the focus of recent trials of antiplatelet therapy because of their high short-term risk for recurrent events. Two trials examined the role of aspirin combined with clopidogrel versus monotherapy (with either aspirin or clopidogrel) initiated within 12 to 24 hours from symptom onset in patients with TIA or minor stroke. The studies used 21 or 90 days of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus single antiplatelet agents; overall, the combination therapy produced a small but significant reduction in risk for recurrence at 90 days. The risk for hemorrhagic complications seemed to increase beyond 30 days; DAPT with duration between 30 and 90 days is commonly used in minor stroke or TIA. On the basis of these studies, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends that DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) be initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset and continued for 21 days to reduce the 90-day risk for stroke. Long-term aspirin monotherapy is continued after 21 days of DAPT."

"). The evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) should include medical, psychosocial, and sexual components as well as noting the presence of early-morning and nocturnal spontaneous erections, which suggest a psychological cause. Physical examination should include cardiovascular, genital, digital rectal, peripheral vascular, and neurologic evaluations. Clinicians should pay close attention to reduced testicular volume, loss of normal body hair distribution, and gynecomastia, which suggest hypogonadism. Basic laboratory evaluation includes fasting glucose, lipid, morning testosterone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Given this patient's activity level and absence of cardiovascular risks, no further assessment for safe sexual activity is necessary. Appropriate lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss if needed, should be discussed first. Referral to behavioral health also should be considered for underlying mood disorder and psychosocial/interpersonal aspects of ED. First-line drug therapy is a PDE-5 inhibitor, such as tadalafil. PDE-5 inhibitors increase penile cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which facilitates smooth muscle relaxation and allows inflow of blood. An adequate trial is generally deemed to include gradual escalation of the dose to the maximum, with at least six attempts of maximum-dose therapy. PDE-5 inhibitors should be avoided in patients receiving any form of nitrate therapy. There is a risk for hearing loss with their use, and a rare complication is nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy characterized by acute, monocular, painless visual loss with optic disc swelling. Concomitant use of α-blockers may result in hypotension."

The anemia of kidney disease is usually normochromic and normocytic with a low or low-normal reticulocyte count. Patients with minor increases in serum creatinine levels may have reduced erythropoietin levels. Although this patient's creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 µmol/L), her estimated creatinine clearance (calculated by using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, based on age, creatinine level, and sex) is 46.7 mL/min, which corresponds to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend screening for anemia at least annually in patients with CKD stage 3. Before anemia is attributed to CKD, other potential causes of anemia should be eliminated. The typical evaluation includes complete blood count with erythrocyte indices, absolute reticulocyte count, serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity, percentage transferrin saturation, serum ferritin level, and serum vitamin B",

Risk factors include female sex (due to higher Q-angle in women); patellar instability; weakness of the quadriceps; and physical activities such as climbing stairs, running, and squatting. It is characterized by anterior knee pain and/or stiffness that is worse with knee flexion during weight-bearing activity such as climbing stairs, running, and squatting, but pain is also worse after prolonged flexion with sitting. On physical examination, applying pressure to the patella may reproduce pain. There is also exacerbation of pain with squatting, which has 91% sensitivity as a physical examination sign. NSAIDs may help alleviate symptoms in the acute setting but have not shown benefit in the long term. In the acute phase of injury, modification of activity and cryotherapy (ice, cold water immersion) is recommended. In the recovery phase, the most effective treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome is physical therapy with an exercise program designed to strengthen the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteus muscles. Core strengthening exercises may also have benefit."

") are the most appropriate next step in management. Diabetic retinopathy is a well-recognized microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus and is one of the leading causes of visual loss in adults in the United States. Diabetic retinopathy is classified as nonproliferative (with hard exudates, microaneurysms, and minor hemorrhages), which is not associated with visual decline, or as proliferative (with “cotton-wool spots” and neovascularization), which is associated with loss of vision. Changes in retinal blood flow occur after several years of diabetes. These changes cause retinal ischemia, which in turn promotes growth factors that stimulate proliferation of new blood vessels. This process leads to scarring and fibrosis. Fibrous tissue can put traction on the retina, which may cause retinal detachment with resultant vision loss. New vessels may also become more permeable and leak serum, which causes macular edema. Tight glycemic control, lipid lowering, and blood pressure reduction have been shown to decrease the incidence and progression of retinopathy. Once proliferative retinopathy is established, vision can be preserved by appropriately timed laser photocoagulation. Intraocular injection of an anti-VEGF agent (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept) has also been shown to be an effective treatment. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents provide a more effective treatment regimen for central-involved diabetic macular edema than monotherapy or even combination therapy with laser photocoagulation, and they are the preferred therapy."

OHS is typically diagnosed during an episode of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, characterized by dyspnea and somnolence. Frequent comorbidities include heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. This patient has severe obesity (BMI >40) and an elevated carbon dioxide level (62 mm Hg [8.3 kPa]) during wakefulness, the defining characteristics of OHS. Although OHS is a diagnosis of exclusion and further evaluation is warranted, it is the most likely cause of hypercapnic respiratory failure in this patient with no history of chronic lung disease. To establish the diagnosis, evaluation should exclude other causes of hypoventilation, including COPD, restrictive chest wall deformity, severe hypothyroidism, neuromuscular disease, and central hypoventilation syndromes. Positive pressure ventilation is often effective for treatment of hypoventilation. Weight loss, possibly including bariatric surgery, is recommended."

However, physicians have a duty to speak up because an impaired and disruptive colleague's behaviors may harm patients, negatively affect team morale, and impede learning. This physician's colleague manifests multiple behaviors suggestive of impairment, including altered mood, lapses in judgment, and changes in clinical performance. Because the physician has already directly confronted the colleague and the concerns were dismissed, the physician should report the impaired colleague to the appropriate supervisor, such as a chief of service, chief of staff, institutional or medical society assistance program, or state medical board."

Serum sickness may mimic exacerbation of various rheumatologic conditions. It is a type III hypersensitivity reaction mediated by complement-fixing antibodies against an immunogenic region of an external agent, usually a foreign protein or drug. Agents that may provoke a serum sickness–type reaction are antivenoms, antitoxins, streptokinase, several monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, infliximab), rabies vaccine, and insect venom. Similar reactions have been reported with the use of cefaclor, penicillins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Typical symptoms are a triad of fever, rash, and arthritis that occurs 7 to 14 days after exposure, such as in this patient. Other manifestations include glomerulonephritis, elevated inflammatory markers, and hypocomplementemia. It is vital to recognize the diagnosis of serum sickness because readministration of the inciting protein/medication often leads to a more severe reaction. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids is generally very effective at resolving a serum sickness reaction. This patient should not be rechallenged; the medication should be discontinued."

It is important to remember that naloxone has a very short half-life, and its antidote effects will usually wear off before the opioid effects are gone; patients should be observed for continued or recurrent signs of respiratory distress, which may require repeated dosing of naloxone.

") is the most likely cause of this patient's hypokalemia. She presents with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with extracellular volume depletion. This patient's history (generalized weakness and lightheadedness), physical examination findings (orthostatic hypotension), and urine electrolyte levels are most consistent with vomiting. Vomiting results in loss of hydrogen chloride and fluid from gastric secretions, and, if persistent, results in volume contraction. Hypovolemia activates the renin-angiotensin system with an increase in sodium-hydrogen exchange and increased bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule due to increased luminal hydrogen ion and exacerbated by decreased chloride available for reabsorption with sodium. Increased aldosterone secretion stimulates sodium-potassium exchange in the distal tubule, resulting in hypokalemia. This patient's urine electrolytes reflect these physiologic changes. With volume depletion, the urine sodium concentration is generally low (<20 mEq/L [20 mmol/L]) due to the kidney's conservation of sodium. However, in this case, excess filtered bicarbonate associated with the alkalosis is excreted through the renal tubule, and sodium is lost in the urine as an obligatory cation to maintain electroneutrality; this results in increased urine sodium excretion. Because of this, the urine chloride concentration more accurately determines volume status than the urine sodium concentration in metabolic alkalosis. The urine chloride concentration is low (<20 mEq/L [20 mmol/L]), reflecting gastrointestinal losses and prolonged volume contraction that leads to avid reabsorption of chloride with sodium."

Several studies have found that low-impact cardiovascular exercise (fast walking, biking, or swimming) can reduce pain, improve function, and may improve sleep. The exercise program should be individualized based on patient preference and any underlying comorbidities. Yoga and tai chi also have shown some benefit in managing pain and dysfunction in patients with fibromyalgia. Patients should be counseled to make gradual and modest increases in the amount and duration of exercise to avoid transient increases in pain and fatigue on initiation of an exercise program. Patients with fibromyalgia should be assessed for psychosocial stressors and psychiatric illness, including a history of trauma. If such stressors or illness is present, referral for psychological care is mandatory because psychic distress may both promote and result from fibromyalgia. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown modest benefit in reducing pain, negative mood, and disability."

"). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, with a prevalence of 10% to 15% in the general U.S. population. The Rome IV criteria for diagnosis of IBS require symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain at least 1 day per week for a period of 3 months, along with at least two of the following three criteria: pain related to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool consistency. Although multiple supplements and prescription medications have been used to treat IBS, the body of evidence in favor of some of those treatments is, at best, modest. Patients with IBS-D may benefit from dietary restrictions, including a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet. Prescription medications with FDA approval for treatment of IBS-D include rifaximin, eluxadoline, and alosetron. Other medications with clinical evidence for the treatment of IBS-D include loperamide, antispasmodics, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). This patient has tried all the aforementioned interventions except for a TCA. Based on data from several randomized trials, TCAs offer modest relief of the abdominal pain and global symptoms of IBS-D. The American Gastroenterological Association has given a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence for the use of TCAs in the treatment of IBS-D."

") is a quality improvement model that improves processes by identifying and removing causes of error and minimizing variability in patient care. The term Six Sigma is derived from statistical quality control measures in manufacturing processes and refers to a process that delivers nearly perfect production quality. The Six Sigma model achieves quality improvement by implementing several methods, including the stepwise DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) process. The Define step of DMAIC involves developing the objectives of the project. In the Measure step, baseline data on the number and types of defects within the system are measured. The Analyze stage uses the data collected to determine the magnitude of the effects. The Improve step involves implementation of tools to improve the process. Finally, in the Control phase, future processes are controlled to sustain the gains. Six Sigma may be applied to complex, multistep health care processes, such as the ordering and administration of high-risk medications like chemotherapy, to decrease medication errors. Six Sigma may be too cumbersome and complex to address inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the emergency department."

Varicella-zoster virus can be transmitted from persons with zoster to susceptible hosts (i.e., those who have never had chickenpox and are not vaccinated against it), who may develop chickenpox as a result of the exposure. The virus can spread through direct contact with active lesions, which is most common with localized zoster. Localized zoster is defined as rash in one or two dermatomes (most commonly along a thoracic dermatome) that does not cross the midline. Patients with localized zoster who are not immunocompromised can be managed with contact precautions alone; a person is no longer infectious after all the lesions have crusted over. Disseminated zoster is defined as a more widespread rash involving three or more dermatomes; it may appear similar to varicella (chickenpox). Vesicles usually appear in various stages of development and generally form over 3 to 5 days before they start to dry and crust over. Immunocompromised persons (such as this patient) are at increased risk for disseminated zoster, which may involve the respiratory tract. In patients with disseminated zoster or those who are immunocompromised, the virus may be transmitted via the airborne route from infected small (≤5 microns) respiratory droplet nuclei that can remain suspended for extended periods or travel long distances on air currents. Airborne (negative-pressure room; health care personnel [HCP] wear fit-tested N95 respirators) and contact precautions (single room; gloves and gown for HCP entering room) are appropriate infection control measures for patients who have disseminated zoster or localized zoster and are immunocompromised."

Such testing should be reserved for patients in whom a serious underlying condition is suspected, those with severe or progressive neurologic deficits, or patients without symptom improvement after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative management. As this patient's pain meets the definition of nonspecific low back pain, no additional imaging or testing is indicated before initiating therapy."
