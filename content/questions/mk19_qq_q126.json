"), a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. She has acute and disabling neurologic deficits consistent with an ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery territory, with no evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarct on head CT. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardioembolic cause of stroke and is the most likely cause of this patient's stroke. She is within the 3-hour treatment window for patients who do not meet any exclusion criteria for thrombolysis and should receive this treatment. Patients who receive alteplase within 3 hours of stroke onset have a greater likelihood of clinical improvement at 3 months compared with nontreated patients. In addition, patients who present within 3 to 4.5 hours of stroke onset and fulfill additional criteria may also benefit from alteplase, but it is not FDA approved for this population. The main complication of alteplase is symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, which may present with headache or clinical deterioration. The main risk factors for symptomatic hemorrhage are treatment after 4.5 hours and hypertension before and after treatment. Accordingly, before treatment with alteplase, the patient's blood pressure should be less than 185/110 mm Hg. Higher readings should prompt administration of IV labetalol or nicardipine before alteplase, and blood pressure should be kept below 180/105 mm Hg after treatment."

"For patients with acute ischemic stroke who are not eligible for alteplase or endovascular stroke therapy, antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of acute treatment.
