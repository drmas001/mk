"A 68-year-old man is evaluated for increasingly frequent angina. One month ago, coronary angiography was performed because of the occurrence of angina at lower levels of exertion. It showed diffuse coronary disease without lesions amenable to revascularization and preserved left ventricular function. Following coronary angiography, the patient increased his dosage of isosorbide mononitrate to twice daily; however, his exertional chest discomfort worsened. He also has hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Previously, diltiazem was substituted for metoprolol because of intolerance. Medications are aspirin, metformin, liraglutide, atorvastatin, lisinopril, diltiazem, and isosorbide mononitrate."

") is the most appropriate management. Nitrates improve myocardial oxygen delivery through coronary vasodilation and decrease oxygen consumption by reducing preload. They are an important component of anginal symptom control. Long-acting nitrates, such as isosorbide mononitrate and patch formulations, provide a constant level of vasodilation and symptom relief throughout the day. However, a nitrate-free interval of 8 to 12 hours daily is required to avoid nitrate tolerance, the clinically apparent effect of prolonged nitrate exposure reducing nitrate efficacy. This patient has experienced an increase in anginal symptoms with an increase of isosorbide mononitrate to twice-daily dosing, and the most reasonable next step is to decrease the frequency of administration to once daily to restore a nitrate-free interval and nitrate's beneficial effects on blood pressure and symptoms."
