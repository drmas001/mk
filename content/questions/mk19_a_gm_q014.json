"). In patients with syncope, the presence of high-risk clinical characteristics should prompt consideration of hospitalization. This patient has several risk factors that are associated with a higher 30-day mortality rate (male sex, age >60 years, no syncopal prodrome, concern for structural heart disease based on clinical examination findings, and syncope during exertion). Other symptoms or findings on the history and physical examination that indicate a need for inpatient evaluation include cardiac arrhythmias (sustained or symptomatic ventricular tachycardia); symptomatic or high-risk bradycardia or heart block; pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator malfunction; other structural heart abnormalities, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; or severe anemia."

"When cardiac syncope is suspected, the evaluation should be tailored to the specific concern. Electrophysiology consultation can be useful for suspected arrhythmias. For patients with exertional syncope, cardiac stress testing may help to evaluate for ischemia. In this case, echocardiography is warranted to evaluate for severe aortic stenosis, given the history of a syncopal event and the physical examination findings (late-peaking systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border)."

Patients with neurally mediated syncope can receive a limited evaluation, including physical examination and ECG; all findings are typically normal."
