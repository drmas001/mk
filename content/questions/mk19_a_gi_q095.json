"). The patient is mostly asymptomatic and has normal physical examination and laboratory findings. However, her celiac disease status is uncertain because she has been maintaining a gluten-free diet for the past year without having been tested for celiac disease. Her clinical improvement after starting a gluten-free diet may be due to celiac disease or to nonceliac gluten sensitivity, a clinical syndrome of unknown pathophysiology. Because gluten-containing foods can also contain nonabsorbable carbohydrates, such as fructans, they can cause gastrointestinal symptoms due to osmotic mechanisms, as well as fermentation by colonic bacteria. By definition, celiac disease must first be excluded before nonceliac gluten sensitivity is diagnosed. Although the tissue transglutaminase IgA level is normal, the patient's gluten-free diet reduces the sensitivity of this serologic test. Celiac disease testing should therefore be repeated while the patient is on a gluten-containing diet; gluten should be reintroduced daily, preferably for 1 to 3 months before testing."

") from the duodenum to confirm the disease. If biopsy results suggesting celiac disease are obtained before serologic testing, confirmatory serologic testing should be performed. Findings on upper endoscopy and biopsy may be normal in a patient with celiac disease who has adhered to a gluten-free diet for the past year. Therefore, the most appropriate management is resumption of a gluten-containing diet and follow-up serologic testing."
