"). The nephrotic syndrome is a hypercoagulable state due to urinary losses of anticoagulant proteins (antithrombin III, protein S) and fibrinolytics as well as hepatic overproduction of procoagulant proteins (factor V, factor VIII, fibrinogen). A very low serum albumin level seems to be a surrogate measure for abnormalities in antithrombin and fibrinogen. As a result, patients with the nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk for lower extremity, pulmonary, and renal vein thrombosis. Clots are most often seen in patients with membranous nephropathy, such as this patient, in which VTE risk appears to begin at a serum albumin level <2.8 g/dL (28 g/L) and increases proportionately with declining albumin levels. Therefore, any patient with nephrotic-range proteinuria and significant hypoalbuminemia (typically <2.5 g/dL [25 g/L]) should be considered at risk. Most VTE events occur in the first 6 months after a diagnosis of the nephrotic syndrome is made. Prophylactic anticoagulation of asymptomatic patients with the nephrotic syndrome and hypoalbuminemia is controversial, and no randomized clinical trials are available to help guide clinical decision-making."
