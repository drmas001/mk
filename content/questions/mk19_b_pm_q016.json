"). The patient most likely has stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis, a granulomatous disease of unknown cause that can affect any organ system but most commonly affects the lungs. Many patients are asymptomatic, and lung involvement is found incidentally on a chest radiograph obtained for other reasons. Pulmonary sarcoidosis is classified into four stages based on appearance on chest radiograph: stage I, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; stage II, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with pulmonary infiltrates; stage III, parenchymal infiltrates alone; and stage IV, pulmonary fibrosis with parenchymal distortion or bullae. For patients with stage I disease, clinical diagnosis based on a classic presentation is a cost-effective strategy, with pretest probability approaching 99.95%. The overall prognosis of stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis is excellent, with spontaneous regression of radiographic abnormalities observed in most patients."

"), with tissue obtained from a lymph node or from the pulmonary parenchyma. The diagnosis is made by the finding of noncaseating granulomas with exclusion of potential mimicking infections (mycobacteria, fungi), exclusion of other systemic granulomatous diseases, and involvement of more than one organ system. The absence of respiratory and constitutional symptoms makes infectious and malignant causes unlikely. Clinical presentations of sarcoidosis that do not require a biopsy include asymptomatic stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis (absence of fevers, malaise, or night sweats to suggest a malignancy); Löfgren syndrome (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, migratory polyarthralgia, erythema nodosum, and fever); and Heerfordt syndrome (anterior uveitis, parotiditis, fever, and facial nerve palsy). This asymptomatic patient with stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis does not need a bronchoscopic biopsy."

Treatment with prednisone would not be the most appropriate initial treatment for this asymptomatic patient with stage I disease."
