") is needed to screen for erythrocytosis. Erythrocytosis (hematocrit >50%) is a known risk of testosterone therapy, and current guidelines for transgender males taking testosterone recommend hematocrit or hemoglobin measurement before starting therapy, every 3 months for the first year, then annually or semiannually. Testosterone levels should be maintained in the physiologic normal male range (320-800 ng/dL [11-28 nmol/L]) to reduce the risk for adverse events such as erythrocytosis, sleep apnea, hypertension, excessive weight gain, sodium retention, lipid changes, and cystic acne. Testosterone therapy should be reduced or the method of delivery changed if erythrocytosis occurs. In cases of severe and refractory erythrocytosis, therapy may need to be discontinued."

"Hyperprolactinemia and hyperkalemia are known complications of feminizing hormone therapy (estrogen and spironolactone therapy, respectively), not testosterone. Estrogen can increase the growth of pituitary lactotroph cells, and prolactinomas have been reported in transgender females on long-term, high-dose estrogen therapy. Current guidelines recommend periodically monitoring prolactin levels (",

") should be monitored in genetic males taking testosterone therapy to treat hypogonadism because testosterone therapy can accelerate prostate cancer cell growth. Transgender males do not have a prostate; therefore, PSA monitoring is not needed in this population. Current practice guidelines recommend that cancer screening for transgender persons be based on the person's anatomy and risk factors. If cervical tissue is present, screening should be performed as recommended by current guidelines. If mastectomy is performed, annual sub- and peri-areolar breast examinations should be performed. If the patient has not had a mastectomy, screening mammography should be performed as recommended by current guidelines."
