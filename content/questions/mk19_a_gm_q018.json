"A 49-year-old man is evaluated for increasing abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium. He was diagnosed 6 weeks ago with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. He rates his pain intensity as 7 out of 10 and reports that it is now interfering with sleep. After his diagnosis, he was started on immediate-release morphine sulfate and noted an initial reduction in his pain. Over the past 2 weeks, he reports taking an average of five to six doses per day, waking up from sleep with pain, and noticing significant escalation of his pain 3 hours after a dose. He also takes polyethylene glycol."

"). The patient is experiencing escalating pain in the setting of known metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. He was started on appropriate immediate-release opioid therapy for severe cancer-associated pain and is now experiencing end-dose failure, which should prompt the initiation of a sustained-release opioid while continuing the short-acting opioid for breakthrough pain flares. Because the patient is currently tolerating morphine, there is no reason to change to an alternative opioid. In addition, nonopioid adjuvant therapies should be considered for this patient; he would benefit from an evaluation for targeted interventional options by a pain medicine specialist."

") is commonly used as an adjuvant in the treatment of bony cancerâ€“associated pain and neuropathic pain. The primary analgesic mode of action may be modulation of the descending pain pathway through inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake, as well as serotonergic and dopaminergic effects. However, the onset to efficacy is at least 1 week, and the best next step in the setting of metastatic cancer is to increase the patient's current opioid regimen with a basal analgesic agent."
