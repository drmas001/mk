The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends brief screening for depression in all adults by using a validated instrument, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2. If the patient answers positively to one of the two questions on the PHQ-2 or if the patient has symptoms suggestive of depression, more comprehensive assessment using a validated screening tool, such as the PHQ-9, should be performed. The PHQ-9 has robust sensitivity and specificity for detecting (or excluding) depression and assessing the severity of depression, if present. The PHQ-9 additionally includes questions intended to screen for suicidal ideation. This patient has insomnia, decreased energy, decreased concentration, and loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities; these are all symptoms of depression that should be evaluated further."

Although melatonin is often recommended, especially to older adults owing to the lower risk for side effects, there is insufficient evidence to support its use. However, this patient's insomnia, in combination with reported changes in energy level and concentration, suggest that his sleep-related symptoms may represent undiagnosed depression, and screening and treating depression is preferred to treating a symptom of depression."
