Myalgia, sore throat, maculopapular rash, and cough are common symptoms in addition to typical meningitis symptoms.

") is a mosquito-borne illness that may present with a similar clinical and CSF profile to other causes of viral meningitis and occurs between June and October. West Nile may present with meningitis, encephalitis, or a combination of the two, or as an isolated myelitis. Isolated meningitis is more common in children. In its most severe form, infection of the anterior horn cells can cause a symmetric or asymmetric flaccid paralysis, analogous to that seen with polio. Patients with neuroinvasive disease may also have a maculopapular rash and a flu-like syndrome before neurologic disease onset, but it remains an uncommon cause of viral meningitis compared with enterovirus infection. The diagnosis of West Nile neuroinvasive disease can be confirmed through identification of the IgM antibody in CSF or the serum."
