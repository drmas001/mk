"The patient's lower extremity findings are most consistent with chronic venous insufficiency and stasis dermatitis. This patient has evidence of chronic vascular congestion, as seen by the \"sock sign,\" a circumferential indentation on the right lower extremity caused by compression of edema by the elastic band in socks. Other changes consistent with chronic venous insufficiency demonstrated in this image include erythema, areas of hyperpigmentation, and trophic skin changes at the upper portion of the calves. Chronic venous insufficiency usually results from incompetence of venous valves in the lower extremities, causing hypertension in dependent areas and leading to increased vascular permeability, edema, and the release of inflammatory mediators. Stasis dermatitis is a late manifestation of chronic venous disease and usually presents with scaling and eczematous patches that, when acutely inflamed, may weep and crust; this makes it difficult to differentiate stasis dermatitis from bacterial superinfection. Early stasis dermatitis is most commonly confused with cellulitis but is a significantly more likely diagnosis than cellulitis in patients presenting with bilateral erythema and swelling of the legs."
