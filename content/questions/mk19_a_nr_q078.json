"). The patient has asymptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) of less than 80%, and neither surgical intervention nor further imaging is indicated. Patients with ICA stenosis less than 80% have a low annual risk for stroke (likely <1%), and the risk associated with surgical intervention is higher. The patient should be treated with the best medical therapy to prevent further progression; the use of a high-intensity statin in patients with dyslipidemia is especially indicated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend screening for carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening (mainly related to subsequent interventions, such as carotid artery endarterectomy) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis outweigh the benefits."

Carotid revascularization can be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients with greater than 80% asymptomatic ICA stenosis when surgical risk for stroke is less than 3%, although these patients are recommended for enrollment in an NIH-funded clinical trial. Patients with stenosis greater than 80% and other high-risk features can be considered for surgical intervention; such features include rapid progression or presence of hemodynamic failure seen on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography or cerebral blood flow measures."

CT angiography can be considered in patients with greater than 80% stenosis, particularly if surgical intervention is being considered, to confirm the degree of stenosis seen on ultrasound and to outline anatomic features that may help in choosing between stenting and endarterectomy."
