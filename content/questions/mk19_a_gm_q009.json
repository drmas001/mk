"A 39-year-old man is evaluated for depression. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, which was treated with subtotal resection, radiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. The average life expectancy for patients with this tumor is 1.5 to 3 years. He describes depressed mood, anhedonia, difficulty with sleep initiation, fatigue, and difficultly with concentration that have persisted for the past month and significantly affected his quality of his life. He also reports feeling as if he is a burden to his family, along with pervasive worry and anxiety. His medications are temozolomide and levetiracetam."

"). Although grief and a period of adjustment are common for a few days to a few weeks after a cancer diagnosis, this patient shows symptoms of clinical depression, including sleep disruption and persistent feelings of guilt and burden. Neurovegetative symptoms, such as appetite loss and low energy level, are also common in the setting of depression, but these symptoms may overlap with or be caused in part by the patient's underlying cancer and/or cancer treatment, making these diagnostic criteria less specific in patients with advanced disease. Depression negatively affects quality of life and should be treated promptly in patients with serious illness. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is effective in the treatment of depression. Sertraline carries less risk for secondary orthostatic hypotension than other agents and is available in a liquid formulation, making it a good option for the treatment of depression in patients with advanced serious illness. Once initiated, sertraline should be titrated to effect, with close monitoring for adverse effects, such as diarrhea."

") is a second-generation antipsychotic that is often used to treat nausea in patients with advanced cancer. Olanzapine has a diverse neurotransmitter profile, targeting dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors. It is also effective in the treatment of resistant depression as an adjuvant medication and may be effective in the treatment of psychotic depression. This patient has not yet tried first-line treatment for depression, and olanzapine would not be the best initial agent."
