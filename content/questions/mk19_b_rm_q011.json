For the past 6 months, she has had four or five bowel movements daily and over the past month she has experienced unintentional weight loss of 3 kg (6.6 lb). The abdominal pain is poorly localized and unrelated to defecation. Stools are loose but not greasy, mucoid, or bloody. She has been taking naproxen twice daily, with good control of her ankylosing spondylitis. She reports no recent travel or antibiotic therapy. She has no other medical problems and takes no additional medications."

"). IBD occurs in up to 14% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a much higher rate than the approximately 0.5% seen in the general population. Among patients with AS who develop IBD, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis occur with equal frequency. IBD in AS is slightly more common among men and occurs early in the course of AS. By 10 years of AS, the risk for IBD has returned to the general population level. The bowel inflammation and gut dysbiosis that are common in IBD may drive the inflammation in the spine, leading to AS. Clinical manifestations of IBD in patients with combined AS and IBD are similar to those in patients with IBD alone."

The diagnosis of IBS requires symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain at least 1 day a week for 3 months, along with at least two of the following three additional criteria: pain related to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool consistency. This patient's pain is not related to defecation, and her recent unintentional weight loss makes IBS unlikely."
