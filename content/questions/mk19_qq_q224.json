"). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening women aged 21 to 65 years every 3 years with cytology (Pap testing). In women aged 30 to 65 years who want to lengthen the screening interval, primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing (preferred) or cytology combined with hrHPV testing can be performed every 5 years. The FDA has approved primary hrHPV tests as well as hrHPV tests to be used in combination with cervical cytology. The two categories of tests are not interchangeable. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening women younger than 21 years because screening has not been shown to reduce cervical cancer incidence or mortality. Screening can be discontinued at age 65 years in nonâ€“high-risk women with adequate prior screening, defined as three consecutive negative cytology results or two consecutive negative cytology plus HPV test results within the last 10 years, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years. In women older than 65 years with life expectancy of at least 10 years and risk factors for cervical cancer (history of abnormal Pap smears, history of a high-grade precancerous lesion, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, immunocompromise, previous HPV infection), continued screening should be considered. The American Cancer Society recommends initiating cervical cancer screening at age 25 years and performing primary HPV testing every 5 years through age 65 years (preferred); if primary HPV testing is not available, persons aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with cytology and hrHPV co-testing every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years."
