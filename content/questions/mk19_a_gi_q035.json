"). This patient likely has nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) given the presence of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Diabetes is associated with the development of NAFLD, including its more severe manifestations of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Elevations of hepatic aminotransferase concentrations are associated with higher BMI, waist circumference, and triglyceride levels and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and elevated liver enzyme levels or fatty liver on ultrasound should be evaluated for presence of NASH and liver fibrosis. An NAFLD fibrosis score calculator or fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score is used to identify patients at risk for severe disease. Patients with low fibrosis scores are classified as low risk and are managed with weight loss and lifestyle modifications. Patients with indeterminate fibrosis scores should undergo liver stiffness measurement with transient elastography; patients with low liver stiffness are managed as low risk, whereas patients with indeterminate or high-risk stiffness should be managed by a hepatologist. Patients with a high NAFLD fibrosis score or FIB-4 score should be referred to hepatology for consideration of liver stiffness measurement or liver biopsy. The mainstay of NAFLD management for all patients is weight loss. Weight loss of at least 5% improves steatosis, whereas weight loss of 8% to 10% improves steatohepatitis and fibrosis. No specific diet for NAFLD is recommended. Bariatric surgery and concomitant weight loss improve inflammation and fibrosis associated with NAFLD."
