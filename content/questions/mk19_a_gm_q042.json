"). In the case of acute unilateral lower extremity edema, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) must be considered. The pretest probability of DVT is useful in determining the next steps for testing and treatment. The Wells score and modified Wells score are commonly used to determine pretest probability and are widely available. This patient has a moderate pretest probability of DVT based on the presence of calf swelling at least 3 cm greater than the opposite leg, and there is no alternative explanation for the symptoms that is more likely than DVT. If there is a high pretest probability of DVT, ultrasonography should be performed as the first step. When there is a low or moderate pretest probability, D-dimer testing should be performed. If the D-dimer result is negative, no further testing needs to be completed. If the result is positive or elevated, duplex ultrasonography to look for lower extremity DVT should be performed. If ultrasonography findings are positive, the patient should be treated for DVT."

However, edema due to CVI does not present acutely; is typically bilateral; and is often associated with other findings of CVI, such as varicose veins and hyperpigmentation, particularly on the medial aspect of the lower leg. This patient requires investigation for DVT rather than compression therapy for CVI."
