") are the most severe and deadly of the cutaneous adverse drug reactions. SJS/TEN overlap syndrome refers to patients with 10% to 30% body surface area affected. Symptoms begin usually within 1 to 3 weeks of exposure to an inciting agent, such as carbamazepine, with fever and malaise followed by skin pain, grittiness or sand-like irritation of the eyes, and odynophagia. Shortly thereafter, patients develop red or purple dusky macules on the trunk that progress to vesicles, erosion, and ulceration. Painful erosions develop in the mouth, eyes, or genitals in as many as 95% of patients. Mortality is high, with 5% to 10% of SJS cases being fatal."

") refers to the rapid onset of a pustular rash after a medication exposure. Onset may be as soon as 1 day after exposure to the medication or a few days at most.

The onset of this patient's rash 12 days after initiation of carbamazepine and lack of pustules argue against AGEP."

") is also a severe life-threatening medication reaction. Unlike other severe medication reactions, the onset of symptoms is delayed, often 2 to 6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms begin with fever and flulike symptoms, quickly followed by burning skin pain and rash. Patients typically develop a morbilliform exanthem that starts on the face and upper trunk and spreads distally. Eventually, the patient develops striking facial edema and redness, a hallmark of DIHS. Oral mucosal involvement is common. The onset of this patient's rash 12 days after initiation of carbamazepine and lack of a morbilliform rash and facial edema argue against DIHS."
