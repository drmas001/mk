"). Maintenance of mobility in MS patients is essential to maintaining quality of life. An active healthy lifestyle is necessary to help stave off future disability. Physical and occupational therapy can provide gait safety training and improve balance and endurance. Assistive devices, such as braces, canes, walkers, and electrostimulatory walk-assist devices, can provide additional benefit. This patient's left leg findings are consistent with injury to the corticospinal tract from a prior relapse. Dalfampridine, an oral voltage-gated potassium channel antagonist, can improve gait speed and endurance in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) with ambulatory dysfunction. Dalfampridine cannot induce healing or remyelination. However, this medication likely improves neuronal conduction, allowing signals to be processed through the corticospinal tract more efficiently and thus leading to improvements in gait in those with injury to this tract. Dalfampridine has a rare risk of seizures and should not be used in patients with known epilepsy or with kidney impairment."

Altering this patient's disease-modifying therapy would thus not help improve his gait, which has been affected for 1 year."
