"). Hepatic adenomas are benign neoplasms that often are found incidentally. They can be differentiated from focal nodular hyperplasia by abdominal MRI with gadoxetate sodium. This contrast agent is excreted in the bile ducts and therefore clarifies the presence of a hepatic adenoma, which does not typically excrete bile. Most hepatic adenomas are found in women (and are eight times more common than in men), particularly those using oral contraceptive agents. Factors posing an increased risk for malignant transformation of hepatic adenomas include adenomas greater than 5 cm in diameter and adenomas with β-catenin activation. Adenomas in men commonly have β-catenin activation; therefore, surgical resection of adenomas found in men is recommended."

In patients with hepatic adenomas, liver biopsy can clarify the expression of β-catenin. Because adenomas that express activated β-catenin are at increased risk for malignancy, liver biopsy is potentially useful if surgical resection is being considered. In this patient, whose risk for malignancy is already increased because he is male, liver biopsy is not necessary."
