"). The salivary glands include the major (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual) salivary glands and thousands of minor salivary glands. Decreased salivary gland flow can predispose to the formation of salivary gland stones. Risk factors include hypovolemia, use of diuretics or anticholinergic medications, smoking, chronic periodontal disease, and a history of nephrolithiasis. Salivary gland stones may present as acute pain and swelling in anticipation of eating or during eating. Often the pain and swelling are transient but can be persistent. A stone may be palpable in a major duct. Wharton duct of the submandibular gland is found along the floor of the mouth. Stensen duct of the parotid gland opens opposite the second upper molar. Treatment is hydration and stimulation of salivary flow with warm compresses and sialagogues (sour candies or vitamin C lozenges), salivary gland massage, increased fluid intake, and improved oral hygiene."

") is an autoimmune exocrinopathy affecting salivary and lacrimal glands. It is more prevalent in women and commonly presents in the fourth and fifth decades. Primary Sjögren syndrome occurs in isolation; secondary Sjögren syndrome occurs in the setting of other rheumatologic diseases, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common presentation of Sjögren syndrome is sicca, consisting of dryness of the eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and mouth (xerostomia). Patients report gritty eyes or a foreign body sensation. Oral dryness can cause caries and difficulty eating dry food. Symmetric parotid and lacrimal swelling is common, as is skin and vaginal dryness. This patient's onset of symptoms with eating and a palpable mass within the left submandibular duct are not consistent with Sjögren syndrome."
