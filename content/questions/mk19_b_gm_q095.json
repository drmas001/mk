"). This patient presents with the characteristic erythema and blistering of a phototoxic drug reaction. Phototoxic drug reactions usually present as exaggerated sunburn due to direct cellular injury. Unlike photoallergic reactions, they are not immunologically mediated and do not require prior sensitization; reactions occur minutes to hours after sun exposure. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are one of the most common causes of phototoxic drug reactions. In addition to exaggerated sunburn, tetracycline-induced phototoxicity may present with photo-onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed) and pseudoporphyria. Minocycline may cause less photosensitization than other tetracyclines. Other common causes of phototoxic reactions include sulfonamides, hydrochlorothiazide, fluoroquinolones, antimalarials, amiodarone, and voriconazole. Discontinuation of the photosensitizing drug and sun avoidance measures will lead to resolution of the reaction. Topical glucocorticoids can be used for symptomatic treatment."

This type of drug reaction typically presents more than 24 hours after exposure. It clinically presents as eczematous dermatitis and less commonly as exaggerated sunburn. Although many drugs can cause both a phototoxic and photoallergic drug reaction, doxycycline is not known to cause a photoallergic drug reaction."
