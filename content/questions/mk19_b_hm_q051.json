MGUS is characterized by an M protein level less than 3 g/dL (or less than 500 mg/24 h of urinary monoclonal free light chains [FLCs]), clonal plasma cells comprising less than 10% of the bone marrow cellularity, and the absence of related signs and symptoms of end-organ damage. The patient's serum hemoglobin, calcium, and creatinine levels are normal, and she has no skeletal lesions. The chance of progression to multiple myeloma or a lymphoproliferative disorder depends on risk factors. Because her monoclonal protein spike is less than 1.5 g/dL, and the serum FLCs are normal, her risk of progression is low (5% over 20 years). Patients with MGUS commonly undergo follow-up for signs and symptoms of progression, initially at 6 months and then yearly if stable."
