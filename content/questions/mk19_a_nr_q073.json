She has otherwise been well and reports no other symptoms. She received an influenza vaccination a month ago. She takes no medications."

"). This patient with rapidly progressive dysesthesia, weakness, and areflexia after recent vaccination likely has Guillain-Barré syndrome. Onset is often preceded by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, triggering a T-cell–mediated autoimmune attack against peripheral nerve and root myelin. A very few patients develop Guillain-Barré syndrome after immunization, surgery, or trauma. The weakness may occur first in the proximal muscles. Paresthesia and early low back pain are common. Dysautonomia can be severe and predispose patients to labile blood pressure and arrhythmias. Progressive respiratory and bulbar weakness may lead to rapid respiratory failure. Both plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are equally effective and appropriate options in this setting. The combination of plasma exchange and immunoglobulin therapy is no more effective than treatment with either modality alone. Although albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein level with a normal or mildly elevated leukocyte count) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy on electromyography are characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome, these findings may be absent early in the course of disease; the tests may need to be repeated later if diagnostic uncertainty persists. However, treatment should not be delayed for confirmatory testing. In this patient with characteristic symptoms and normal findings on spinal imaging and CSF cell count, the most likely diagnosis is Guillain-Barré syndrome and treatment should be initiated."
