Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan performed 2 years ago showed low bone mineral density (BMD). Alendronate weekly was initiated after the scan, and he has been adherent to therapy. Review for secondary causes of osteoporosis is negative. DEXA reassessment shows no significant change in BMD."

"Despite a lack of evidence, BMD is commonly performed to serve as an indicator of response to osteoporosis treatment. However, BMD response to treatment varies by skeletal site, drug used, and patient-specific clinical context. In a patient with an incident fracture during therapy, some groups recommend reassessment of BMD to detect bone loss caused by treatment nonadherence or secondary causes of osteoporosis. If subsequent testing in a given patient is performed, it must be performed at the same facility using the same machine as the previous study. Reporting should include locally determined least significant change thresholds for each measurement site. Interpretation should not compare current to past T-scores but rather focus on significant change or no change in percentage of g/cm",

"The failure to suppress bone turnover markers such as crosslinks of type 1 collagen (C-telopeptide and N-telopeptide) has been suggested to reflect treatment failure in osteoporosis. However, limited evidence exists to support routine use of biochemical markers. In addition, fracture healing results in locally increased bone turnover; an increase in C-telopeptide levels in this patient with a recent fracture would not necessarily reflect a lack of antiresorptive treatment effect on the remaining skeleton. Therefore, measurement of serum C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (",
