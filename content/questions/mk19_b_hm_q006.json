"). This patient has acute chest syndrome (ACS), which develops as a result of vaso-occlusion in the pulmonary microvasculature. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), ACS should be considered and treatment begun in those presenting with fever, hypoxia, chest pain, and new consolidation on radiographic imaging because patients can rapidly deteriorate and develop multiorgan failure. ACS is the leading cause of death in patients with sickle cell anemia; although patients with all types of SCD can develop ACS, rates are highest in those with hemoglobin SS disease. Treatment consists of supportive measures, including analgesia and supplemental oxygen, with many patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Because ACS shares many clinical features with pneumonia and can be triggered by infection, empiric antibiotic therapy for pneumonia is considered accepted care. However, erythrocyte transfusion is the main treatment intervention. Simple transfusion can be used for milder presentations, but exchange transfusion is recommended for more severe forms. The posttransfusion target hemoglobin S is less than 30% and target hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (100 g/L)."
