"). This patient most likely has postrenal obstructive uropathy secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the recent introduction of chlorpheniramine, a drug with anticholinergic properties. Postrenal acute kidney injury (AKI) results from urinary tract obstruction. If left uncorrected, the elevated tubular pressure can cause chronic and end-stage kidney disease. Postrenal obstruction due to bladder outlet obstruction should be suspected in patients with a history of BPH and diabetes mellitus (neurogenic bladder). Symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction may include abdominal fullness or pain; urinary frequency, urgency, and hesitancy; nocturia; and incomplete voiding. The diagnosis is supported by a distended bladder and prostate enlargement on physical examination. In postrenal obstruction, urine sediment is often unremarkable, but microscopic hematuria may be present. Bladder outlet obstruction is confirmed by an elevated postvoid residual bladder volume by ultrasonography. If the obstruction is relieved within 1 to 2 weeks, recovery of kidney function is excellent."

"Obstruction of the upper tract (ureters or renal pelvis) must be bilateral to cause AKI (unless obstruction occurs in a single kidney); causes may include nephrolithiasis, abdominal or pelvic surgeries or radiation, pelvic malignancies, or retroperitoneal fibrosis or lymphadenopathy.
