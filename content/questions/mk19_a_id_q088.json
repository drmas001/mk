". Symptoms of cryptosporidiosis usually last less than 2 weeks before spontaneously resolving in immunocompetent hosts. Immunocompromised patients, in particular patients with AIDS, can develop serious and prolonged infection. Despite supportive care, including an antimotility agent and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), this patient with HIV infection has persistent and frequent diarrhea. In general, immune reconstitution with combination ART is the cornerstone of management for patients with HIV-associated cryptosporidiosis. However, symptom resolution, which typically occurs at significantly higher CD4 cell counts (>100/µL), may be delayed, so patients with persistent and debilitating diarrhea can be given nitazoxanide. If uncontrolled, particularly in persons with advanced HIV disease, cryptosporidiosis can cause profound wasting, with associated malaise, crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Patients treated for cryptosporidial diarrhea should avoid swimming in public pools for 2 weeks after the diarrhea has resolved. This parasite is tolerant to chlorine and can persist for days in a chlorinated pool. Swallowing contaminated water can result in infection. ",
