"). The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three criteria: (1) acute-onset abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis (severe, persistent for hours to days, and epigastric in location, often radiating to the back), (2) serum lipase or amylase levels elevated at least three times the upper limit of normal, and (3) characteristic imaging findings. Because acute pancreatitis is most commonly caused by biliary disorders, patients with acute pancreatitis should undergo transabdominal ultrasonography. Transabdominal ultrasonography is preferred over CT for detection of gallstones because it has a higher sensitivity for detection of gallstones, avoids the risks associated with intravenous contrast, and is more cost-effective. Imaging during this patient's hospitalization revealed multiple small gallstones in the gallbladder. Her common bile duct is normal in size and without choledocholithiasis; therefore, it is likely that a stone has passed through the common bile duct. Gallstone-induced acute pancreatitis can be caused by obstruction of the pancreatic duct or the ampulla, causing bile to reflux back into the pancreatic duct."

") may be considered in the setting of ascending cholangitis with choledocholithiasis or if ongoing biliary obstruction is confirmed. The presence of cholangitis is manifested by fever, jaundice, and right-upper-quadrant abdominal pain and, in severely ill patients, hypotension and altered mental status. Cholangitis is potentially life-threatening, and antibiotic therapy targeting gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae should be administered. Identified common bile duct stones should be removed urgently with ERCP, after which elective cholecystectomy should be performed during the initial hospitalization or within 2 weeks to reduce the risk for complications. This patient does not have cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction."
