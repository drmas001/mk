Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, and these coexisting conditions may be exacerbated by the metabolic complications of antipsychotic therapy. Undertreatment of medical disease is also common in this population. Patients with pre-existing components of the metabolic syndrome are at highest risk. Routine periodic monitoring of metabolic parameters is recommended for patients taking any antipsychotic drug. Measurements of weight (and BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose level, and lipid levels are recommended at baseline when starting antipsychotic drugs. Weight should be measured at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and then quarterly. The other parameters should be measured at 12 weeks, and with the exception of lipids, should then be measured annually; lipid measurements are recommended at least every 5 years."
