"Funduscopic findings in glaucoma include vertical extension of the central cup, disc hemorrhages, and an increased optic cup-to-disc ratio (>0.5). All of these findings are nonspecific, however, and may be seen in patients without glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of permanent blindness in the world. It is typically characterized by increased intraocular pressure as a result of decreased outflow of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber. If central vision is not lost, patients can maintain normal visual acuity, potentially delaying diagnosis."
