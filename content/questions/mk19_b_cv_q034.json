In patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, the ascending aorta and aortic arch should be examined for aortopathy with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, echocardiography, or cardiac CT. In patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and aortic sinuses or an ascending aorta 4.0 cm or larger in diameter, lifelong serial evaluation of the size and morphology of the aortic sinuses and ascending aorta by echocardiography, CMR imaging, or CT angiography is reasonable. This otherwise healthy patient with mild aortic regurgitation and an ascending aortic root diameter below the threshold for repair should undergo repeat echocardiography for surveillance."
