" infection. It is usually caused by postnasal drip or airway hyperreactivity. If infectious causes of subacute cough are excluded, the evaluation shifts to consideration of the causes of chronic cough. In the absence of additional respiratory or constitutional symptoms, this patient's cough is probably a side effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Up to 20% of patients who take an ACE inhibitor develop a dry cough. Cough onset is usually within 2 weeks of ACE inhibitor initiation, but onset can occur later in some patients. Cessation of lisinopril should relieve this patient's cough within days, although the cough can continue for weeks after the medication is stopped in a small number of patients. For patients who should continue therapy with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), such as losartan, can be substituted. Even in patients who have previously developed cough due to ACE inhibitor therapy, the use of an ARB is not associated with an increased incidence of cough."

In patients with acute cough (<3 weeks' duration), accompanying symptoms that are mostly respiratory and constitutional suggest a lower respiratory tract infection, and chest radiography may be warranted. Pneumonia is an unlikely cause of subacute cough, and chest radiography is not indicated in the absence of abnormal vital signs or lung examination findings."
