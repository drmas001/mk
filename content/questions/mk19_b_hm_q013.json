His course of chemotherapy consisted of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine (day 1), and prednisone (days 1-5). He is treated appropriately with a broad-spectrum antibiotic and is discharged 5 days later feeling improved and with a recovering neutrophil count."

G-CSF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor can be given prophylactically to patients receiving chemotherapy that carries a high risk of neutropenia and as secondary prophylaxis in patients with a previous episode of febrile neutropenia. G-CSF administered on day 2 of the next chemotherapy cycle should reduce the risk of another neutropenic fever episode. G-CSF is not indicated for most patients with neutropenia who are afebrile, as a routine adjunct to empiric antibiotics for patients presenting with febrile neutropenia, or for patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia."
