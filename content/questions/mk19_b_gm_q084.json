") aims to improve health, avoid harms, and eliminate wasteful practices. This initiative addresses high value care broadly, offering learning resources for clinicians and medical educators, curricula, clinical guidelines, best practice advice, case studies, and patient resources on a wide variety of related topics. ACP believes that it is the responsibility of the medical profession to become cost-conscious and decrease unnecessary care that does not benefit patients. ACP has developed a five-step framework to assist physicians in delivering high value care: (1) understand the benefits, harms, and relative costs of the interventions that being considered; (2) decrease or eliminate the use of interventions that provide no benefits and/or may be harmful; (3) choose interventions and care settings that maximize benefits, minimize harms, and reduce costs (using comparative-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data); (4) customize a care plan with the patient that incorporates their values and addresses their concerns; and (5) identify system-level opportunities to improve outcomes, minimize harms, and reduce health care waste. Not performing unnecessary testing, as shown in this case, is an example of high value care."

The prevalence of defensive medicine is a challenge to the provision of high value care. Remedies that include emphasizing patient safety, promoting a culture of quality improvement and coordinated care, and training physicians in best practices to avoid errors and reduce risk will prevent harm and reduce the waste associated with defensive medicine."
