"). This patient presents with bilateral eye redness, pruritus, and watery discharge, which are characteristic of perennial allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is due to IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, with the resultant release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. In addition to basic eye care, including cold compresses, and avoiding eye rubbing and known allergens, topical pharmacotherapy is indicated for this patient given the degree of his symptoms. Topical agents in this category include olopatadine, alcaftadine, bepotastine, azelastine hydrochloride, cetirizine, epinastine, ketotifen fumarate, and emedastine. Generic ketotifen fumarate does not require a prescription. Although the full effect of these agents may take days, some effect is seen immediately. An advantage of this class of drugs is that it is administered only once or twice daily, depending on the specific formulation. The most common side effect is burning and stinging with application, which may be mitigated by using refrigerated agents."

"), such as trimethoprim-polymyxin B, have no role in the treatment of uncomplicated allergic conjunctivitis. This class of drug is effective for treating acute bacterial conjunctivitis in patients who do not wear contact lenses. Factors favoring bacterial conjunctivitis include glued eyes in the morning, redness completely obscuring the tarsal vessels, purulent discharge, and a red eye observed at 20 feet. Absence of a purulent discharge makes bacterial conjunctivitis very unlikely."

They would therefore be inappropriate to use in this patient."
