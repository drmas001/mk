"). This patient has signs and symptoms of acromegaly, including enlargement of her hands and feet, prognathism, and hypertension. Acromegaly is caused by excess growth hormone (GH) secretion from a pituitary tumor in 95% of patients. Fewer than 5% of patients with GH excess have a GH-releasing hormone-secreting tumor or neuroendocrine tumor. When GH-secreting pituitary tumors occur in children before puberty, the result is increased longitudinal growth, resulting in gigantism. Although gigantism is easily recognized in children, features of excess GH (acromegaly) are more subtle in adults and may not be recognized for years. Because IGF-1 is produced in the liver in response to GH stimulation, obtaining an IGF-1 level is the most appropriate method to evaluate for acromegaly and it is the best screening biomarker for acromegaly because it is more stable than GH level. IGF-1 levels are normalized for age and sex, and aging lowers the normal range of IGF-1."

") should not be obtained in this patient before measuring her IGF-1. Small incidentally noted pituitary lesions are common. In patients undergoing MRI for nonpituitary reasons, microadenomas are found in 10% to 38% of cases whereas incidental macroadenomas are seen in 0.2% of cases. Most pituitary incidentalomas (a pituitary lesion discovered incidentally on imaging) are benign nonfunctional adenomas. Because many patients may have a pituitary incidentaloma, obtaining imaging before a biochemical diagnosis of pituitary excess disorders may be misleading. When laboratory evaluation shows GH excess, a pituitary MRI should be obtained."
