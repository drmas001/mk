A decision is made to begin enteral feedings. His nutritional requirements are calculated to be 1460 calories daily."

"). Patients with critical illness should receive early oral feeding when possible and should be considered at risk for malnutrition when they have not received nutrition for more than 48 hours. If oral nutrition is not feasible, early enteral nutrition is indicated to minimize infectious complications associated with delayed enteral nutrition. New guidelines suggest that, in malnourished patients, caloric and protein needs should be increased gradually to their goal over the course of 3 to 7 days to avoid risks associated with early refeeding syndrome. When patients are chronically malnourished or endure prolonged starvation, the body shifts from metabolizing carbohydrates to metabolizing protein and fat as the main source of adenosine triphosphate production. In the process, intracellular depletion of key electrolytes such as potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium begins to occur. When carbohydrates or other simple sugars are reintroduced to the diet or given intravenously, production of insulin causes rapid intracellular uptake and a rapid drop in extracellular concentrations of electrolytes. These shifts have potentially life-threatening consequences, including diaphragmatic weakness and respiratory impairment, tissue hypoxia, fatal arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathies. Guidelines suggest that enteral intake should be increased slowly over a period of 3 to 7 days. Should electrolyte levels markedly decrease from their baseline, suggesting refeeding syndrome, these abnormalities should be corrected and the number of calories the patient is receiving should be either reduced or held steady."
