"). Surgery is the standard treatment for stage I and some stage II non–small cell lung cancers, and in patients treated with surgery, 5-year survival is about 60% to 70%. However, not all patients are surgical candidates. Before undergoing surgery, it is critical to perform a medical evaluation to ensure that surgery would not be associated with undue risk. That was done in this case, and it was determined that this patient was not a surgical candidate. Multiple studies have shown that stereotactic radiation therapy is an effective treatment for this patient population, with demonstrated excellent rates of local control, particularly in patients with stage I cancers. This patient, who is not fit for surgery, is a good candidate for such treatment."
