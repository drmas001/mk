"The most likely diagnosis is dengue fever. The appearance of a petechial rash following application of a blood pressure cuff, as seen in this patient, constitutes a positive “tourniquet test,” which supports the presence of microvascular fragility compatible with dengue fever. Dengue fever is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral infection in the world. Endemic areas include Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, South and Central America, and the Caribbean. The incubation period is 4 to 7 days. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with an acute febrile illness associated with frontal headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, and arthralgia, with or without minor spontaneous bleeding. Severe lumbosacral pain is characteristic. As the fever abates, a macular or scarlatiniform rash, which spares the palms and soles, may develop and evolve into areas of petechiae on extensor surfaces."
