"). In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer disease, factors that increase the risk for recurrent bleeding and death include tachycardia, hypotension, age older than 60 years, hemoglobin level less than 7 g/dL (70 g/L) (8 g/dL [80 g/L] in patients with cardiovascular disease), and comorbid illness. This young patient is otherwise healthy, has a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL (70 g/L), and is hemodynamically stable. Upper endoscopy for risk stratification revealed a clean-based ulcer, which is a predictor of low risk for recurrent hemorrhage. The other lesion at low risk for rebleeding includes an ulcer with a pigmented spot. These low-risk lesions do not require endoscopic therapy. Patients with peptic ulcer disease and low-risk stigmata can start oral feeding within 24 hours of endoscopy, receive once-daily oral PPI therapy, and be discharged from the hospital. NSAIDs should be discontinued in patients with NSAID-induced bleeding peptic ulcer disease. If there is no effective alternative to NSAIDs, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor plus a once-daily PPI should be used."

") would be appropriate for patients with high-risk lesions. Lesions at high risk for recurrent bleeding that require endoscopic treatment include actively bleeding peptic ulcers, ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels, and ulcers with adherent clots. An adherent clot should be irrigated with the intention of removing the clot; if clot removal is successful, the underlying stigmata is addressed. In this patient, intravenous PPI therapy plus hospital observation for 72 hours is not an appropriate management strategy given the low risk for rebleeding from a clean-based ulcer."
