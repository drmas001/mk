") is the most appropriate additional diagnostic test. The patient's sleeplessness and agitation suggest that he has developed a hyperactive delirium. His age and dementia diagnosis place him at increased risk for delirium; preexisting cognitive impairment is the major predisposing factor for delirium. The evaluation of delirium can be very difficult in patients who cannot provide a helpful history to focus the evaluation. A single cause of delirium is unusual, found in only about one-third of hospitalized patients; a mean of three causes of delirium is found in the balance of patients. The leading causes of delirium are fluid and electrolyte disturbances, infection (most commonly urinary tract and pneumonia), metabolic disturbances, sensory/environmental disturbances, and drug toxicity. The top three classes of drugs most commonly implicated in precipitating delirium are opioids, benzodiazepines, and drugs with anticholinergic properties. Intracerebral processes are uncommon causes of acute onset delirium and are usually clinically apparent. Based on these findings, a practical strategy can be developed for the evaluation of delirium in the absence of suggestive symptoms or findings. A careful review of medications should be the first step. Serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels may detect hyponatremia and suggest deficits in intravascular volume not detected on physical examination. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment in older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In this patient who cannot give a symptom history, a urinalysis seems a reasonable initial management step. If the cause remains obscure, it is reasonable to consider chest radiography."
