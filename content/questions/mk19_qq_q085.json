"). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with duplex ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and selective screening for men in this same age group who have never smoked but are otherwise at increased risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. AAA is a major and treatable cause of mortality, and risk factors (e.g., male sex, smoking history, advancing age) have been well established. In patients with AAA diameter smaller than 4.0 cm, surveillance with duplex ultrasonography every 2 to 3 years is warranted. In patients with AAA diameter of 4.0 to less than 5.5 cm, surveillance with CT angiography or duplex ultrasonography should be performed every 6 to 12 months. Once the aortic diameter meets the threshold for aortic repair (â‰¥5.5 cm), CT angiography or MR angiography is indicated to determine the exact location of the AAA (suprarenal, juxtarenal, or infrarenal) for planning repair. Statin therapy is the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia and the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Patients eligible for secondary prevention therapy include those with acute coronary syndrome, history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease including aortic aneurysm. High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are aged 75 years or younger to achieve a reduction in LDL cholesterol of 50% or greater."

") is driven by the location of the AAA and involvement of the renal and mesenteric arteries. Suprarenal and juxtarenal aneurysms most often necessitate open surgical repair. Patient age, comorbid conditions, and ability to tolerate open surgical repair determine which procedure is performed in patients with an infrarenal AAA. EVAR is associated with lower short-term (30-day) morbidity and mortality but no significant differences in long-term mortality. Additionally, EVAR is associated with greater need for repeat intervention and significantly higher rates of endoleak, device failure, and postimplantation syndrome (fever, leukocytosis, elevated serum C-reactive protein level). Before the choice between EVAR and open surgery is made, advanced imaging is necessary to determine the exact location of the AAA and potential involvement of other vessels."
