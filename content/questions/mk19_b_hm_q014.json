"). Survivors of pediatric leukemia (typically acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL) are at increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome as a result of exposure to cancer chemotherapy. The primary care physician should also request a treatment summary to fully ascertain the risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and secondary malignancies for this patient. Studies have shown that adult survivors of childhood ALL are more likely to have features of metabolic syndrome, including high BMI, truncal obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension compared with age-matched controls. Therefore, regular screening for dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension is recommended. Those in remission for 20 years or more are not at risk of ALL recurrence. High-dose glucocorticoids, typical of ALL regimens, pose a risk for osteopenia. A normal bone mineral density measurement at the time of entry into long-term care does not need to be repeated until age 65 years unless other risk factors for osteoporosis develop. Patients should be counseled about lifestyle risk factors, age-based screening, and early reporting of persistent symptoms."
