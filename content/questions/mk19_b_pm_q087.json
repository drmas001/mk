" and decrease mortality from COPD. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and approved pharmacotherapy to adult tobacco users. Combining behavioral counseling with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either modality alone. Effective counseling and behavioral resources include problem-solving guidance (e.g., developing a plan to quit and overcoming barriers), motivational interviewing, social support, and telephone quit lines. There is a dose-response relationship between the intensity and frequency of counseling and quit rates, which seems to plateau after 90 minutes of total counseling. All smokers without contraindications should additionally receive at least one of the FDA-approved treatments for smoking cessation, which include nicotine replacement medications, bupropion, and varenicline. Varenicline is superior to single forms of nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion. Moderate- and high-dose preparations of nicotine replacement therapy are more effective than lower-dose ones, and combining more than one type of nicotine replacement therapy (short-acting and long-acting) is more effective than monotherapy. Initiation of nicotine replacement therapy before smoking is stopped may also increase quitting success rates."
