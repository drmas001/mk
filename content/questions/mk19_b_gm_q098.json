"). Acute pharyngitis symptoms typically last less than 1 week. Most cases are viral in etiology, and only 5% to 15% of pharyngitis cases are caused by bacteria, most frequently GAS. The Centor criteria (fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough) can help guide the need for testing for bacterial pharyngitis. The Centor criteria have a low positive predictive value for determining the presence of GAS infection and are best used to exclude infection. Patients with two or fewer Centor criteria are very unlikely to have GAS pharyngitis and do not need to be tested or treated with antibiotics. Patients with three or more Centor criteria should be tested by using a RADT for GAS pharyngitis. This patient presents with four Centor criteria, placing him at risk for streptococcal pharyngitis, and a RADT is needed to guide therapy."

Even with multiple findings suggestive of a bacterial etiology, a viral cause is still reasonably likely, and RADT should be completed to confirm GAS pharyngitis before antibiotic treatment. No guideline recommends empiric treatment without testing."

In patients who are at high risk for complications (immunocompromised, high-risk contacts or environment), a negative RADT result should be confirmed by throat culture; otherwise, it is unnecessary. Results of throat culture generally take 24 to 48 hours. Empiric treatment with antibiotics while results are pending is not recommended because short delays in therapy have not been associated with higher complication rates."
