") for this patient with an ultrasound finding of diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, which is concerning for gallbladder cancer. Gallbladder cancer, the most common cancer of the biliary tree, is rare, with an observed frequency of less than 0.001%. Patients with early invasive gallbladder cancer may have no symptoms or may present with episodic right-upper-quadrant abdominal pain or biliary colic. Risk factors include gallstones, porcelain gallbladder (intramural calcification of the gallbladder wall), gallbladder polyps, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The potential resectability of this lesion should be evaluated with MRI and MRCP. The extent of local invasion can be evaluated, and the distinction between benign and malignant lesions potentially can be made. The initial treatment for gallbladder cancer is cholecystectomy. Tumors that extend beyond the lamina propria require extended cholecystectomy. If the tumor is found to be unresectable, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy or palliative care can be considered."
