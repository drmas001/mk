"). TLS is most likely to occur in patients who have larger tumor burdens and more chemotherapy-sensitive disease. It is usually seen in aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, as well as some leukemias and is rarely seen in solid tumors. TLS typically manifests in the first 24 to 48 hours after chemotherapy initiation but may even develop spontaneously before treatment. Patients develop hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia, which can be associated with arrhythmias, tetany, and seizures. Kidney failure may ensue from acute urate nephropathy, worsening the metabolic abnormalities. Prevention is with vigorous hydration and rasburicase."

Chronic progressive anthracycline toxicity usually presents as dilated cardiomyopathy, which is most closely linked with the use of doxorubicin. TLS is a much more likely immediate complication in patients with Burkitt lymphoma, with risk estimates generally greater than 5%."

The most common cause of SVC syndrome is lung cancer. Other malignancies less commonly associated with SVC syndrome include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. Mediastinal widening and pleural effusions are common radiographic findings. This patient with a normal chest radiograph and elevated serum creatinine and urate level is much more likely to develop spontaneous or treatment-related TLS."
