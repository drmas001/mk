She has secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with gait dysfunction, leg weakness, and poor vision. She uses a walker. She also has an overactive bladder with symptoms of urgency and frequency previously well controlled on solifenacin. Additional medications are fluoxetine and a vitamin D supplement."

She is unable to support her weight independently when she stands from a seated position. The remainder of the examination is normal."

"). This patient has secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) with worsening neurologic function, which suggests a potential MS relapse or disability progression. However, she also has urinary frequency and an elevated body temperature, which is suggestive of a urinary tract infection, possibly an upper tract infection. Many patients with multiple sclerosis experience Uhthoff phenomenon, in which chronic neurologic symptoms become more prominent in the setting of elevated body temperature (hot weather, physical exertion, or fever). Because this patient has pre-existing lower extremity weakness, she is likely experiencing Uhthoff phenomenon (or a “pseudorelapse”) caused by a urinary tract infection–associated fever and not a new inflammatory lesion in her brain or spinal cord."

Symptoms that persist despite treatment of the infection and fever may represent a relapse, and intravenous glucocorticoids would be a reasonable consideration."
