"). Large B-cell lymphoma represents approximately 30% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These patients often present with symptomatic enlarging lymphadenopathy in the neck or abdomen. Approximately 40% may have signs or symptoms of extranodal disease, and one third have systemic symptoms. Sixty percent of patients have advanced (stage III or IV) disease at diagnosis. The B-cell lymphoma 6 gene shows rearrangement or other mutations that lead to overexpression in most patients. Patients with higher LDH levels have a poorer prognosis, and the result is used in calculating the patient's International Prognostic Index score, which incorporates LDH along with age, stage, performance status, and the presence or absence of extranodal involvement. The International Prognostic Index score correlates with progression-free and overall survival after standard therapy. Patients with poor prognosis may be considered for more aggressive treatment."
