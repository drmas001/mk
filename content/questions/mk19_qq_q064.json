"). Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is typically characterized by narrowing of the aortic bifurcation and arteries of the lower extremities, including the iliac, femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause. The most commonly used diagnostic modality to identify lower extremity PAD is measurement of the resting ankle-brachial index, the ratio of lower extremity to upper extremity systolic blood pressures. In healthy persons, the ankle pressure should be the same as or slightly higher than the brachial pressure; therefore, a normal resting ABI is between 1.00 and 1.40. In the presence of atherosclerotic narrowing of the limb arteries, the downstream blood pressure and concomitant ABI value is lower. A resting ABI of 0.90 or less is diagnostic for PAD and correlates with abnormalities seen on imaging of the arterial tree. A resting ABI greater than 1.40 indicates the presence of noncompressible, calcified arteries in the lower extremities and is considered uninterpretable. This is most commonly found in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or advanced chronic kidney disease. In patients with an ABI greater than 1.40, a toe-brachial index is used for diagnosis. A toe-brachial index less than 0.70 is diagnostic for PAD."

A decrease in the ABI to less than 0.90 or a relative decrease of greater than 20% measured immediately after symptom-limited exercise is diagnostic of PAD. This patient has an abnormally elevated ABI, and the most appropriate test is measurement of the toe-brachial index."

The procedure involves pulse volume recordings (measurement of the magnitude and contour of blood pulse volume in the lower extremities) and blood pressure measurements at several locations in the lower extremities (high thigh, low thigh, calf, posterior tibial artery, and dorsalis pedis artery). Segmental pressure measurements can be a useful noninvasive method to localize vascular obstruction, but a toe-brachial index is the initial test of choice in this patient with high probability of disease but normal resting ABI measurements."
