", gram-negative bacilli, or β-hemolytic streptococci. This patient developed new symptoms in a prosthetic knee about 6 months after total joint arthroplasty. His history is typical of delayed prosthetic joint infection, with an insidious rather than abrupt onset of initially mild but then persistent symptoms. The physical examination findings are subtle: an absence of fever, local pain only, slight warmth, and mild effusion. The organism most commonly implicated in prosthetic joint infection in this setting with subacute onset, subtle findings 3 to 12 months after surgery is coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Because of the frequency of staphylococcal infections, it is always appropriate to initiate empiric treatment for infection while awaiting culture results; vancomycin is an appropriate first choice. When aspiration of a prosthetic joint is required, the procedure should be performed by an orthopedic surgeon."
