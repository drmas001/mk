") are the most effective therapy. Allergic rhinitis should be suspected if rhinitis symptoms (sneezing, congestion, rhinorrhea) are associated with a season, environment, or exposure. A thorough history focusing on symptom triggers is necessary for diagnosis. Allergic rhinitis is typically a clinical diagnosis, and additional testing for specific allergens (with blood or skin testing) is not necessary for making the presumptive diagnosis and initiating treatment. Studies have shown that intranasal glucocorticoids are superior to both intranasal and oral antihistamines (",

") for relief of sneezing and nasal obstruction. A clinical practice guideline issued by the 2017 Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, which consists of representatives of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, recommends intranasal glucocorticoid monotherapy as first-line treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis (strong recommendation) in preference to a leukotriene inhibitor (",

"type":"tag",

"). The Joint Task Force additionally makes a weak recommendation that patients with moderate to severe symptoms may be treated initially with combination therapy with an intranasal glucocorticoid and intranasal antihistamine."

"Some intranasal glucocorticoid preparations (e.g., fluticasone) may also relieve ocular symptoms, such as itching and tearing. Epistaxis is the most common adverse effect of intranasal glucocorticoids and occurs in approximately 10% of patients; however, it usually is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation of the drug. The rare side effect of nasal septal perforation can be avoided by using proper spray technique."
