" (MRSA) infections, particularly complicated bloodstream infections. Dosing is done in consultation with the pharmacy. When treating MRSA endocarditis, the AUC to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio (AUC/MIC) should be used for dosing vancomycin. The target AUC/MIC is 400 to 600 mg*hour/L to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity. For empiric therapy, the AUC/MIC calculation assumes the vancomycin MIC to be 1 µg/mL or less. The appropriate AUC/MIC ratio should be achieved early, preferably within the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment. AUC-guided dosing requires collecting several vancomycin concentrations, the timing of which should be determined by the pharmacy. Vancomycin is the preferred antimicrobial agent for this patient with MRSA tricuspid valve endocarditis. Blood cultures should be repeated until sustained clearance of bacteremia is demonstrated. Monitoring kidney function during treatment is also important."
