"). Vaginal trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Patients can be asymptomatic or present with pale yellow, green, or gray frothy vaginal discharge with itching and burning. Although trichomoniasis can be diagnosed with microscopy when motile trichomonads are noted on wet mount, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is recommended because it can be difficult to establish the diagnosis with a wet mount. Because trichomoniasis is sexually transmitted, patients should be screened for other STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and syphilis. It is also important to treat the patient's partner to help prevent reinfection and spread of infection to other sexual contacts. For women, the recommended regimen for trichomoniasis is metronidazole, 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. For men, the recommended treatment is metronidazole, 2 g orally in a single dose. Patients should also be retested for ",

"), 150 mg orally, is an appropriate treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis but is not appropriate for the treatment of trichomoniasis. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is typically characterized by vaginal itching, irritation, and discharge. Examination reveals vulvar edema and excoriation, with thick, white, curdy vaginal discharge. Diagnostic testing involves 10% potassium hydroxide wet mount of the discharge showing yeast, hyphae, or pseudohyphae or a positive NAAT. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is not an STI; there is no need to treat partners of women diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis."
