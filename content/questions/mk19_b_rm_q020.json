"). Osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis is based on history and physical examination; radiography is confirmatory but may not be necessary. In early OA, clinical findings may not be accompanied by radiographic changes; conversely, some patients with prominent radiographic changes may have minimal or no symptoms. Patients with OA are typically older than 50 years of age; diagnosis at an earlier age should prompt inquiry into a history of previous joint damage, endocrine or metabolic disorders, or a genetic proclivity for early disease. Joints most commonly affected are the hands (first carpometacarpal joints, distal and proximal interphalangeal joints), feet (first metatarsophalangeal joint and mid foot), knees, hips, and spine, but the distribution varies. Localized OA, in which a single joint is affected, is more often a consequence of injury or joint asymmetry and often occurs in weight-bearing joints (hip or knee). Furthermore, this patient has noninflammatory arthritis, as evidenced by minimal morning stiffness and no evidence of warmth, soft-tissue swelling, or effusion; these findings further support the diagnosis of OA. Additional tests would be helpful if other causes of arthritis were being considered or would aid in decisions about therapeutic options. No additional tests are needed in this patient."
