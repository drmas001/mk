") is the most appropriate management for this patient's asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy increases the risk for pyelonephritis and has been associated with preterm birth and low–birth-weight neonates. Therefore, pregnancy is one of the few indications for screening for bacteriuria in asymptomatic patients, and a urine culture is generally recommended at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is approximately 2% to 10%. In patients with untreated bacteriuria early in pregnancy, approximately 20% to 40% will develop acute symptomatic pyelonephritis later in pregnancy."
