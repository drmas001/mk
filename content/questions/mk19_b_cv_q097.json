"). Ibrutinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is an effective treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and various B-cell lymphomas. It has been reported to cause atrial fibrillation in up to 16% of patients, and this can be a therapy-limiting adverse effect. In one meta-analysis, the incidence of ibrutinib-associated atrial fibrillation was 5.77 per 100 person-years, much higher than in the general population. New-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with cancer is associated with increased risk for heart failure and thromboembolism. Î²-Blockers are usually used safely for rate control. Although diltiazem and verapamil are effective in blocking the atrioventricular node, they are moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, and they may significantly increase plasma levels of ibrutinib through this mechanism. Ibrutinib increases digoxin plasma levels, which may increase the potential for digoxin toxicity."
