"In pregnant patients with chronic hypertension, the 2019 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines recommend a systolic blood pressure during pregnancy of 120 to <160 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 80 to <110 mm Hg. In the setting of comorbidities or underlying impaired kidney function, treating at lower blood pressure thresholds may be appropriate. This patient's blood pressure is well within this range on treatment, and her blood pressure would be expected to decline during pregnancy. Therefore, monitoring her blood pressure after discontinuation of ramipril without the initiation of a replacement drug is a reasonable approach. If her blood pressure increases beyond the target range during pregnancy, initiation of a drug that is safe in pregnancy is recommended. In that event, first-line therapy includes methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine."
