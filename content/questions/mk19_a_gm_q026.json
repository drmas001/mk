"A 20-year-old woman is evaluated at a follow-up appointment for a 6-month history of disordered eating. She describes an intermittent uncontrollable urge to eat large amounts of food. When this occurs, she rapidly consumes substantially more food than most people would consume and eats until she is uncomfortably full, sometimes when she does not feel hungry. She reports feeling embarrassed and remorseful about these episodes. She does not vomit or self-induce vomiting. She has been treated with cognitive behavioral therapy and citalopram, which has reduced the frequency of binge eating, but the symptoms persist. She is concerned about her weight gain. She is otherwise healthy and takes no additional medications."

") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient with binge eating disorder, which is characterized by binge eating and feelings of loss of control around food that occur an average of at least once weekly for 3 months. Binging episodes include at least three of the following characteristics: abnormally rapid consumption, eating until uncomfortably full, consuming large amounts of food when not hungry, eating alone due to embarrassment, and feelings of guilt related to overconsumption. These characteristics distinguish binge eating disorder from overeating. The main treatment for binge eating disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Because this patient's symptoms have persisted while she is engaged in CBT, medical therapy can be considered. A systematic review found that CBT, lisdexamfetamine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and topiramate all reduced binge eating. Lisdexamfetamine and topiramate reduced weight in adults with binge eating disorder and should be considered for this patient, who has partial response to CBT and an SSRI. Side effects are common with lisdexamfetamine and include headache, gastrointestinal upset, and sleep disturbance. Lisdexamfetamine has been shown to reduce the frequency of binge eating days and is FDA approved to treat binge eating disorder. Topiramate is not FDA approved for this indication. In addition to initiating lisdexamfetamine, CBT should be continued in this patient."
