"). Evaluation of hip pain should be guided by location of the pain. GTPS is the most common cause of lateral hip pain. This syndrome comprises several soft tissue diagnoses, including trochanteric bursitis, hip abductor (gluteus minimus and/or maximus) tendinopathy, and external coxa saltans (snapping hip due to iliotibial tract or other tendons sliding over greater trochanter). Two or more of these diagnoses may coexist. Patients describe pain over the lateral aspect of the hip when lying on their side, bending to the side, and with prolonged sitting; pain may also radiate to the buttock or knee. The most common examination finding is tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter. Treatment is usually conservative, using heat, NSAIDs, stretching, physical therapy, and, if necessary, glucocorticoid injections."
