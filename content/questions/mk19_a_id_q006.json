"). Nonspecific constitutional symptoms that linger for months after Lyme disease treatment are common. Among patients with solitary or multiple erythema migrans (EM) skin lesions, posttreatment symptoms occur in up to 20% at 2 months, 16% at 6 months, and 6% at 12 months. PTLDS is defined as symptoms that are sufficiently severe as to limit the previous level of functioning persisting 6 months or more after antibiotic therapy. No evidence supports ongoing infection as a cause of these symptoms, and studies evaluating prolonged use of antibiotics in this population have not shown benefit. Recommendations for patients experiencing symptoms after being diagnosed with Lyme disease are to evaluate for alternative causes and provide therapy to lessen symptoms. Patients can be reassured that symptoms typically subside with time."
