"A 55-year-old man is evaluated for a 1-year history of worsening personality and behavioral changes, compulsive tendencies, a loss of empathy, and poor insight. Although he previously was neither a drinker nor a smoker, he now drinks heavily and smokes two packs of cigarettes daily. According to his son, the patient lost more than half of his retirement savings in the past month while gambling, and 2 weeks ago, he was arrested for breaking into a neighbor's house. Results of recent cognitive screening have been normal. He has no other medical problems and takes no medication."

"). The most prominent feature of behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia is an alteration in personality and behavior that typically develops years before the onset of cognitive impairment. Because these behaviors often manifest as obsessive-compulsive tendencies, impulsivity, apathy, and impaired judgment, patients with this disorder are often misdiagnosed as having bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression. Although there are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for frontotemporal dementia, SSRIs have shown effectiveness in treating some of its symptoms, especially by decreasing the frequency of compulsive behaviors. Consequently, SSRIs are considered first-line treatment of the behavioral disturbances of frontotemporal dementia and should be used before any agents with a sedative effect."

"), such as risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine, are not an FDA-approved treatment of dementia. Current evidence does not support the routine use of haloperidol or second-generation antipsychotic agents to treat delirium in adult inpatients.
