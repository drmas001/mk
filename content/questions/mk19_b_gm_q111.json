") that includes increased mobility, sputum clearance, deep breathing exercise, and inspiratory muscle training is consistently shown to reduce pulmonary complications after surgery. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated interventions to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications were defined as a composite of respiratory infection, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, atelectasis, or pneumothorax. Perioperative (either before or after surgery, or both) prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy showed an overall benefit (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93) in reducing the development of postoperative pulmonary complications. Other interventions associated with a reduced risk for postoperative pulmonary complications included lung-protective intraoperative ventilation, goal-directed hemodynamic therapies, epidural analgesia (replacing opioid analgesia), prophylactic mucolytics, and postoperative continuous positive pressure ventilation. All interventions showing benefit were associated with low-quality evidence."

Systematic reviews and meta-analysis have concluded that the routine use of a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach following abdominal surgery is associated with an increased risk for pulmonary complications, including pneumonia and atelectasis. Nasogastric tubes do have a role in patients with postoperative gastric distention or in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, but routine use following abdominal surgery is not recommended."
