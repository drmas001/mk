Relapsing-remitting MS can be further classified by activity status, and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis can be further classified by activity and progression status. Clinical relapses or MRI evidence of new or enlarging lesions define “activity,” whereas the gradual accumulation of neurologic deficits independent of relapses defines “progression.” Relapsing MS is typified by relapses or exacerbations, whereas progressive MS is typified by slow, progressive accumulation of disability. If relapses occur initially and are followed by progression, as seen in this patient, the status can be described as secondary progressive",

Current status of MS is evaluated by the presence or absence of current relapsing activity (such as new relapses or new lesions or contrast enhancement seen on T2-weighted MRI) and the presence or absence of progression (such as recent progressive disability accumulation). This patient presents with recent disability accumulation, and her MRI shows two contrast-enhancing lesions. Thus, her classification is secondary progressive MS with progression and activity."
