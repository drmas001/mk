"). Diverticulitis results from a diverticulum (herniation of the mucosa and submucosa through a weakness in the muscle wall) becoming blocked, trapping bacteria, and subsequently developing inflammation. This immunosuppressed patient has acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (no abscess, obstruction, or fistula). The medical management of diverticulitis is based on the degree of the patient's symptoms and severity of disease. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is treated with oral antibiotics and a liquid diet. Intravenous antibiotics with activities against gram-negative rods and anaerobic organisms are required in patients who cannot tolerate an oral diet; patients with severe comorbidities, advanced age, or immunosuppression; and patients for whom oral antibiotics have been ineffective. Typical regimens include cefepime plus metronidazole, single-agent therapy with a β-lactam or β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination, or meropenem. This patient, who is immunosuppressed because of her prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy, should be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotics."

Consideration of follow-up colonoscopy would be reasonable if more than 2 to 3 years have elapsed since the last examination."
