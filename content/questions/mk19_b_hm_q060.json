"). The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a safe, effective treatment for most patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The DOACs available for use in the United States are dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. In clinical trials of patients with VTE, patients were initially treated with a parenteral agent, usually heparin, and transitioned to dabigatran or edoxaban. Rivaroxaban and apixaban were studied without concomitant parenteral therapy and are approved as monotherapy for VTE. Dabigatran functions as a direct thrombin inhibitor, whereas the other agents are factor Xa inhibitors. Advantages of DOACs include no need for routine monitoring, rapid onset of action and short half-life, fixed dosing, and fewer drug-drug interactions. These drugs are as effective as warfarin in VTE prevention; although the overall bleeding risk was comparable, less central nervous system bleeding, fatal bleeding, and use of blood product support among patients taking DOACs was seen than with warfarin. Data from a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that DOACs may be preferred to vitamin K antagonists like warfarin in patients with early stage chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m",
{

},
") and atrial fibrillation. A key finding was that DOACS were associated with relative risk reductions of 21% for stroke or systemic embolism, 52% for hemorrhagic stroke, and 51% for intracranial hemorrhage. Apixaban has the lowest renal elimination of the direct oral anticoagulants (25%) and can be used by patients undergoing dialysis with close monitoring. Apixaban is the only DOAC approved for use in patients on dialysis. Warfarin is an acceptable anticoagulant in patients treated with hemodialysis. It has the advantages of long clinical experience and the ability to monitor the INR and adjust the dose to maintain safe and therapeutic anticoagulation levels."
