"In patients aged 20 to 75 years with an LDL cholesterol level of 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or greater, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommend high-intensity statin therapy regardless of 10-year ASCVD risk. Cholesterol levels should be remeasured in 4 to 12 weeks, with an LDL cholesterol goal of 100 mg/dL or less and/or a 50% reduction in LDL cholesterol level. All patients should be counseled on therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as exercise, weight reduction, and smoking cessation. If the LDL cholesterol level remains above goal with receipt of maximally tolerated statin therapy, initiation of ezetimibe is reasonable. The 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/U.S. Department of Defense cholesterol guideline does not specifically address the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia but would otherwise recommend moderate-intensity statin therapy for primary ASCVD prevention in patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or higher. Because statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, this patient's oral contraceptive should be continued."
