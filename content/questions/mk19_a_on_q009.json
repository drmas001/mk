The more common complications include dermatitis/mucositis, autoimmune endocrinopathies (thyroiditis, adrenalitis, and hypophysitis), pneumonitis, and hepatotoxicity. Colitis is a relatively frequent complication with immunotherapy and is most common with the combination of the CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab and a programmed death-1 antibody such as nivolumab. It can, however, occur with either drug alone. It presents with mild to severe diarrhea and can be life-threatening. Prompt recognition, discontinuation of immunotherapy, and initiation of glucocorticoid therapy are crucial for moderate or severe cases. Infections with enteric pathogens and ",
