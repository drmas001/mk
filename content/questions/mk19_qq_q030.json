") the appropriate choice to induce and maintain remission. Ulcerative colitis is an immune-mediated disease with a fluctuating course that is characterized by periods of remission and flare-ups of varying severity and extent of colonic involvement. Most patients have proctitis, but inflammatory changes often extend proximally in a continuous fashion and involve other segments of the colon. The presence of systemic symptoms, such as fever and tachycardia, as well as 6 to 10 daily bloody bowel movements, defines a severe flare. Because some of the symptoms of ",

" and infectious colitis may mimic ulcerative colitis flares, it is highly recommended that these conditions be ruled out. In addition to the clinical assessment, fecal calprotectin, a protein found in neutrophils, is useful in assessing disease activity and response to treatment. Glucocorticoids are appropriate for the treatment of severe flares of ulcerative colitis but should never be used for maintenance therapy. TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, golimumab, and infliximab) are effective for induction and maintenance in severe ulcerative colitis and may lead to a favorable response within days. Although well tolerated, TNF inhibitors increase the risk for infection."

Budesonide is a nonsystemic glucocorticoid that induces remission in flares of colitis, but only in mild to moderate cases. Oral mesalamine, an aminosalicylate, is commonly used for maintenance and may be used as a single agent to induce remission in mild to moderate, but not severe, colitis."
