"). This patient has advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon and a debilitated performance status; however, it is clear that the debilitation is due to tumor burden in an otherwise medically fit individual. The patient, previously well and active with no comorbid medical conditions, developed a rapid decline in health associated with the onset of tumor-related symptoms. This is the sort of situation in which aggressive management with combination chemotherapy (fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) is indicated. Only a major response to chemotherapy has the potential to reverse the debilitation, and if the tumor does respond to treatment, the patient's performance status is expected to improve toward her precancer, healthy state. This is a marked contrast to a patient who is severely debilitated by a combination of a cancer with heavy tumor burden associated with precancer comorbidities that reduced performance status before development of the cancer."
