"). Although the choice of initial therapy for established postmenopausal osteoporosis always has implications for the disease course, this consideration is especially true when anabolic agents (e.g., teriparatide, abaloparatide) are used. The bone formative effect of anabolic agents rapidly declines with discontinuation of therapy whereas the increased bone resorption caused by these agents persists. Rapid loss of the newly formed bone gained during therapy ensues with discontinuation unless antiresorptive therapy, typically a bisphosphonate or denosumab, is initiated within 1 month of completing the course of anabolic treatment. Based on these limitations, discontinuation of teriparatide (",

"Although the efficacy and safety of a 24-month course of teriparatide has been well established, the safety of longer duration of treatment is unknown. The most concerning adverse effect of teriparatide therapy is the theoretical increase in bone osteosarcoma. The risk may be minimal and a causal relationship may not exist, but data beyond 2 years of therapy are limited."

") is also not recommended. In addition to safety concerns, transitions of therapy may result in unfavorable changes in bone turnover distinct from the response of bone turnover for a treatment-naïve patient. For example, discontinuation of romosozumab is associated with transiently increased (“rebound”) bone resorption, a phenomenon that teriparatide exacerbates when initiated during romosozumab withdrawal."
