She is a young, otherwise healthy woman with no history of thrombosis and no known risk factors for thrombosis (injury, recent surgery, periods of immobility, airplane travel, smoking, history of cancer, contraceptive use). Without known provoking or reversible risk factors, anticoagulation should be prescribed for an extended period, with plans for yearly evaluation to discuss the risks and benefits of continued anticoagulation. Additionally, if the patient is being treated with a direct oral anticoagulant such as rivaroxaban or apixaban, the dose can potentially be reduced after 6 months of therapy."
