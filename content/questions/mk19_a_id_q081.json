"). Ramsay Hunt syndrome is characterized by peripheral facial nerve palsy (cranial nerve VII) accompanied by an erythematous vesicular rash on the ear (zoster oticus) or lesions in the mouth. In this patient, the oral findings include mucosal erosions confined to the right side of the tongue. Patients may have tinnitus, hearing loss, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus that can be explained by the involvement of the geniculate ganglion to the vestibulocochlear nerve within the bony facial canal. Differentiating between a peripheral and a central facial palsy is crucial because the latter is associated with an intracranial lesion. A peripheral facial palsy involves the whole side of the face, including the forehead, as in this patient.

However, Lyme disease would not present with vesicular lesions of the external ear and mucosal erosions confined to half of the tongue."
