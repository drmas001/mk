Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and screens for depression, other mood disorders, and additional substance use disorders are negative. He takes no medications at the present time."

It has been associated with a substantial decrease in 30-day readmission and emergency department visits when prescribed to patients with alcohol dependence at the time of hospital discharge. This patient would benefit from initiation of injectable naltrexone in addition to psychotherapeutic interventions, such as referral to cognitive behavioral therapy or a 12-step facilitation program. Patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder often require a multipronged approach with both psychotherapy and medication to ensure safety and minimize relapse. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guideline for the Pharmacological Treatment of Patients with Alcohol Use Disorder recommends acamprosate as another first-line therapy for alcohol use disorder and suggests offering disulfiram, topiramate, or gabapentin to patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder in specific clinical circumstances."

Although antidepressants may be useful in the management of coexisting mood disorders, they are not supported as standalone treatment for alcohol use disorder. The APA guideline recommends that antidepressants not be used for treatment of alcohol use disorder unless there is evidence of a concomitant disorder for which an antidepressant is an indicated treatment."
