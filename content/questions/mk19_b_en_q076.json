"). Common indications to initiate testing for pheochromocytoma include adrenergic-type spells (headache, sweating, tachycardia) with or without hypertension, resistant hypertension, onset of hypertension at a young age, and idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Other indications include familial syndromes that predispose to pheochromocytoma (e.g., multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2), or a family history of pheochromocytoma. Initial tests for pheochromocytoma include measurement of plasma free metanephrine collected with the patient in a supine position or 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrine and catecholamine levels. Elevation in catecholamines can occur in patients under psychological or physical stress. Certain medications can affect results and should be discontinued at least 2 weeks before testing. Mild elevations may require repeat testing. Levels more than four times the upper limit of normal, in absence of acute stress or illness, are consistent with a catecholamine-secreting tumor. The plasma free metanephrine test is highly sensitive (96%-100%). The specificity is 85% to 89%. Urine fractionated metanephrine and catecholamines have higher specificity (98%) and high sensitivity (up to 97%). Neither test is superior, so clinicians can use an estimate of pretest probability to select the initial test. In context of a high index of suspicion, plasma free metanephrine is chosen whereas urine fractionated metanephrine and catecholamines may be a better option for cases with low suspicion."
