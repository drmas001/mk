"). This patient has a hypomotility disorder. Esophageal hypomotility is associated with poor peristalsis, causing symptoms of dysphagia, and a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter, causing symptoms of reflux. Other symptoms can include regurgitation of undigested food, in particular when the patient is in a recumbent position. Esophageal manometry shows hypotonic, weak nonperistaltic contractions in the distal esophagus. In most cases, the cause of hypotonic esophageal disease is unknown. However, secondary causes include smooth-muscle relaxants, anticholinergic agents, estrogen, progesterone, connective tissue disorders (scleroderma), and pregnancy. This patient has systemic sclerosis. Both limited and diffuse systemic sclerosis are associated with hypotonic motility disorder. Treatment includes lifestyle changes, such as eating upright and consuming a liquid or semisolid diet rather than solid food. Medical therapy includes optimization of an antireflux regimen and low-dose antidepressants for chest pain if present. Esophageal chest pain symptoms may be alleviated by low doses of tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, or serotonin modulators, such as trazodone."
