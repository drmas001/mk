" yeasts that live on the skin. Men are more frequently affected than are women. The rash on the face is very common, especially in the elderly, in immunosuppressed patients (particularly in patients with HIV infection or organ transplantation), and in patients with neurologic disorders such as Parkinson disease. Patients may believe that their skin findings are due to dry skin on the face. However, the redness of the eyebrows and nasolabial folds, often extending onto the cheeks and chin with scaling, is typical of seborrhea and often does not respond to moisturization only. Seborrhea can be treated with over-the-counter selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione shampoos that are lathered into the skin and allowed to work for a few minutes and then washed out. Ketoconazole shampoo and topical ketoconazole cream are also very effective."
