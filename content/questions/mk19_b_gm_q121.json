"). According to the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), adults aged 65 years or older should receive either the PCV20 alone or the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at least 1 year later. Patients aged 19 to 64 years with underlying medical conditions or immunocompromise should also undergo vaccination. Eligible patients who previously received the PPSV23, such as this patient, should receive either of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. If PCV15 is used, follow-up vaccination with PPSV23 would not be necessary, as this patient has already received PPSV23. This patient meets the age criteria for vaccination and also has an underlying medical condition (cigarette smoking) that would prompt vaccination regardless of age. The ACIP does not recommend revaccination with PPSV23 (",
