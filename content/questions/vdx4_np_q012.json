"Ultrasonography is the most commonly used kidney imaging modality. It is easily available, safe, and relatively inexpensive. Ultrasonography can demonstrate hydronephrosis, kidney size and cortical thickness, echogenicity, and presence of cysts and tumors. Echogenicity is the ability of a tissue to “bounce back” or return the ultrasound signal and is recognized as brighter shades on the sonogram image. Echogenicity is nonspecific but implies acute or chronic parenchymal disease. Absence of hydronephrosis quickly rules out obstruction in most cases."
