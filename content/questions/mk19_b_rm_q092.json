"). This patient has a chronic inflammatory disease involving the cartilage (but not noncartilaginous structures) of the ears, nasal bridge (saddle nose deformity), joints, and trachea, as well as involvement of the connective tissue of the eye. Hearing loss is likely related to inflammation of the cartilage of the middle ear. Because relapsing polychondritis is a clinical diagnosis for which no specific tests exist (although certain autoantibodies, including those to type 2 collagen, may be supportive), other causes should be considered and ruled out as appropriate. Management depends on severity: NSAIDs and dapsone for mild symptoms and high-dose glucocorticoids for initial management of acute and/or severe involvement. Oral immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate) may be added. The tumor necrosis factor inhibitors infliximab and adalimumab and the antiâ€“interleukin-6 agent tocilizumab may also be effective."

However, cryoglobulinemic involvement of these tissues is typically ischemic/necrotic rather than inflammatory and usually affects the tip rather than the bridge of the nose. Cryoglobulinemia can affect the lungs but not the trachea. Moreover, most cryoglobulinemias (excepting type I cryoglobulinemia) are secondary to hepatitis C virus infection or primary autoimmune disease; testing for hepatitis C virus and autoimmune antibodies can be considered."
