This trial compared conservative with liberal fluid strategies based on central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (a surrogate for left atrial pressure) in patients with ARDS. Although mortality did not differ between groups, patients who were treated with conservative fluid management showed improved oxygenation and decreased time on the ventilator and in the ICU. In patients who are hemodynamically stable and do not have end-organ hypoperfusion, minimizing fluid administration is warranted.
