") will help predict this patient's responsiveness to inhaled glucocorticoids. Although FeNO should not be used as a diagnostic tool for asthma, it can be used to support this diagnosis in situations in which additional objective evidence is needed. FeNO may be useful if there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy. In adults with respiratory symptoms, FeNO levels above 50 ppb correlate with eosinophilic airway inflammation and predict response to inhaled glucocorticoids. FeNO levels below 25 ppb indicate that eosinophilic airway inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness are less likely; values between 25 and 50 ppb should be interpreted cautiously. In patients with asthma that is being treated with inhaled glucocorticoids, serial measurement of FeNO may help to monitor patient response to glucocorticoid therapy."
