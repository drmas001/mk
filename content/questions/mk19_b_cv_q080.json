"). This patient's echocardiogram demonstrates a large left atrial mass consistent with myxoma, with attachment by a stalk to the interatrial septum. Left atrial myxomas most commonly occur in middle-aged persons and are more frequent in women. They may present with valvular occlusive symptoms, such as dyspnea and syncope, or with embolic phenomena, including stroke or transient ischemic events. Atrial myxomas may produce cytokines that result in constitutional symptoms, such as fever, anorexia, and weight loss, which are present in up to one third of patients. Central nervous system embolic events should herald urgent cardiac surgical evaluation and excision in patients with acceptable surgical risk. Because of the possibility of recurrence, longitudinal screening with echocardiography is appropriate."
