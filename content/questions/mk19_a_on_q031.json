"). The second leading cause of death for survivors of HL are second cancers. Most second cancers are solid tumors, and among those, the most frequent are breast, lung, and colon cancers. The increased risk begins about 5 to 8 years posttreatment but continues to increase for at least 20 years. Secondary malignancies may develop in cancer survivors either from previous carcinogen exposure or late effects of previous cancer treatments. Women receiving chest irradiation for HL have a markedly increased risk of breast cancer, especially if they received treatment when younger than 35 years, with an increased risk beginning within 8 years of treatment. Annual breast cancer screening is recommended to begin 8 to 10 years post-therapy or at age 40 years, whichever comes first. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends breast MRI in addition to mammography for women who received irradiation to the chest between the ages of 10 and 30 years. The NCCN also recommends consideration of referral to a breast specialist."
