A comprehensive clinical history eliciting the temporal association of a specific exposure (avian antigen in this case) with symptom development suggests the diagnosis. The radiographic findings of micronodular opacities in the mid- and upper-lung zones are consistent with the diagnosis of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. High-resolution ",

Untreated, the disease can progress to a chronic form with the development of traction bronchiectasis and honeycomb changes. Removal of the offending antigen, if identified, is an essential and critical first step in the treatment of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Elimination of the offending antigen reduces the risk of exacerbation as well as disease progression."

Typical histopathologic findings in early stages of hypersensitivity pneumonitis include lymphocytic cellular infiltration with poorly formed granulomas.

In this patient, the temporal relationship between antigen exposure and development of symptoms plus supportive imaging findings strongly suggest the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis."
