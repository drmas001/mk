"). This patient with a history of celiac disease now presents with recurrent symptoms. The most common cause of recurrent celiac disease symptoms is gluten exposure. This exposure may be inadvertent. This patient's elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA level 10 years after diagnosis is suspicious for ongoing gluten exposure because serologic results typically normalize within 1 year of starting a gluten-free diet. Before nonresponsive celiac disease is diagnosed, a dietitian's evaluation of the patient's exposure to dietary gluten is important."

"In patients who truly have unresponsive celiac disease, other diagnoses should be considered. Some reports suggest that approximately 10% of patients with celiac disease and recurrent symptoms have a concurrent diagnosis. Conditions to consider include HIV infection, irritable bowel syndrome, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, microscopic colitis (",

"). This patient does not appear to have risk factors for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or chronic pancreatitis. Microscopic colitis deserves particular attention because approximately 4% of patients with celiac disease have this condition, but it is more typically found in middle-age and older women. Because inadvertent exposure to gluten is the most common cause of recurrent celiac disease symptoms, a referral to a dietitian and exploration of possible sources of gluten exposure is the best initial management option."
