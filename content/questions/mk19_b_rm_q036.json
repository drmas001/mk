He also has coronary artery disease, COPD, and a history of diverticulitis. Current medications are aspirin, lisinopril, metoprolol, a tiotropium inhaler, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine."

"). Rheumatoid arthritis treatment is aimed at controlling clinical disease and joint damage. Patients whose condition is unresponsive to initial treatment with methotrexate, with or without another nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, could receive triple therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) or a biologic agent. The choice of a drug regimen in such patients depends on many factors, including disease activity, comorbid conditions, patient preferences for route of administration and frequency of dosing, adverse prognostic features, and regulatory and cost barriers to drug access. This patient has active clinical disease and radiographic evidence of worsening joint damage despite combination treatment with sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Escalation to additional therapy with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, such as adalimumab, is an appropriate choice. Despite multiple comorbidities, this patient has no contraindications to treatment with a biologic (such as active infection or heart failure). All TNF inhibitors provide similar benefit and may be used in this patient based on the factors outlined above. These regimens may have a faster onset of action than triple therapy with nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs."

"). However, these agents are usually used after failure or intolerance of a TNF inhibitor. Furthermore, this patient has significant comorbidities that should prompt caution with consideration of these therapies. Abatacept has been associated with exacerbations of COPD in clinical trials but not in real-world practice. However, it must be given cautiously in patients with COPD. Tocilizumab increases the risk for bowel perforation in patients with a history of diverticulitis, and tofacitinib poses an increased risk for thrombotic events."
