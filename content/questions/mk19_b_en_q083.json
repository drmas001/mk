"). Although an adrenal mass was noted on imaging, adrenal vein sampling demonstrated that this lesion is not producing aldosterone. Primary aldosteronism caused by hyperplasia of both adrenal glands (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism) is the most likely diagnosis. Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism causes approximately 60% of cases of primary aldosteronism; a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) is found in approximately 35% of cases. Medical therapy with an aldosterone receptor blocker, spironolactone or eplerenone, is the treatment of choice for idiopathic aldosteronism, or when patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma are not candidates for or do not wish to undergo surgery. Spironolactone is often preferred over eplerenone because it is less expensive and has more potent aldosterone-blocking properties. However, patients on spironolactone are more likely to develop dose-dependent adverse effects, including gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction in men and menstrual irregularities in women."

") may lead to better control of the hypertension, but it would not block the other adverse effects of hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone has direct inflammatory and fibrotic effects that are independent of its blood pressure effects; higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have been noted in patients with primary aldosteronism compared with those with primary hypertension and similar blood pressure control. Therefore, treating the hypertension with lisinopril without addressing the underlying hyperaldosteronism with an aldosterone receptor blocker would subject this patient to the deleterious effects of excess stimulation of aldosterone receptors."
