"), as are other cephalosporin agents (cephalexin, cefdinir) and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Physiologic alterations in the urinary tract beginning early in pregnancy and increasing thereafter lead to ureteral dilatation and decreased peristalsis that allow bacteria in the bladder to more easily ascend to the kidney, resulting in a much greater incidence of pyelonephritis than that encountered in nonpregnant women. Cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy may also be associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery, so treatment is indicated. Pending culture and susceptibility results, initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy is indicated. The recommended treatment duration for cystitis in pregnancy is generally 3 to 7 days. A single dose of fosfomycin is a suitable but more costly alternative. Other than in pregnant women, test of cure is not indicated in those reporting symptom resolution. Follow-up urine cultures shortly after successful treatment completion are indicated in pregnant patients, with retreatment as needed. Controversy exists regarding the benefit of prophylactic antibiotic therapy throughout the remainder of pregnancy in women who have recurrent infections."
