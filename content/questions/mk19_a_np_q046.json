", the patient should be referred for RRT education. It is appropriate to begin the education process for the patient to learn about RRT options, including in-center and home hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation, and non-dialytic medical management, to make an informed decision in the future. An RRT education session empowers the patient to make decisions regarding venous access or preemptive kidney transplant to ensure a controlled initiation of RRT. It also helps prevents the risk for initiating dialysis emergently. Patients who receive preparatory RRT education before they are diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease are more likely to select a home modality for RRT, be listed for a kidney transplant, or receive a preemptive kidney transplant and may have a mortality benefit compared with patients who do not receive similar education."

Early referral is important because preemptive kidney transplants (transplants before needing dialysis) are associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with receiving a transplant after starting dialysis. Early referral also allows adequate time to identify suitable living donors; if no living donor is available, early listing is essential to begin the waiting process for a deceased-donor kidney. Referral for evaluation will be appropriate if this patient selects this mode of RRT following RRT education."
