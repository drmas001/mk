"), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). All patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) must have a thorough medication history performed to determine whether a medication is contributing to or causing the ED. SSRIs are commonly associated with decreased libido and ED, both of which this patient reports. For patients with depression, the American Psychiatric Association recommends continuation therapy (treatment after resolution of a major depressive episode) for 4 to 9 months in patients who responded to acute therapy for a first episode of depression. Antidepressant medications can then be gradually tapered. Because this patient reports no depressive symptoms and has been treated for 8 months, the most appropriate step is a trial taper of sertraline. If his mood worsens when the sertraline is tapered, initiation of the dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor bupropion could be considered. Bupropion is typically not associated with ED but can rarely (<1%) be associated with ejaculatory disorders. In addition to antidepressants, other medications commonly implicated in ED are antihypertensive medications, such as Î²-blockers, spironolactone, thiazide diuretics, and clonidine."
