Oral and topical NSAIDs do not help. She is otherwise well and takes no medications."

"). A bunion is a valgus malformation of the great toe that may result in pain and disability. The cause is unknown but has been attributed to wearing shoes with a narrow toe box; however, it can occur in patients who do not customarily wear such shoes. Bunion is diagnosed by inspection of the foot that demonstrates lateral deviation of the toe at the first metatarsal phalangeal (MTP) joint. In some cases, erythema of the joint is observed. A bunion deformity can be associated with several painful complications involving the first MTP joint. The most common cause of pain is bursitis medial to the MTP joint. Other sources of pain may include entrapment of the dorsal cutaneous nerve, synovitis, and generalized metatarsalgia as the patient shifts the distribution of pressure away from the great toe while walking. Radiography is not necessary for the diagnosis of bunion but may be needed to assess for underlying articular damage. Conservative treatment includes orthotic devices, wearing toe separators at night, and analgesics. The evidence supporting the efficacy of these measures is sparse. In some cases of severe pain and disability, surgery may be beneficial."
