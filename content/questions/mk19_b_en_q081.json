The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 years or older and considering screening in adults of any age with a BMI of 25 or greater (or ≥23 in Asian Americans) who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. These risk factors include a first-degree relative with diabetes, high-risk race or ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander), history of cardiovascular disease, physical inactivity, hypertension (≥140/90 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive therapy), HDL cholesterol level less than 35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L), triglyceride level greater than 250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L), polycystic ovary syndrome, or other conditions associated with insulin resistance."
