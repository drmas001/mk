Over the last 24 hours, the patient has been alternately agitated or drowsy, sometimes confused when awake, and tonight has experienced visual hallucinations. Her only other medical problem is long-standing depression treated with paroxetine, which has been discontinued. Medical records indicate she does not drink alcohol. Her current medications include oxycodone, scheduled every 6 hours, and piperacillin-tazobactam."

"). The patient shows signs of delirium, such as fluctuations in mentation, nighttime sleeplessness, and hallucinations. Treatment of delirium involves identifying and treating its underlying causes. In the elderly, medications are a common precipitating cause of delirium in hospitalized patients. Sedating medications, including opioids, can precipitate or worsen delirium, and holding or reducing the patient's overall dose of oxycodone is a reasonable first step in addressing her delirium. Withdrawal of alcohol and drugs such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and antidepressants can also precipitate delirium. Antidepressant medications should be gradually tapered to avoid discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation symptoms can occur with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor but is most commonly reported with paroxetine. The most common symptoms are dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Other commonly reported symptoms are agitation, anxiety, and insomnia. Symptoms may start from 1 to 7 days following abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant medications. Paroxetine should be reintroduced."

"Other classes of drugs that have been implicated in precipitating delirium in hospitalized patients include benzodiazepines and drugs with anticholinergic properties. Drugs with anticholinergic properties are associated with well-known adverse effects, particularly in the elderly, yet are commonly prescribed. Frequently reported central nervous system adverse effects include memory impairment, confusion, and hallucinations. First-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (",
