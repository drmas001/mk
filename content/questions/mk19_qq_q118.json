"). Arterial ulcers occur in the setting of significant peripheral vascular disease and result from inadequate perfusion of the lower extremities. Ulceration usually occurs at the distal aspects of the arterial supply (such as the distal toes) or in areas of trauma (such as overlying the metatarsal heads or shins and ankles). The ulcers are usually tender, have a well-demarcated border with a “punched-out” appearance, and are surrounded by erythematous, tight skin. Leg elevation often results in worsening pain, and examination may reveal diminished or absent peripheral pulses."

") is a rare disease that is most commonly seen in persons with chronic end-stage kidney disease, and those on dialysis with an elevated calcium-phosphorous product. The initial presentation may start as tender, dusky red macules or a livedo reticularis pattern. It quickly progresses to tender subcutaneous plaques with an overlying dusky red discoloration. Surrounding purpura is often found. The area of involvement quickly expands in an angulated arrangement. As the skin infarcts, a black eschar forms. This patient's findings are not compatible with calciphylaxis."
