"). Atraumatic spinal emergencies are most commonly seen first by emergency department clinicians or primary care specialists. The three most common atraumatic spinal emergencies are spinal epidural abscess, cauda equina syndrome, and spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma. Specific signs and symptoms can provide clues as to the cause of compression. The presence of fever and focal back pain and tenderness, especially in patients who have had recent back instrumentation or have a history of intravenous drug use, may indicate an epidural abscess. A history of cancer and focal back pain should raise concern for metastatic disease or pathologic vertebral fracture. Anticoagulant use raises the risk of compression from an epidural hematoma, particularly in the setting of recent back instrumentation or excessive anticoagulation. Spinal epidural abscess most commonly results from hematogenous dissemination, with ",

") are also implicated. Predisposing factors for bacteremia include endocarditis, injection drug use, long-term intravenous catheters (hemodialysis catheters, central lines), diabetes, and urinary tract infection. Spinal epidural abscess can also occur after neurosurgical procedures (spinal fusion, epidural catheter placement) or paraspinal injection. Patients usually develop localized pain at the site of infection that later radiates down the spine or into the legs. Blood cultures should be obtained before starting empiric antibiotics, but antibiotics should not be delayed by other diagnostic testing. MRI is the imaging modality of choice to identify location and extent of the abscess and is the preferred imaging modality for other causes of spine injury. The entire spine should be visualized because infection, bleeding, or metastatic cancer may be multifocal. Decompressive surgery followed by culture-directed long-term antibiotics is the treatment of choice for epidural abscess."
