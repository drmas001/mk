"), which is a recommended treatment for older adults with new-onset epilepsy. Incidence of new-onset epilepsy is highest in adults older than 60 years. Major risk factors for seizure recurrence include stroke and dementia, but about one-third to one-half of cases are of unknown cause. The diagnosis of seizures in older adults may be difficult because of atypical presentations that may mimic delirium, transient ischemic attack, or syncope. Possible seizures should always be included in the differential diagnosis of older patients with intermittent or fluctuating confusional states of unclear etiology. Antiepileptic drug therapy should be started in older adults following two clearly documented unprovoked seizures (e.g., seizures not related to alcohol metabolic derangements, medication, or medication withdrawal). The dosing strategy can be summarized as “start low and go slow” because older adults usually require lower antiepileptic drug doses and are at increased risk of interactions and decreased drug clearance. Multiple studies suggest lamotrigine, gabapentin, and levetiracetam are better-tolerated and equally effective seizure medications when compared with older antiepileptic drugs in treatment of older adults."
