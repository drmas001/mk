"A 38-year-old woman is evaluated for a 3-month history of depressed mood. She meets the diagnostic criteria for major depression. She reports no suicidal ideation or episodes of mania or hypomania. Her most troublesome symptoms at this time are difficulty concentrating at work and low self-esteem. She is in a new relationship, and there is the possibility of becoming sexually active at some point in the future. She has a copper intrauterine device for contraception. She has obesity and prediabetes and has experienced some success with weight reduction, but since the onset of depression, she has struggled with overeating. Medical history is also significant for hyperlipidemia and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Medications are atorvastatin and levetiracetam."

"), a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is often used as an alternative to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. It has not been associated with weight gain or sexual dysfunction and may help patients with impaired concentration. However, bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder or with certain conditions that increase seizure risk, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Because this patient has juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, she should not take bupropion."

However, among SSRIs, paroxetine has the highest rate of sexual dysfunction; a higher rate of weight gain; and the highest rate of discontinuation syndrome (dizziness, fatigue, headache, and nausea occurring after abruptly stopping or rapidly discontinuing antidepressants). The adverse effects of weight gain and sexual dysfunction make paroxetine a less attractive therapeutic option for this patient."
