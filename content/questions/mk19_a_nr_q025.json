"). With the growth of the aging population, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia is increasing. However, the incidence of dementia is declining with the control of vascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). Adjustments to diet will mitigate many of the risk factors for developing cognitive decline. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, fish and whole-grain cereal products are being studied and show some promise for increasing brain health. However, these benefits have not been confirmed. Exercise is the most important modifiable lifestyle factor to prevent the onset of cognitive impairment. Results from systematic reviews suggest that exercise training is associated with moderate positive effects for global cognition, logical memory, inhibitory control, and divided attention. Even exercise that is initiated in mid to late life can still provide benefits. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults perform at least 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. Other options include 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or equivalent combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise."
