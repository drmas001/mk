"A 67-year-old man is evaluated during a follow-up visit for resistant hypertension. He was recently evaluated for primary hyperaldosteronism, and the screening plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity ratio was >20. A dedicated adrenal CT scan showed diffuse bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. The patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and activity-limiting COPD. He does not want surgery under any circumstances. Medications are rosuvastatin, metformin, canagliflozin, amlodipine, enalapril, metoprolol, chlorthalidone, low-dose aspirin, albuterol, and tiotropium."

A plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity ratio >20 with a plasma aldosterone concentration of at least 15 ng/dL (414 pmol/L) is considered a positive result for primary aldosteronism and patients should be referred to an endocrinologist or nephrologist, who may perform additional testing to confirm inappropriate aldosterone secretion in a salt-replete state. Primary hyperaldosteronism is the most common cause of secondary hypertension in middle-aged adults and an important cause of resistant hypertension. In this patient, a dedicated adrenal CT scan shows diffuse bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, as seen in two thirds of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. Diffuse bilateral hyperplasia is managed by an aldosterone receptor antagonist such as eplerenone."

") for aldosterone is used to distinguish between unilateral adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia in patients who are surgical candidates and would like to pursue surgical management. Functioning adrenal adenomas can be very small and may not be detected with advanced imaging, but they can be implicated as a cause of primary hyperaldosteronism if aldosterone secretion lateralizes to one gland. This patient has multiple comorbid conditions and does not want to pursue any surgical procedures. Therefore, adrenal vein sampling is not indicated."
