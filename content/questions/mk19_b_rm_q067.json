"). The patient has postâ€“enteric infection reactive arthritis, with asymmetric pauci-arthritis involving the lower extremities, enthesitis involving the Achilles tendon, and dactylitis of the right fourth toe and left third and fourth toes. Reactive arthritis is the least common form of spondyloarthritis (2% of cases). Reactive arthritis typically entails arthritis/enthesitis in the lower extremities 2 to 3 weeks after an enteric infection or a bout of nongonococcal urethritis or cervicitis. Joint inflammation can be intense, with high leukocyte counts in the synovial fluid. The sacroiliac joints and spine may be involved. Enthesitis usually affects the heel (plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendinitis) or may present as dactylitis of the fingers or toes. Extra-articular features can include nonpainful oral ulcers; ocular inflammation (conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, or anterior uveitis); and a psoriasiform rash (keratoderma blennorrhagicum), typically on the hands and feet. Some patients also develop circinate balanitis on the glans penis or erythema nodosum on the lower extremities. Reactive arthritis is treated with NSAIDs at anti-inflammatory doses for at least 2 weeks. If relief is incomplete, intra-articular glucocorticoid injections and oral glucocorticoids can be used. If symptoms persist beyond 3 to 6 months, the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, may be necessary for symptom control and to prevent joint erosion. Therapy is discontinued 3 to 6 months following disease remission. Most cases of reactive arthritis last 6 weeks to 6 months; only 25% of patients have persistent disease. Long-term complications can include erosive arthritis, usually of the metatarsophalangeal joints; aortitis with aortic valve insufficiency; atrioventricular heart block; and uveitis."
