") is most likely to give this patient the greatest chance of success in quitting smoking. In addition to counseling and behavioral resources, all smokers without contraindications should receive at least one of seven FDA-approved treatments for smoking cessation. Long-acting preparations include varenicline, bupropion, and the nicotine patch. Four formulations of rapid-onset, short-acting nicotine replacement therapies (lozenge, gum, inhaler, spray) are also available. Varenicline is superior to single forms of nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion. Moderate- and high-dose preparations of nicotine replacement therapy are more effective than lower-dose ones, and combining more than one type of nicotine replacement therapy (rapid-onset and long-acting) is more effective than nicotine monotherapy. Initiation of therapy before smoking is stopped may also increase quitting success rates."
