"). The most commonly encountered causes of hemoptysis in ambulatory patients are infection (bronchitis or pneumonia) and malignancy. Chest radiography should be performed in all patients with hemoptysis. Patients at increased risk for lung malignancy who have hemoptysis should be referred for chest CT with contrast even if the chest radiograph is normal. Lung malignancy is found in approximately 10% of patients with hemoptysis and risk factors for lung cancer who have a normal chest radiograph. This patient is at high risk for lung malignancy based on her age and extensive smoking history; thus, chest CT with contrast should be performed despite the normal chest radiograph."

Bronchoscopy may follow if the CT scan is unrevealing or if the CT scan reveals an abnormality that requires visualization or endobronchial biopsy. Flexible bronchoscopy is particularly useful in high-risk patients who have negative imaging studies, often allowing localization of the site of hemoptysis and visualization of the endobronchial pathology causing the bleeding."
