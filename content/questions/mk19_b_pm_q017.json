"A 40-year-old man is evaluated 10 days after an emergency department visit for a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath. He was treated with nebulized albuterol and sent home with a 5-day course of prednisone and an albuterol metered-dose inhaler. Since completing the prednisone, he has felt well, with no further symptoms and no need to use the albuterol. He reports a similar episode requiring an emergency department visit 1 year ago."

"). Confirmation of reversible airflow obstruction is a cornerstone of asthma diagnosis, and spirometry should be performed on all patients with suspected asthma. For some patients, however, airflow obstruction is not present during the initial spirometry, and a bronchial challenge test is indicated to evaluate for bronchial hyperreactivity, which supports an asthma diagnosis. The test is usually performed with inhaled methacholine, although other stimuli (exercise, mannitol) also have been validated. Bronchial challenge tests measure spirometry following a controlled inhaled stimulus; a positive test is indicated by a drop in the measured ",

". If the result is negative, it is unlikely that the patient has asthma, but a positive result in isolation is not specific enough to diagnose asthma. Therefore, to confirm the diagnosis, patients with a positive methacholine challenge test and suggestive asthma symptoms must also respond clinically to treatment with asthma therapies. This patient's typical symptoms and improvement with standard asthma therapy would indicate asthma if the methacholine challenge test result were positive."

However, the role of FeNO in the diagnosis of asthma has not been established. Although an elevated FeNO is characteristic of type 2 airway inflammation, FeNO is also elevated in disorders such as eosinophilic bronchitis, atopy, and allergic rhinitis and is not elevated in some asthma phenotypes. Spirometry remains the first test of choice to diagnose asthma."
