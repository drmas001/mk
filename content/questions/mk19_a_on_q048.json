"). Bone loss occurs at an increased rate in cancer survivors who have taken long-term glucocorticoids and in women who have undergone surgical, irradiation, or chemotherapy-induced premature menopause or who are taking aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole for breast cancer. Adverse effects of aromatase inhibitors include arthralgia, vaginal dryness, sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular events, hyperlipidemia, and higher risks of osteoporosis and fractures. Compared with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors have a lower risk of venous thrombosis and endometrial cancer. Up to one third of women develop aromatase inhibitor–associated symmetric arthralgia, joint stiffness, and bone pain. Assessment of bone density and treatment or prophylaxis should be considered to reduce the risk of fracture. Management commonly includes routine supplements of vitamin D and calcium (while monitoring serum calcium levels), DEXA screening for osteoporosis, and for patients with confirmed osteoporosis, bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy. Vigilance is required to detect bisphosphonate complications such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical subtrochanteric spiral fractures of the femur."

"), a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand, could be considered if the patient is diagnosed with osteoporosis. In the absence of a bone density measurement, initiating treatment for osteoporosis is premature. Bone mineral density should be measured now, and in the absence of osteoporosis, repeated in 2 years. If the patient develops more severe osteopenia (T-score less than 2) or osteoporosis (T-score less than 2.5), then a bisphosphonate or denosumab would be appropriate."

") is in the same family as tamoxifen and works as a selective estrogen receptor modulator. It also has positive effects on bone density but is an inferior agent for breast cancer, so substituting raloxifene for anastrozole is not indicated. Raloxifene is approved for osteoporosis and for breast cancer chemoprevention in patients with high risk of breast cancer but not for adjuvant therapy of breast cancer, as is needed in this case."
