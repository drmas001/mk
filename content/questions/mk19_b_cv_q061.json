"). Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a syndrome characterized by transient regional systolic ventricular dysfunction mimicking myocardial infarction (reduced ejection fraction, elevated cardiac enzymes, and signs of ischemia on ECG) in the absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. In most cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the regional wall motion abnormality extends beyond the territory perfused by a single epicardial coronary artery. The syndrome is often precipitated by extreme emotional stress, such as death of a loved one. The pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unknown, but the condition is postulated to result from reversible myocardial toxicity induced by very high catecholamine levels. Women are affected more frequently than are men. Treatment is generally supportive and is similar to that for heart failure of other causes; most patients recover cardiac function over several months. Additional imaging studies may include cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to exclude myocarditis."

Other presenting features may include hypertension, syncope, a murmur of aortic regurgitation, and heart failure. Acute ascending aortic dissection may cause acute coronary occlusion; however, wall motion abnormalities would most likely involve a single coronary artery distribution, and obstruction would be detected by angiography. In addition, acute ascending aortic dissection can be visualized on echocardiogram."
