") occurs when fluid accumulation within the pericardial space compresses the heart and impedes diastolic filling. Clinical signs of tamponade include tachycardia, hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and elevation of the jugular venous pulse. Pulsus paradoxus represents exaggerated ventricular interdependence and is a key clinical feature of cardiac tamponade. The ECG may demonstrate electrical alternans (related to a swinging motion of the heart within the pericardial fluid) or low voltage. Some patients may also have ST elevations in many leads, including RV leads. The absence of a paradoxical pulse and ST changes in the inferior leads is not compatible with cardiac tamponade."

") can also present with chest pain, ECG changes, and hypotension. The chest pain of PE may be pleuritic. PE can also cause strain on the right ventricle with ST elevations in right-sided leads, and if the PE is sufficiently large, cardiac output may be impaired with resultant hypotension. However, PE is rarely associated with ST-segment elevations localized to the inferior leads. If the diagnosis remains in doubt, bedside echocardiography can often distinguish between RV infarction and PE; infarction will be associated with RV dysfunction, including hypokinesis or akinesis, and reduced RV ejection, among other findings."

It would be exceedingly uncommon for a patient to initially have a ventricular septal defect unless symptoms of chest pain were present for 1 to 3 days prior to presentation. In addition, the clear lungs on physical examination do not support the presence of pulmonary edema, which would likely be present with acute ventricular septal rupture."
