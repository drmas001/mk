"), which consists of symptoms of mood disturbance that develop the week before menstruation, remit within a week after menstruation, and occur with most menstrual cycles. Diagnosis requires the presence of at least one primary symptom: mood swings, irritability or anger, feelings of hopelessness or depressed mood, and anxiety. In addition, a patient must have a total of at least five symptoms, which may also include appetite changes, decreased interest in usual activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feelings of loss of control, sleep disturbance, and physical symptoms (breast tenderness, weight gain, bloating, myalgia). This patient has five PMDD symptoms that remit within a few days after onset of menstruation, and these symptoms cause clinical impairment."
