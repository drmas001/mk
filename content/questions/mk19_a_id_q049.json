Screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria before nonurologic surgical procedures, including prosthetic joint arthroplasty, has not proven beneficial in preventing postoperative surgical site infections. This applies to patients with diabetes, those with known immune disorders, and those receiving immunosuppressive medications. Antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (defined as the presence of at least 10",

},
" cfu/mL of one or more bacteria, without local or systemic signs or symptoms of active infection) has few recommended indications. Pyuria accompanying asymptomatic bacteriuria detected by a positive leukocyte esterase urine dipstick test or microscopic analysis is not an indication for antimicrobial treatment, and its presence often leads to unnecessary and potentially harmful antibiotic prescribing. Although women with asymptomatic bacteriuria are at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infections, antibiotic treatment offers no beneficial health outcome, and the risk of future symptomatic infections is not decreased. Additionally, this practice may be harmful, resulting in increased symptomatic infections with bacteria that have increased antibiotic resistance. Screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women is recommended, as is screening before a planned invasive urologic procedure that may lead to mucosal bleeding."
