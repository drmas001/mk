"), increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures in patients receiving glucocorticoids. Patients with age-related osteoporosis or osteoporosis caused by underlying disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) may benefit from bisphosphonate therapy regardless of glucocorticoid use. However, premenopausal women and younger men receiving glucocorticoids should not be treated with bisphosphonates in the absence of high fracture risk. This patient has been on glucocorticoids for a short interval; he will be undergoing a dose taper and is not at high risk."

Vitamin D supplementation may be appropriate in the context of osteoporosis care."

The American College of Rheumatology recommends BMD testing within 6 months of starting long-term glucocorticoid therapy in adults 40 years and older and in adults younger than 40 years with risk factors for osteoporosis or a history of fragility fractures. In addition, in men younger than 50 years taking glucocorticoids, osteoporosis pharmacotherapy would not be recommended on the basis of BMD T-score alone. This patient does not meet criteria for BMD testing."
