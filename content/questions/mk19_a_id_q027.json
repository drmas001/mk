Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed for CVID, but all require documentation of low IgG levels, with variable presence of decreased IgA and IgM antibody, and demonstration of impaired antibody production to antigenic stimulation. Antibody synthesis should be assessed by measuring antibody levels before and after pneumococcal polysaccharide and tetanus vaccinations.

Unlike many primary immunodeficiencies, CVID is often diagnosed in adults rather than during childhood. Diagnosing CVID is important because immunoglobulin replacement therapy decreases the risk of subsequent infections."
