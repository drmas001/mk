"). This patient has dementia with Lewy bodies, which is characterized by parkinsonian motor features (particularly gait problems and slowness of movements), visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and frequent fluctuations in attention. Because Parkinson disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, cognitive symptoms frequently develop at some point in the disease course. When dementia occurs well after the motor symptoms, it is considered Parkinson disease dementia. When dementia and motor symptoms develop within 1 to 2 years of each other, it is classified as dementia with Lewy bodies. The best diagnostic tools remain the clinical history and examination. Although not FDA approved for patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, both rivastigmine and donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) can improve cognition, global function, and activities of daily living. Evidence suggests that even if patients do not improve with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, they are less likely to deteriorate while taking them."

") is an antipsychotic drug, and patients with dementia with Lewy bodies are more likely to have severe sensitivity to antipsychotics. Haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic, is also more likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects. Diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies as early as possible is important because the behavioral problems associated with this condition frequently result in the use of antipsychotic agents. If an antipsychotic medication is required to maintain safety of the patient or people around them, one with a lower risk for extrapyramidal side effects (e.g., quetiapine) is preferred."
