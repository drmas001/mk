Current medications are losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, liraglutide, and rosuvastatin."

"). All patients with an incidental adrenal mass should be screened for mild autonomous cortisol excess (MACE) and pheochromocytoma. Patients with hypertension should also be screened for primary aldosteronism. A nonsuppressed cortisol level after dexamethasone administration indicates MACE as the most likely diagnosis. MACE is a condition characterized by ACTH-independent cortisol secretion that may result in metabolic (hyperglycemia and hypertension) and bone (osteoporosis) effects of hypercortisolism, but not the more specific features of Cushing syndrome (centripetal obesity, facial plethora, abnormal fat deposition, and wide violaceous striae). The preferred diagnostic test for MACE is a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test; a morning cortisol level greater than 5 μg/dL (138 nmol/L) is considered positive. After a positive test result, measurement of ACTH, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), urine free cortisol, and an 8-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test are often required to confirm autonomous cortisol secretion."

") would be a reasonable test if initial testing were consistent with primary aldosteronism. The most reliable case-detection test for primary aldosteronism is the plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity (PAC/PRA). A ratio greater than 20 with a plasma aldosterone concentration of at least 15 ng/dL (414 pmol/L) is considered a positive result and should prompt additional confirmatory testing. In this patient, testing is not indicative of primary aldosteronism and further testing with adrenal vein sampling is unnecessary."
