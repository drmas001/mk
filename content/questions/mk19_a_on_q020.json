"). IBC is diagnosed on the basis of the clinical examination and is usually characterized by erythematous and thickened skin, which is due to occlusion of dermal lymphatic vessels. Patients frequently present with breast enlargement or swelling that is often misdiagnosed as mastitis with subsequent delay in management. A palpable breast mass may be present. One-third of patients have distant metastases at diagnosis, and nearly all have lymph node involvement. For this reason, these patients should have routine staging with either CT and bone scan imaging or PET, even in the absence of symptoms of metastatic disease. IBC is associated with a high risk of both locoregional and distant recurrence and requires multimodality treatment. Patients with IBC should receive preoperative chemotherapy rather than mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and irradiation (",
{
"type":"tag",
"tagName":"b",
"attrs":{
},
"children":[

},
"). Preoperative chemotherapy aims to shrink the tumor to maximize the chance that mastectomy will be a complete resection with negative margins. Mastectomy is associated with decreased risk of locoregional recurrence and improved disease-free survival relative to breast-conserving surgery. Postmastectomy radiation therapy is recommended for cancers greater than 5 cm in size, inadequate or positive margins or skin involvement, IBCs, or four or more positive axillary nodes. Postmastectomy radiation therapy decreases both the risk of local recurrence and the risk of distant metastases and increases overall survival."
