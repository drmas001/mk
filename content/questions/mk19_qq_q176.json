"), caspofungin, or anidulafungin, is the most appropriate management for this patient. When candidemia is likely to be the result of an intravenous (IV) catheter, the catheter must be removed promptly because it serves as a nidus for ongoing candidemia. For candidemia related to IV catheters, the duration is shorter and mortality rate is lower when the catheter is removed than when it remains in place. In addition, catheter salvage is extremely difficult with fungal colonization, almost always requiring removal of the catheter. Although removal of long-term catheters may be a management challenge in patients being treated with a prolonged course of antibiotics, such as this patient, alternative short-term access is indicated to continue treatment and allow antifungal therapy to be given. Empiric antifungal therapy should be started because candidemia can be prolonged and may lead to metastatic complications (endophthalmitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis) if not already present at the time of diagnosis. An echinocandin is typically the preferred empiric agent for all patients with candidemia. Other considerations in choosing empiric therapy include a history of recent azole exposure, prevalence of different species and susceptibility data in a particular institution, the severity of illness, comorbid conditions (such as neutropenia), and evidence of disseminated involvement (such as the central nervous system or eyes). Blood cultures should always be repeated until candidemia clearance is documented. Treatment should be given for 2 weeks after symptoms resolve and blood cultures are negative for candidemia, or longer if metastatic complications are present."
