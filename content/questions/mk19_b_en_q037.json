"). Intravenous bisphosphonates (almost exclusively zoledronic acid) are useful for patients who cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates because of gastrointestinal adverse effects or contraindications. An acute-phase response reaction characterized by low-grade fever, myalgia, and arthralgia may occur within 1 to 3 days after first administration of zoledronic acid in 30% of patients. Antipyretic agents (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) minimize the severity of symptoms, especially when given on a schedule rather than in response to symptoms. Symptoms are relatively mild and of short duration for most, but younger women and those who have never received oral bisphosphonate therapy may have more pronounced symptoms. The likelihood and severity of symptoms decreases with subsequent infusions such that patients can be reassured regarding diminished symptoms during subsequent intravenous bisphosphonate treatment."
