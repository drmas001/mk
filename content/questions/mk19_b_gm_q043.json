"). Patients at highest risk for HCV include individuals who engage in high-risk sexual behavior (such as having multiple partners), practice unhealthy drug use, have been incarcerated, or are receiving hemodialysis. One-time screening for HCV should be completed in all patients aged 18 to 79 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not promote screening in patients older than 79 years, although the CDC does not specify an upper age limit. Patients with risk factors should also be retested regardless of age. Screening is accomplished by testing for HCV antibody, followed by HCV RNA quantification if results of antibody testing are positive. Conventional liver chemistry testing is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude chronic HCV infection."

There is no indication to screen this patient for sexually transmitted infections."

Men who have sex with men (MSM) and men and women living with HIV have the highest risk for syphilis; 61% of cases of primary and secondary syphilis occurred among MSM, and approximately one half of all MSM diagnosed with syphilis were also coinfected with HIV. Other factors associated with increased risk that clinicians should consider include history of incarceration, history of commercial sex work, and well-described regional variations."

Effective and safe treatment is available for patients with HCV infection, and screening for HCV should be performed and treatment provided to prevent complications of chronic liver disease and premature death."
