Two or more antihypertensive medications are recommended to achieve a BP target of <130/80 mm Hg in most adults with hypertension. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, four drug classes (thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs) lower BP and reduce cardiovascular or renal outcomes. Except for the combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, regimens containing a combination of these classes are reasonable to achieve the BP target."
