"). The characteristic finding of tinea infection is annular scaly patches with central clearing and varying degrees of inflammation. Patients can experience pruritus, burning, or no sensation at all. A definitive diagnosis is made with a potassium hydroxide scraping of the scale showing branching hyphae. Appropriate treatment is topical antifungal agents. This patient used an over-the-counter topical glucocorticoid and temporarily reduced the inflammation, which made his skin feel less irritated. Despite the impression of improvement, however, these agents do not treat the underlying condition and can delay diagnosis."

The decrease in inflammation in response to topical glucocorticoid and the presence of scale and central clearing are more suggestive of tinea corporis."
