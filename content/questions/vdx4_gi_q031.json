Numerous skin tags, which are commonly associated with the disease, are present. Patients with Crohn disease may present with fistulizing disease and have pneumaturia, fecaluria, and recurrent or polymicrobial urinary tract infections (caused by enterovesical fistulas); dyspareunia and vaginal drainage of feces (caused by enterovaginal fistulas); or seepage of bowel contents through the skin (caused by enterocutaneous fistulas). Crohn disease may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, is often discontinuous, and may cause transmural inflammation."
