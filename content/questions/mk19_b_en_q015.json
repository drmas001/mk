"). This sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor blocks renal glucose reabsorption and promotes the excretion of glucose and sodium via glycosuria, thus lowering blood glucose levels. The FDA approved empagliflozin for reduction of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Also, the American Diabetes Association suggests that in patients with type 2 diabetes and established heart failure, an SGLT2 inhibitor may be considered to reduce the risk for heart failure-related hospitalization. Because empagliflozin is renally cleared, considerations for renal dose adjustment are required. The marked benefit in cardiac and renal protection of this drug class must be balanced against the risks of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, increased urinary tract infections, genital fungal infections, and increased rate of lower limb infection, ulceration, and amputations."

") is a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that acts through several mechanisms, including increased insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia, reduction of gastric emptying, and reduction of glucagon secretion. Similar to SGLT2 inhibitors, this drug class has also demonstrated significant risk reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and diabetic kidney disease. However, based on postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in association with GLP-1 RAs, they are not recommended for patients with a history of pancreatitis. Liraglutide has not been shown to reduce the risk for heart failure-related hospitalization."

In addition, these agents are contraindicated in heart failure, making it a poor choice in this patient."
