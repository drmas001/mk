"). The risk of surgical site infection (SSI) associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy is lower than that with open cholecystectomy, but acute cholecystitis or common bile duct stones significantly increases the risk of SSI with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Most SSIs occur within 30 days following surgery (90 days for surgery involving placement of an implant). SSIs are categorized as superficial incisional, deep incisional, and deep/organ space infections. Deep incisional (involving fascia and/or muscle layers) SSIs and deep/organ space (tissue deep to the fascia) infections usually present with systemic signs of infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Differentiating between the two types of infection based on examination alone can be difficult, so imaging is necessary. CT is useful for identifying deep/organ space SSI abscesses and planning necessary drainage procedures, including obtaining material for culture to guide definitive antibiotic therapy. Bacteremia may occur with deep/organ space infections, so blood cultures should also be considered."

") is an acceptable antibiotic option for a superficial incisional infection, which commonly involves skin flora, but it is best to wait until culture results are available to initiate antibiotics. More importantly, this patient does not have a superficial incisional infection, but a deep incisional or deep/organ space infection, for which cephalexin would be inadequate."
