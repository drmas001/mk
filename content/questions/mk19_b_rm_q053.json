"). The patient has an acute onset of polyarticular arthralgia with minimal findings of inflammatory synovitis on physical examination. The history of a recent febrile illness with the subsequent appearance of a facial rash in the patient's child suggests parvovirus B19 infection (fifth disease). Up to 60% of adults with parvovirus B19 infection experience arthritis. It often presents acutely, is symmetric and polyarticular, and typically involves the proximal small joints of the hands. Parvovirus B19 arthritis should be suspected when appropriate clinical features are present in someone who has exposure to children. Acute parvovirus B19 infection is diagnosed by detecting anti–parvovirus IgM antibodies in the serum. The patient's symptoms could also suggest rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, but the brief duration of symptoms does not permit diagnosis of either of these entities at this time. It is appropriate to relieve symptoms with an NSAID but not to start immunosuppressive therapy now."

However, before initiation of an immunosuppressive therapy, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis must be confirmed. When symptoms are present for only a few days, causes of joint pain and swelling, such as viral infection and drug reactions, are in the differential diagnosis. When symptoms are present for at least 6 weeks, these diagnostic possibilities become less likely and higher suspicion for rheumatologic diseases will emerge. On the basis of the time frame over which this patient reports symptoms, initiation of methotrexate is not appropriate."
