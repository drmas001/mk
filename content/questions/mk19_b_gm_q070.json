"). HPV vaccination prevents persistent HPV infection, which can lead to cervical, anogenital, and nasopharyngeal cancers. The vaccine should be administered between age 11 and 12 years or between the ages of 13 and 26 years if not given previously. Individuals younger than 15 years can receive a two-dose series, whereas those aged 15 years or older, such as this patient, should receive a three-dose series. A history of HPV infection or an abnormal Pap smear does not change the recommendation for vaccination. The HPV vaccine is considered safe for individuals aged 27 to 45 years; unvaccinated individuals in this age group should participate in shared decision making with their physician about the benefits and risks of vaccination. Vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, although no harmful effects have been noted when inadvertently given to pregnant women and pregnancy testing is not necessary before vaccination."

Eight weeks should elapse between primary vaccination and booster. If the first dose was administered after age 16 years, such as in this patient, a booster is not required. College freshmen living in resident halls should receive the vaccine within 5 years of enrollment."
