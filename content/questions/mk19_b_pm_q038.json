"). This patient has severe, symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), for which PAP is preferred therapy. The response to treatment depends on adherence; a substantial proportion of patients, particularly early in the course of therapy, do not use PAP as intended (all night, every night). Symptom burden probably drives adherence, but for those who lack motivation, educational programs can help, as can direct-to-patient reports wirelessly transmitted from the device to smartphones or computers. Adherence might be improved by addressing common adverse effects. Side effects such as xerostomia and nasal dryness and congestion can be ameliorated by in-line humidification. Intranasal glucocorticoids or anticholinergics may be useful for recalcitrant nasal congestion or rhinitis. Modified pressure profiles that slightly reduce pressure on exhalation may enhance comfort. Proper mask fit enhances comfort and mitigates air leak. PAP interfaces, ranging from nasal pillows that sit at the nasal openings to nasal masks that cover the nose to oronasal (full face) masks that cover the nose and mouth, are frequently updated and improved and may improve adherence. Download of data from the PAP device yields important information about use that the physician can discuss with the patient to explore barriers and formulate a plan to promote adherence."
