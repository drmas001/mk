The patient, previously well and active with no comorbid medical conditions, developed a rapid decline in health associated with the onset of tumor-related symptoms. This is the sort of situation in which aggressive management with combination chemotherapy (fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) is indicated. Only a major response to chemotherapy has the potential to reverse the debilitation, and if the tumor does respond to treatment, the patient's performance status is expected to improve toward her precancer, healthy state.

Hematuria is defined as the presence of ≥3 erythrocytes/hpf in the urine sediment and may be microscopic (detectable only on urine testing) or macroscopic (grossly visible). A single incidental finding of hematuria is sufficient to warrant further investigation. Evaluation should be pursued even in patients with bleeding diatheses, or in those taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. If menstruation, viral illness, vigorous exercise, or some other benign cause is suspected, urinalysis should be repeated after the cause is resolved. If infection is confirmed, urinalysis should be repeated after treatment to document resolution of hematuria. Although CT urography (contrast CT with kidney-specific imaging) has the highest sensitivity and specificity for renal malignancy, noncontrast helical CT is more appropriate if a kidney stone is suspected. Ultrasonography is a reasonable first imaging step because of availability, lower cost, and no ionizing radiation. Cystoscopy is indicated when imaging results are negative."

Stage III colon cancer is potentially curable, although the risk of treatment failure increases with the number of positive nodes. Currently, all patients with stage III disease are recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy after definitive surgery, as large randomized trials have shown that this treatment modestly improves the likelihood of cure. The combination of oxaliplatin plus a fluoropyrimidine such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or its oral prodrug, capecitabine, has long been the accepted standard postoperative management for stage III colon cancer. The most commonly used regimen is the FOLFOX regimen of 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. 5-FU is given with the reduced folate leucovorin, which is inactive alone but causes 5-FU to bind more tightly to its target enzyme. Oxaliplatin with oral capecitabine is also an acceptable regimen for adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer."

"). This patient has advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma from a cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Diagnostic efforts should focus on identifying whether a patient is among the approximately 20% of patients with CUP who have a more favorable prognosis and who can benefit from a specific treatment strategy. A biopsy obtained from the site that can be sampled in the safest, least invasive manner is performed, and specimens are evaluated by immunohistochemical stains consistent with the tumor's pattern of presentation to attempt to establish a diagnosis of a more treatable subtype of CUP (for example, germ cell tumor or lymphoma). The clinical evaluation should not involve an exhaustive search for a primary site because detection of an asymptomatic and occult primary tumor does not improve outcome. Physicians should discuss with patients and their families that focusing on identification of the primary tumor can distract from the more important issue of managing the metastatic cancer. Efforts to identify primary tumors should focus only on tumors that are suggested by the clinical presentation or could be managed with a specific, effective therapy. In this case, metastatic disease located below the diaphragm is best managed as gastrointestinal cancer without additional testing for a primary cancer."

The 5-year relative survival for all stages of cervical cancer is 67.5%. The anatomic stage is the most important predictor of prognosis. Ninety percent of patients with localized disease survive 5 years.

Stage III cervical cancer extends to the pelvic sidewall and/or involves the lower third of the vagina and/or causes hydronephrosis or a nonfunctioning kidney.

Keeping this diagnosis in mind is important even in men who present with testicular pain without a clearly evident mass. Initial evaluation is typically made with scrotal ultrasound. Cancers are characteristically solid, so cystic masses are rarely indicative of cancer. Seminoma and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors have different ultrasound characteristics, but identification of any solid mass contained within the testicle should prompt further evaluation for cancer. Other studies commonly performed are serum tumor markers and other imaging studies, such as CT of the abdomen and pelvis and chest radiograph. In patients who have findings consistent with a possible diagnosis of testicular cancer, resection by radical inguinal orchiectomy is indicated.

Unfortunately for most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (>95%) whose tumors are mismatch repair–proficient, PD-1 inhibitors and other immune checkpoint inhibitors have thus far been essentially inactive."

"). The best available data regarding the safety of pregnancy after breast cancer come from matched cohort studies and have found that women with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive and ER-negative breast cancer who become pregnant after breast cancer treatment have outcomes no worse than women who do not become pregnant. These data suggest concerns that pregnancy, a high estrogen state, would increase the risk of recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer are unfounded. Consensus guidelines indicate that pregnancy after breast cancer should not be discouraged. Fertility is a very important survivorship issue and should be discussed with all patients of reproductive age before beginning cancer treatment. Fertility preservation options, including embryo and oocyte cryopreservation, should be discussed as options to preserve fertility before gonadotoxic treatment. Breast cancer survivors' fertility can be diminished as a direct result of chemotherapy, particularly alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide; however, other drugs including taxanes and platinum chemotherapy may also have an impact on fertility. Trastuzumab and endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen or ovarian suppression, are not believed to directly impair fertility, although the delay in pregnancy to complete endocrine therapy may be associated with reduced fertility due to an age-related decline in ovarian reserve. The standard for patients with ER-positive breast cancer is to complete the recommended full course of endocrine therapy before trying to conceive."

Immunotherapy can be used as single-agent therapy based on expression of the PD-L1 biomarker. However, in patients without a driver mutation (epidermal growth factor receptor",

"), the combination of pembrolizumab with carboplatin and pemetrexed has been shown to improve survival in those with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 level. This was shown in a randomized phase III trial that tested this combination in comparison to carboplatin/pemetrexed in the first-line treatment setting. This study found that the combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab improved survival regardless of PD-L1 status. Based on this result, the combination of pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is the preferred therapy for patients with good performance status who do not have a driver mutation. Contraindications to immunotherapy include connective tissue disease, rheumatologic diseases, or interstitial lung disease."

Depressive symptoms are frequently encountered in patients with chronic medical disease either as a result of the illness itself (such as hypothyroidism) or as a response to the disability caused by the illness. Depression commonly accompanies many medical conditions, including cancer, neurologic diseases (Parkinson disease), heart failure, and HIV infection. Medications, including tamoxifen, glucocorticoids, and interferon, may also trigger depressive symptoms. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, and other antidepressants such as bupropion, are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 and may interact with tamoxifen, reducing tamoxifen activation. The impact of this interaction on long-term breast cancer outcomes is unknown, but use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors is generally not recommended, and other SSRIs, such as sertraline or escitalopram, or venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, are felt to be safe and are preferred. Breast cancer survivors, particularly those diagnosed at young ages, are at increased risk of anxiety and depression, and evaluating and managing mood symptoms is an important aspect of survivorship care."

One-third of patients have distant metastases at diagnosis, and nearly all have lymph node involvement. For this reason, these patients should have routine staging with either CT and bone scan imaging or PET, even in the absence of symptoms of metastatic disease.

Blood vessels are buried as they course the disc. Multiple flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, resulting from nerve fiber infarction, are present. Glucocorticoids reduce tumor-related vasogenic edema in 75% of patients and often provide rapid symptom improvement.

Anal cancer is a squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the more common cancer of the rectum is an adenocarcinoma derived from the columnar epithelium of the rectum. Anal cancers are a human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated tumor and are of squamous cell histology. Rectal adenocarcinomas are not HPV-related. Risk of anal cancer is increased in men who have sex with men and in patients with HIV infection, history of condylomata, and kidney or liver transplantation. Presenting symptoms of anal cancer may include bleeding, pain, or pruritus; however, 25% of patients present without any anorectal symptoms. Although no formal recommendations address screening for anal dysplasia in at-risk populations, screening modalities to consider include digital rectal examination, anal Pap test, HPV testing, and high-resolution anoscopy. Mitomycin plus a fluoropyrimidine (now most commonly oral capecitabine, although some centers still use intravenous fluorouracil) is the standard chemotherapy regimen used concurrently with radiation therapy in patients with anal cancer."

He is incidentally found to have an asymptomatic, well-differentiated, low-grade, small bowel gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor (previously known as carcinoid) with multiple small metastases to the liver. Such tumors are often present for many years before diagnosis and are often very indolent. Nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors are often discovered incidentally. The liver is the most common site of metastases. Asymptomatic patients may have minimal growth and no symptoms for many months or years, even with metastatic disease. Therefore, there is no urgency to intervene, and all interventions carry the potential for risk and expense. A 3-month follow-up examination with repeat imaging is appropriate in asymptomatic patients with relatively low-volume, asymptomatic disease. Approximately one-third to half of metastatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors will produce serotonin, a hormone that causes diarrhea and/or facial flushing; however, most patients have a hormonally nonfunctional tumor and will not require treatment for these symptoms. In patients who have stable disease at the 3-month scan, further monitoring with serial imaging at 3- to 6-month intervals is appropriate."

Performance status is a means of quantifying how medically fit a patient is overall. A good performance status predicts favorable tolerance and response to treatment. Patients with a poor performance status are much more likely to experience serious or life-threatening toxicity and much less likely to benefit from treatment. In patients with poor performance status and metastatic non–small cell lung cancer, identifying a driver mutation has therapeutic implications.

") to prevent tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS occurs when tumor cells release their contents into the bloodstream, either spontaneously or as a result of treatment, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. These electrolyte abnormalities can lead to acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death. The risk of TLS can be categorized based on the volume of cancer mass present, the cell-lysis potential of the cancer, and patient characteristics of preexisting kidney failure, dehydration, acidosis, hypotension, or nephrotoxin exposure. TLS is seen most often in patients with highly proliferative hematologic malignancies, such as acute leukemia and high-grade lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, but can develop in other cancers. Patients at intermediate risk for TLS can be managed with monitoring of laboratory values, hydration, and allopurinol, and those at high risk, such as this patient, should receive vigorous intravenous hydration and rasburicase, a urate oxidase enzyme that metabolizes urate to allantoin, before receiving chemotherapy. Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and allopurinol should be used instead."

Metastasectomy can be the optimal therapy in appropriately selected patients with solitary or oligometastatic metastases in a variety of malignancies (mostly commonly melanoma, renal cell cancer, colorectal cancer, and sarcomas). Metastatic melanoma can be cured in some cases with metastasectomy. Melanoma may be more likely than some other more common cancers to manifest solitary or oligometastatic disease. The lung is the most common site of visceral metastasis for melanoma, although it has the potential to go anywhere and is more likely than other tumors to involve unusual sites such as the heart and small bowel. Although patients with fully resected metastatic melanoma are prone to develop other sites of disease, some do not. In some cases, repeated excisions of solitary metastases can lead to long-term remission. Solitary pulmonary metastases could also be addressed in some cases by radiosurgery or percutaneous radiofrequency. Positive prognostic factors for patients undergoing metastasectomy include longer disease-free intervals, fewer than three pulmonary nodules, the absence of extrathoracic and lymph node metastases, and a response to chemotherapy or immunotherapy."

"). Fertility is a key survivorship issue for young patients with cancer. Premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive chemotherapy are at risk of chemotherapy-induced menopause and infertility. Alkylating chemotherapy agents (including cyclophosphamide) are known to be gonadotoxic and are included in most adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer. The risk of gonadotoxicity depends on age with very young women (age <35 years) having a low risk of permanent menopause from chemotherapy. All premenopausal women receiving chemotherapy should be counseled on the risk of permanent menopause and infertility associated with chemotherapy and the availability of fertility preservation options. Fertility counseling in this situation is associated with improved psychosocial outcomes. Oocyte and embryo cryopreservation involves ovarian stimulation followed by collection of oocytes, which are then cryopreserved as oocytes or as embryos. Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation may be performed before starting chemotherapy and does not appear to be associated with worse breast cancer outcomes. Aromatase inhibitors are often used during ovarian stimulation in this setting to prevent an increase in estradiol levels. Cryopreservation of oocytes/embryos usually takes 2 to 3 weeks leading to minimal or short delays in care. This is the gold-standard approach for fertility preservation, although it does not guarantee the ability to conceive in the future."

Secondary malignancies may develop in cancer survivors either from previous carcinogen exposure or late effects of previous cancer treatments. Women receiving chest irradiation for HL have a markedly increased risk of breast cancer, especially if they received treatment when younger than 35 years, with an increased risk beginning within 8 years of treatment. Annual breast cancer screening is recommended to begin 8 to 10 years post-therapy or at age 40 years, whichever comes first.

Zoledronic acid and denosumab are generally administered every 3 months because of similar efficacy to monthly dosing. Zoledronic acid is cleared through the kidneys and is contraindicated among patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. Dose adjustment is not recommended for denosumab in patients with renal insufficiency. Both agents may cause symptomatic hypocalcemia. Additionally, both agents are associated with small risks of osteonecrosis of the jaw, and treatment should generally be held for patients who have active dental issues for which extractions or other dental work is needed.

Unfavorable prognostic factors for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma include the presence of a large mediastinal mass, an elevated sedimentation rate, involvement of multiple nodal sites, extranodal involvement, age 50 years and older, or massive splenic disease. The combination of chemotherapy and irradiation is associated with a high rate of cure in early-stage disease, even with adverse prognostic features. Using both modalities in combination has allowed for high cure rates while using shorter courses of chemotherapy (two to four cycles) and lower cumulative doses of radiation given to smaller fields, thus minimizing the potential for long-term toxicities. Chemotherapy alone could also be an appropriate option for this patient, avoiding irradiation entirely, if she has a complete metabolic response by interim PET/CT after two to three cycles of treatment (risk-adapted therapy).

Sustained rise in PSA or new abnormalities on digital rectal examination warrant an additional prostate biopsy, perhaps guided by MRI imaging. The goal of active surveillance is to more promptly identify men with evidence of cancer progression that requires treatment while also avoiding treatment in men who do not have progressive cancer. In men with low-risk prostate cancer, active surveillance is a reasonable strategy because some men will never require treatment, and outcomes are no worse if men with low-grade cancer are treated at the time of progression rather than when first diagnosed.

M0 castrate-resistant prostate cancer occurs when the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level rises without evidence of clinical metastatic disease in men being treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This condition does not always require treatment, as in men with a very slowly rising PSA level because it can take years before there is development of clinical metastatic disease. However, in a patient with a rapidly rising PSA level (e.g., doubling time ≤10 months), treatment is indicated, as development of clinical metastatic disease typically occurs much sooner. Treatment with androgen receptor blockers improves overall survival in this patient population. A large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial study concluded that apalutamide improved median metastasis-free survival from 16.2 months to 40.5 months. Apalutamide and enzalutamide are both standard treatments for this patient population."

Patients often present with breast enlargement or swelling developed during a few weeks or months, and younger, lactating women may have been treated for presumed mastitis with antibiotics. It is important to consider that IBC may be the underlying cause in lactating women who do not respond to antibiotics for an apparent mastitis. A palpable breast mass may be present. The skin changes are due to the obstruction of dermal lymphatic vessels by cancer cells. The initial diagnostic test is mammography followed by core biopsy of any suspicious lesion. The finding of dermal lymphatic invasion with a punch skin biopsy supports but is not necessary for the diagnosis of IBC. Patients with IBC have a higher risk of distant recurrence and also a higher risk of locoregional recurrence and should be treated with aggressive local and systemic therapy. All patients with IBC should receive preoperative chemotherapy to optimize the likelihood of obtaining negative surgical margins. Patients with IBC often have a greater extent of disease in the breast, and all should undergo mastectomy and postmastectomy irradiation to minimize the risk of locoregional recurrence."

A needle biopsy may be appropriate if the diagnosis is in doubt or if there is consideration for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

"). Hypercalcemia of malignancy occurs in 20% to 30% of patients with advanced cancer. It is most frequent in patients with myeloma and cancer of the lung, breast, kidney, head, and neck. Patients with severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia should receive isotonic saline volume expansion, which will increase renal perfusion and urine calcium excretion. The administration of isotonic saline at an initial rate of 200 to 300 mL/hour that is then adjusted to maintain the urine output at 100 to 150 mL/hour is a reasonable goal. Calcitonin increases kidney excretion of calcium and decreases bone resorption; it can decrease calcium within several hours in responsive patients. Tachyphylaxis to calcitonin may appear after 24 to 48 hours, so therapy is usually discontinued after this time period. This patient has an elevated serum creatinine level, which is a common complication of hypercalcemia, and intravenous isotonic saline may improve renal function as well."

"). Despite steady improvements in diagnostic and imaging techniques during the past decades, a reasonable evaluation will not identify the source of cancer in a small number (less than 5%) of all patients presenting with metastatic cancer. This heterogeneous group of patients is classified as having cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Standard evaluation of CUP includes a full medical history and physical examination and contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Histologic evaluation of the most accessible tumor mass should include a limited number of immunohistochemical stains to assess the nature of the tumor and to identify or exclude treatable histologies (such as lymphoma or germ cell tumor). Ultimately, CUP is a diagnosis of exclusion after evaluation has failed to identify the primary tumor, which may either be too small to be detected or may have been destroyed immunologically and is no longer present. The patient is a young male with a poorly differentiated CUP that is predominantly presenting in a midline distribution. In the absence of a clearly identified primary, these patients should be treated presumptively for metastatic testicular (germ cell) cancer with a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. The absence of serum α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin, normal testicular examination, or even normal ultrasonography does not exclude this treatment approach."

Bone loss occurs at an increased rate in cancer survivors who have taken long-term glucocorticoids and in women who have undergone surgical, irradiation, or chemotherapy-induced premature menopause or who are taking aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole for breast cancer. Adverse effects of aromatase inhibitors include arthralgia, vaginal dryness, sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular events, hyperlipidemia, and higher risks of osteoporosis and fractures. Compared with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors have a lower risk of venous thrombosis and endometrial cancer. Up to one third of women develop aromatase inhibitor–associated symmetric arthralgia, joint stiffness, and bone pain. Assessment of bone density and treatment or prophylaxis should be considered to reduce the risk of fracture. Management commonly includes routine supplements of vitamin D and calcium (while monitoring serum calcium levels), DEXA screening for osteoporosis, and for patients with confirmed osteoporosis, bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy. Vigilance is required to detect bisphosphonate complications such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical subtrochanteric spiral fractures of the femur."

") is the most accurate and useful imaging modality for staging of patients with a new diagnosis of colon cancer. Staging with the TNM cancer staging system is the first step in treatment planning. Preoperative clinical staging begins with a history to identify localizing symptoms that may represent metastatic disease and physical examination to detect ascites, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation includes serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in addition to routine chemical and metabolic studies. An elevated CEA level indicates a worse prognosis for patients at any stage of colon cancer compared to patients with normal levels. In addition, failure of an elevated CEA level to normalize after resection suggests the continued presence of metastatic disease and need for additional evaluation. A rising CEA level during the surveillance period after surgical resection indicates recurrent disease and the need for diagnostic imaging. Additional staging evaluation includes a full colonoscopy (if possible) and contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis. In addition to imaging the abdomen and pelvis, the chest should be imaged to rule out pulmonary metastases and to establish a baseline for surveillance. This staging approach is endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network."

If pathology following surgery confirms these preoperative findings, then no further therapy would be warranted. Therefore, for stage I rectal cancer, surgery alone is the preferred initial management. With the tumor located 10 cm from the anal verge, the surgical procedure of choice would be a low anterior resection, performed with the total mesorectal excision technique, with either a direct anastomosis, or, more likely, a temporary diverting ileostomy, which would be reversed after 2 to 3 months. Such a resection would be anticipated to be sphincter-sparing, and so the patient should not require a permanent colostomy. After therapy, patients with rectal cancer should be evaluated at approximately 6-month intervals for up to 5 years with a history, physical examination, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen level assessment. Contrast-enhanced CTs of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are typically obtained annually for 5 years."

Tamoxifen is associated with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and has a black box warning for use among patients with a previous history of VTE. Raloxifene, effective in breast cancer chemoprevention for postmenopausal women, also increases the risk of VTE, although not to as great an extent. Both drugs should be avoided in women with prior VTE if there are suitable alternatives. Exemestane is an option for chemoprevention of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with a previous history of VTE. Exemestane is not associated with an increased risk of VTE."

These tumors are often asymptomatic and indolent, and asymptomatic patients may do well with minimal growth and no symptoms for years without intervention. As such, there is no urgency to intervene, and it is beneficial to evaluate the pace of the disease before making a decision regarding whether to treat. Follow-up examination and imaging at approximately a 3-month interval is appropriate in asymptomatic patients with relatively modest-volume, asymptomatic disease. Approximately one third to one half of metastatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors will elaborate serotonin, a hormone that causes “carcinoid syndrome” with diarrhea and/or facial flushing; however, most patients have a hormonally nonfunctional tumor and so will not require treatment for these symptoms. In patients who have stable disease at the 3-month scan, further monitoring with serial imaging at 3- to 6-month intervals is appropriate."

This is a stage III rectal cancer, and optimal standard management would involve the use of all three modalities: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Clinical trials have shown that use of irradiation after surgery has greater toxicity and a higher risk of tumor recurrence in the irradiated field than when irradiation is given before surgery. Whereas a more traditional and still acceptable approach would be to use irradiation followed by surgery and then plan to give chemotherapy afterward, current practice is shifting toward the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy, in which both irradiation and chemotherapy are completed before surgery. Clinical trials have established that 5-fluorouracil given by protracted intravenous infusion or capecitabine is an equally acceptable chemotherapeutic option to be given concurrently with radiation therapy. Careful observation without surgery is becoming more widely accepted as a possible alternative strategy in patients who have a complete clinical response by examination and MRI after chemotherapy and irradiation."

Approximately 85% of epidural spinal cord compression cases are caused by epidural extension from vertebral body metastases. Lymphomas are more likely to involve a paraspinal mass that extends through the neural foramina to cause cord compression. Pain, often worse with recumbency, is present in more than 80% of patients and usually precedes neurologic symptoms by several weeks. The patient's neurologic status at diagnosis is the most important predictor of outcome. Of patients who are able to walk when starting treatment, 80% remain ambulatory; however, less than 20% of nonambulatory patients regain the ability to walk.

Secondary erythrocytosis may be due to a variety of conditions including systemic hypoxia, high altitude, chronic carbon monoxide exposure, and renal artery stenosis. It may also be caused by autonomous production of erythropoietin independent of hypoxemia, such as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Many different paraneoplastic syndromes can be seen in patients with renal cell carcinoma, including anemia, hepatic dysfunction in the absence of liver metastases (known as Stauffer syndrome), fever, hypercalcemia, AA amyloidosis, thrombocytosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and erythrocytosis. Many of these conditions can improve with resection of the primary tumor, metastatic sites, or both. An abdominal ultrasound will likely reveal a renal mass that may have sonographic features pathognomonic for renal cell carcinoma. If the ultrasound is equivocal, CT should be performed, typically revealing findings specific enough for renal cell cancer to avoid the need for a confirmatory biopsy."

It has a diagnostic accuracy of 88% to 89% and can be done rapidly in the office with limited or no morbidity. A more invasive form of biopsy would only be needed if FNA results were nondiagnostic. If found to be squamous cell carcinoma, this cancer should also be evaluated for human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, as this patient is in the appropriate age range for HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma, and a largely cystic mass on CT imaging is characteristic for this infection-related cancer. HPV-related cancers occur most commonly between ages 40 to 59 years. Although HPV status does not have an impact on treatment decisions, it is associated with an improved prognosis."

"). Men treated with radiation therapy rarely achieve an undetectable PSA, as is commonly seen after surgery. Rather, the PSA will fall with treatment and reach a nadir. PSA-only recurrence is defined as an increase in the PSA level by at least 2 ng/mL (2 µg/L) above the postradiation therapy nadir. This patient had a nadir PSA of approximately 1 ng/mL (1 µg/L) and now has a PSA of 3.2 ng/mL (3.2 µg/L) 9 years after treatment. Imaging studies did not reveal any evidence of metastatic disease. Therefore, he has a PSA-only recurrence. Treatment for patients with PSA-only recurrence is informed by the degree of PSA elevation and the rate of rise in the PSA level. For men with a rapid doubling time, defined as 10 months or less, treatment is generally recommended. Standard treatment in this setting is an androgen receptor blocker (such as enzalutamide). Men with a slow PSA doubling time (for example, more than 10 months) do not require immediate treatment, however, as it can take years for them to develop clinical metastatic disease. They can be monitored with serial PSA assessment, and treatment can be deferred."

"). Patients with small cell lung cancer have a high risk of developing brain metastases (prophylactic cranial irradiation [PCI]). Given that risk, initial staging should include brain MRI. Following completion of treatment for patients with either extensive or limited-stage small cell lung cancer, the risk of developing brain metastatic lesions remains significant, occurring in up to two thirds of patients following attainment of complete remission with initial treatment. Given this significant risk, PCI has been studied extensively as a means of reducing the risk of brain metastases. PCI refers to radiation treatment given to the whole brain in a patient without brain metastatic disease after the completion of planned cancer treatment. Many studies have addressed use of this treatment, and a meta-analysis of 12 different trials including more than 1500 patients showed that treatment with PCI resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of brain metastases as well as a significant reduction in mortality (this last benefit was only clearly shown for patients with limited-stage disease). Based on these benefits, this is considered a standard component of treatment for patients with either limited or extensive-stage disease who have responded to their initial therapy. Since this treatment was initially pioneered, safety concerns regarding cognitive impairment have been noted, although more modern studies have found that this risk can be mitigated with a lower total dose and a lower fraction dose."

"). Particular attention should be directed to the primary resection site for evidence of local recurrence (satellite lesions), in-transit metastases (looking for disease traveling along the course of draining lymphatics), and regional nodal involvement. Regional lymph node ultrasound can be performed to better assess for adenopathy in patients with an equivocal lymph node examination. The patient should also be carefully assessed for the development of second primary melanomas, as patients who have had one melanoma have a significantly higher risk of developing second primary melanomas. Furthermore, patients should be educated to perform routine skin self-examinations to screen for both recurrence and for new primary lesions."

"Breslow staging indicates the depth of invasion of the melanoma below the surface of the skin. The risk of recurrence increases as the depth of invasion increases. Ulceration at presentation and high mitotic rate are also associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Melanoma can be a very aggressive cancer and can metastasize widely, but if caught early, it has a very high cure rate. In patients such as this one (stage I, cT1aN0 indicating a depth of invasion less than 0.8 mm), the overall cure rate is approximately 95%."
