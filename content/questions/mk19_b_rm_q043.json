") is contraindicated in this patient. Patients with autoimmune rheumatologic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are at increased risk for infections because of multiple factors, and infection prevention and vaccination are crucial. Ideally, patients with autoimmune diseases should be updated with vaccinations 2 to 4 weeks before initiating immunomodulatory agents, but this is not easy to accomplish. Evidence suggests attenuation of response to vaccines in patients receiving biologic agents. Patients receiving traditional immunomodulatory agents (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) in doses that cause only low-grade immunosuppression can receive any immunizations, killed or live, without any problems. Low-grade immunosuppression is defined as short-term prednisone use of less than 20 mg/d, methotrexate dosage of less than 0.4 mg/kg/wk, and azathioprine dosage of less than 3.0 mg/kg/d. Patients who are receiving these immunosuppressive agents at higher dosages should not receive live vaccines. Similarly, patients receiving biologic or small-molecule therapies should not receive live vaccines, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, or live attenuated vaccines, such as influenza and herpes zoster, because of risk for infection by the vaccine agent. In this patient, methotrexate at a low dosage (0.2 mg/kg/wk) would not constitute a contraindication to administration of any vaccination. However, she is also is being treated with tofacitinib, and vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella is therefore contraindicated."
