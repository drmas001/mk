"). It is usually seen in adolescents who have been exposed to oral secretions. Mononucleosis typically presents with fever, nonexudative pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and occasionally a maculopapular rash (5%-15%) in the absence of antibiotic therapy. Atypical lymphocytosis and aminotransferase level elevations are clues to the diagnosis, which is established by the presence of heterophile antibodies (Monospot test) or IgM to the EBV viral capsid antigen. The Monospot test result may be negative in the first week of illness. Treatment is supportive; glucocorticoids may be given to patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, central nervous system involvement, or tonsillar enlargement with a compromised airway. Patients with splenomegaly should be warned not to participate in contact sports because of the risk of splenic rupture."

Because this patient may be reluctant to share accurate information about his sexual history, testing is still advisable."

This patient's presentation is not typical for respiratory diphtheria, and this infection would not be expected in a patient with a completed vaccination series."
