"). Smoldering multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a serum M protein level of 3 g/dL (30 g/L) or greater (or ≥500 mg/24 hr of urinary monoclonal free light chains) or bone marrow plasma clonal cells of 10% to 59% and no evidence of myeloma-related signs or symptoms. All patients with MM should be assessed for skeletal lesions at diagnosis, periodically thereafter, and when new symptoms occur. Skeletal survey following a negative low-dose CT scan would not provide any value. Low-dose CT and PET-CT scan are recommended as the initial imaging procedure because of increased sensitivity. CT is preferred because of its relatively high sensitivity, speed, and patient convenience. If initial imaging with whole-body low-dose CT is negative, whole-body MRI is recommended. MRI has been found to be more sensitive in identifying myeloma-related bone lesions and soft tissue lesions from plasmacytoma but is more inconvenient for the patient. If more than one lesion greater than 5 mm is discovered, the patient should be considered to have MM requiring therapy. In this patient with smoldering MM, negative findings on whole-body low-dose CT scan does not exclude skeletal lesions, and MRI is needed for further evaluation."

She has pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) characterized by normocytic anemia with decreased reticulocytes and absent or decreased erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and with giant proerythroblasts with intranuclear viral inclusions characteristic of parvovirus B19 infection. Several conditions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PRCA, and chief among them are parvovirus B19 infection, thymoma, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus), and lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas. Because of her recent chemotherapy, she is immunocompromised and vulnerable to viral infections such as parvovirus B19, which she may have been exposed to as a kindergarten teacher. Parvovirus infection in adults may be asymptomatic or associated with fever, coryza, headache, nausea, and diarrhea, followed by a rash. In adults, the classic “slapped cheek” rash may not be apparent but other cutaneous manifestations may occur. Parvovirus infection is usually transient and rarely causes clinically significant anemia in healthy patients. However, parvovirus is cytotoxic to erythrocyte precursors, and significant anemia can develop in patients with chronic hemolysis (such as sickle cell anemia) who depend on increased erythrocyte production to maintain hemoglobin levels. Immunocompromised patients can have sustained viremia leading to prolonged anemia requiring IVIG treatment to hasten viral clearance."

She has an elevated D-dimer measurement, but D-dimer levels progressively increase during the course of pregnancy, making interpretation difficult. To assist in the diagnosis of PE in pregnant women, diagnostic algorithms have been developed. The YEARS criteria have been shown to reduce the risk of unnecessary CT angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having a PE. The YEARS algorithm assigns 1 point each for the presence of three cardinal criteria: clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis, hemoptysis, and PE as the most likely diagnosis (point range 0-3). The score is used in conjunction with four potential D-dimer results (<0.5 μg/mL [0.5 mg/L], ≥0.5 μg/mL [0.5 mg/L], <1 μg/mL [1 mg/L], and ≥1 μg/mL [1 mg/L]). This patient met no YEARS clinical criteria and had a D-dimer measurement less than 1 μg/mL (1 mg/L). This corresponds to very low risk for PE, so she should not undergo additional testing or anticoagulation."

"). This patient has acute chest syndrome (ACS), which develops as a result of vaso-occlusion in the pulmonary microvasculature. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), ACS should be considered and treatment begun in those presenting with fever, hypoxia, chest pain, and new consolidation on radiographic imaging because patients can rapidly deteriorate and develop multiorgan failure. ACS is the leading cause of death in patients with sickle cell anemia; although patients with all types of SCD can develop ACS, rates are highest in those with hemoglobin SS disease. Treatment consists of supportive measures, including analgesia and supplemental oxygen, with many patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Because ACS shares many clinical features with pneumonia and can be triggered by infection, empiric antibiotic therapy for pneumonia is considered accepted care. However, erythrocyte transfusion is the main treatment intervention. Simple transfusion can be used for milder presentations, but exchange transfusion is recommended for more severe forms. The posttransfusion target hemoglobin S is less than 30% and target hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (100 g/L)."

In WAIHA, a polyclonal autoantibody interacts with multiple erythrocyte antigens, causing extravascular hemolysis. The autoantibody is typically IgG, although it can rarely be IgM or IgA. Splenic macrophages phagocytize the IgG on the erythrocyte, as well as a portion of the membrane, resulting in spherocyte formation. Patients have evidence of hemolysis, including anemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase level, low haptoglobin level, and an indirect bilirubinemia. Reticulocytosis is also seen if no concomitant processes are present that could blunt the compensatory bone marrow response (e.g., iron deficiency). Approximately half of patients with WAIHA will have another underlying disease process, including viral infections, lymphoproliferative diseases, and other autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The DAT evaluates for the presence of IgG and complement (C3) on the patient's erythrocytes and is positive in 95% of patients with WAIHA."

The primary care physician should also request a treatment summary to fully ascertain the risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and secondary malignancies for this patient. Studies have shown that adult survivors of childhood ALL are more likely to have features of metabolic syndrome, including high BMI, truncal obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension compared with age-matched controls. Therefore, regular screening for dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension is recommended. Those in remission for 20 years or more are not at risk of ALL recurrence. High-dose glucocorticoids, typical of ALL regimens, pose a risk for osteopenia. A normal bone mineral density measurement at the time of entry into long-term care does not need to be repeated until age 65 years unless other risk factors for osteoporosis develop. Patients should be counseled about lifestyle risk factors, age-based screening, and early reporting of persistent symptoms."

"). The most likely cause of this patient's posttonsillectomy bleeding and history of menorrhagia is factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C), which is rare overall but more common among persons of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Factor XI is part of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, and patients with factor XI deficiency can have isolated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolongation. Although patients with severe factor XI deficiency (<20%) are more likely to have a history of bleeding, this can vary and does not tightly correlate with the measured factor XI activity. Patients typically do not experience spontaneous bruising, muscle hematomas, or hemarthroses but tend to have postsurgical bleeding, particularly from sites with high endogenous fibrinolytic activity (dental, nasal, oropharyngeal, genitourinary), or menorrhagia and postpartum hemorrhage. Therefore, even patients with severe factor XI deficiency do not typically require treatment; they may require hemostatic prophylaxis or treatment to control bleeding from surgery. Deficiencies in factors VIII, IX, and XII may also result in isolated aPTT prolongation. However, factor XII deficiency is not associated with a bleeding tendency, and congenital deficiencies in factors VIII and IX are X-linked disorders primarily affecting men, whereas women are asymptomatic carriers. Thus, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is a factor XI deficiency. The mixing study confirms the presence of a factor deficiency by demonstrating complete correction of the aPTT following a one-to-one mix with normal plasma; evaluating factor XI activity would confirm the presence of factor XI deficiency."

Membrane loss causes a decreased surface-to-volume ratio and loss of the biconcave shape, resulting in a more spherical erythrocyte shape (spherocytes). The structural erythrocyte changes lead to less deformability in the microcirculation and increase phagocytosis by macrophages, mainly in the spleen, resulting in hemolysis. Splenomegaly is common. Laboratory findings include anemia, reticulocytosis, signs of hemolysis, and an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The clinical severity of HS varies considerably. Mild forms are common, with normal or near-normal hemoglobin levels, and patients can compensate for the hemolysis. Those with severe forms have more brisk hemolysis and a greater degree of anemia, which often worsens at times of oxidative stress, such as viral infections; pigmented gallstones and aplastic crises from parvovirus infections can also be seen. Treatment depends on disease severity. Mild forms can be monitored. Patients with HS, as with other hemolytic states, have increased folate requirements and should receive supplemental folate. A typical dose for moderate to severe hemolysis is 1 to 2 mg/day."

The pink color of the urine suggests the release of free hemoglobin resulting from intravascular hemolysis. An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is most often caused by an ABO incompatibility, either because the pilot tube used to type and crossmatch the patient was mislabeled or because the unit of blood was administered to the wrong patient. Hemolysis may also be caused by an alloantibody that was too low to be detected in his pretransfusion evaluation, but this is more likely to cause a more gradual delayed hemolytic reaction rather than an acute and life-threatening event. The transfusion must be stopped because the degree of hemolysis and prognosis is proportional to the volume transfused. Volume expansion and supportive care for associated complications are also necessary. An investigation into the cause of the reaction is initiated in each case, including a repeat type and screen and a direct antiglobulin test. Additional laboratory evaluation will support the diagnosis of hemolysis and assess for the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation."

Patients undergo HLA typing, and siblings are considered for stem cell donation; HLA-matched unrelated donors may also be a reasonable option.

As a rule of thumb, approximately seven platelets are normally seen per 100-power field.

"). DIC results from the simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. It is associated with severe sepsis, usually with septic shock; with disseminated malignancy, most classically with mucin-secreting pancreatic adenocarcinoma; and in pregnancy, with complications of placental abruption and eclampsia. The initial pathogenesis involves widespread endothelial injury and circulating procoagulants that lead to disseminated microvascular thrombi, with consumption of platelets and clotting factors, and erythrocyte shearing injury leading to hemolysis. Fibrinolysis is accelerated, resulting in dissolution of the microvascular thrombus, usually before thrombotic complications are noted. Classic laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times (aPTT, PT), elevated INR, hypofibrinogenemia, and elevated D-dimer level. Management is directed primarily at the inciting cause of DIC and supported with platelet transfusions, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma as needed. In this previously well, young patient with DIC associated with pancytopenia, an underlying leukemia should be suspected. A characteristic feature of acute promyelocytic leukemia is presentation with DIC at the time of diagnosis."

The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and simplified PESI have been most widely validated. This recommendation does not apply to patients who have other conditions that would require hospitalization, have limited or no support at home, and cannot afford medications or have a history of poor adherence. The simplified PESI assigns 1 point for each of the following: age older than 80 years, history of cardiopulmonary disease, history of cancer, pulse rate 110/min or greater, systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation less than 90%. If none of these criteria are met, the patient is considered low risk, with a 30-day mortality of 1.1%; these patients can be considered for home anticoagulation treatment with either rivaroxaban or apixaban. This patient meets none of the risk criteria, and treatment at home is reasonable."

Degree of neutropenia, acuity of onset, and presence of other abnormalities in the complete blood count, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, are helpful in differentiating the potential cause. Review of medications is important in the evaluation of neutropenia because medications are a common cause. Drug-induced neutropenia results from impairment of normal granulopoiesis in the bone marrow or through a drug-dependent, antibody-mediated immune destruction of circulating neutrophils. The thionamides propylthiouracil and methimazole are among the drugs known to cause agranulocytosis; although the overall prevalence is low (around 0.5%), the risk is higher compared with other drug classes. Agranulocytosis is more likely to occur within the first 3 months of drug initiation, is more common in women, and appears to be dose related with methimazole. The ANC should recover within 1 to 3 weeks after discontinuing the medication."

Causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome may include hypercoagulable states such as a myeloproliferative neoplasm, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, inflammatory bowel disease, or inherited thrombophilias. Underlying malignancy, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, must be considered. Typical symptoms of Budd-Chiari syndrome include hepatomegaly, ascites, and right-upper-quadrant abdominal pain. Budd-Chiari syndrome is typically diagnosed by ultrasound with Doppler, CT, or MRI in the appropriate clinical setting.

The bone marrow typically shows marked hypocellularity with a commensurate increase in fat tissue. Typically, no dysplastic features of cell maturation are seen, as would be seen in the hypocellular variant of myelodysplastic syndrome, or an increase in cellularity and immature leukocytes, as would be seen in “aleukemic” acute leukemia. Younger patients with a suitable HLA-matched donor are usually treated with allogeneic HSCT.

According to the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on VTE prevention and treatment in patients with cancer, routine pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis should not be offered to all outpatients with cancer. Increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer is measured using the Khorana score. The guideline recommends that high-risk outpatients with cancer (Khorana score of 2 or higher before starting a new systemic chemotherapy regimen) may be offered thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) provided no significant risk factors for bleeding and no drug interactions are identified. Consideration of such therapy should be accompanied by a discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and harms, drug cost, and duration of prophylaxis in this setting. The Khorana score places highest risk of VTE on gastric and pancreatic cancers (2 points), with lymphoma and lung, gynecologic, bladder, and testicular cancers also being high risk (1 point).

In patients with cancer, warfarin is not generally recommended for either primary VTE prophylaxis or treatment, although its use may be considered in patients with multiple myeloma at high risk who are treated with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide combined with other agents such as glucocorticoids, doxorubicin, or erythropoietin.

Baseline iron studies should be obtained, and serial measurements of serum ferritin can monitor iron stores, particularly if transfusion requirements increase. In addition to standard cardiac assessment with electrocardiography and echocardiography, MRI is used to monitor cardiac and hepatic iron stores. This patient has many of the manifestations of β-thalassemia, including anemia, extramedullary hematopoiesis, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow space expansion with characteristic skeletal changes. Patients often remain transfusion independent during childhood and young adulthood but require transfusions beginning in the third and fourth decades of life. Heightened gastrointestinal absorption of iron that accompanies ineffective erythropoiesis adds to the transfusion-related iron overload. Excess iron deposition in the organs can lead to arrhythmia and heart failure, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and endocrinopathies (diabetes, hypopituitarism, hypogonadism). Patients should avoid iron supplementation, and transfusions should be performed judiciously. Patients with secondary iron overload require chelation therapy with parenteral desferrioxamine or oral iron chelators (deferasirox or deferiprone) before the onset of end-organ damage."

The standard approach to patients experiencing bleeding from anticoagulants involves hemodynamic monitoring and resuscitation with fluid and blood products. Activated charcoal can be considered if the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) was ingested recently (<6 hours). She is taking dabigatran for atrial fibrillation, and the anticoagulant effects must be immediately reversed. Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to dabigatran and rapidly reverses its anticoagulant effects (within 1 hour). Idarucizumab is indicated to treat patients taking dabigatran who experience life-threatening bleeding or who require an urgent invasive procedure. If idarucizumab is not available, hemodialysis is another option. Up to 68% of dabigatran can be removed in 4 hours using hemodialysis; however, a rebound increase may follow because of redistribution of the drug."

In this patient with an unprovoked deep venous thrombosis, guidelines suggest that extended anticoagulant therapy should be considered regardless of the presence or absence of an inherited thrombophilia. The choice of extended thromboprophylaxis should be informed by bleeding risk and reevaluated each year. The choice of anticoagulant may be influenced by the presence of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, but this patient's antiphospholipid evaluation was unremarkable."

FVL can be detected by genetic testing (DNA testing) or a functional coagulation test for activated protein C resistance. Although genetic testing now would not affect immediate treatment options for this patient, testing can be performed independent of the presence of an acute thrombosis. Therapy with a direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban, dabigatran) or an oral factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) can result in falsely normal activated protein C functional test results."

"). vWD, the most common hereditary bleeding disorder, is caused by deficiency or ineffectiveness of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF promotes platelet adhesion and functions as a protective carrier protein for factor VIII, so a mild secondary decrease in factor VIII level occurs in patients with vWD. vWF deficiency leads to mucocutaneous bleeding that mimics thrombocytopenia. Menorrhagia and bleeding after minor procedures such as dental extraction or tonsillectomy are common manifestations. As in typical cases of vWD, this patient was young at the onset of bleeding symptoms and has a family history of bleeding. vWD is an autosomal-dominant disease and can affect men and women, so her family history is also consistent with this diagnosis. Although the activated partial thromboplastin time may be prolonged or normal, an abnormal platelet function testing result would suggest vWD, making this a useful initial evaluation tool. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding a reduction in von Willebrand antigen (quantitative analysis) and reduced vWF ristocetin cofactor activity (a measurement of the functional affect)."

"). He has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which has been triggered by sepsis. DIC is a systemic process with widespread and inappropriate activation of coagulation and concomitant fibrinolysis. In acute DIC, coagulation factors and platelets are rapidly consumed, leading to bleeding, organ dysfunction, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia manifesting as schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear (see figure in Stem). Normal compensatory mechanisms are unable to keep up with the consumption of many blood components, resulting in depletion of platelets and coagulation proteins. Patients may have bleeding resulting from lack of available procoagulant factors in addition to large amounts of fibrin degradation products released from accompanying fibrinolysis, which interferes with normal platelet function and fibrin formation. Bleeding can often be seen at mucosal sites and areas of procedures (e.g., venous catheters). Organ dysfunction, including kidney and liver impairment, is also common. Laboratory findings in acute DIC include prolongation of the prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times, thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen level, and markers of fibrinolysis such as an elevated D-dimer. Sepsis is the most common cause of acute DIC. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying condition. Platelet transfusions, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma are provided as needed for bleeding manifestations."

CAR-T cells can expand in the body, driven by the presence of cancer cells. The treatment is quite effective, and patients with high tumor burden, in whom the genetically engineered T cells effectively expand, may experience a severe inflammatory reaction triggered by the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, and by numerous activated lymphocytes and other immune cells. The clinical presentation of CRS can range from mild, with fever, malaise, and myalgia, to a severe inflammatory syndrome. Severe CRS requiring ICU admission is often characterized by vascular leak, hypotension, pulmonary edema, cardiac dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, liver failure, coagulopathy, multiorgan system failure, and even death. Treatment protocols include early supportive care with antipyretics for lower grades of CRS and high doses of glucocorticoids with cytokine-blocking monoclonal antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab) for higher grades of CRS.

Management of WAIHA includes stabilizing the patient, addressing any potential precipitating cause, reducing erythrocyte destruction, and eradicating the antibody. The most pressing initial intervention should address patient stabilization, which may require transfusion in those with severe anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL [70 g/L]), hemodynamic instability, or significant comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary disease; this patient has all of these complications. The autoantibodies are typically IgG, and some subtypes may fix complement. These autoantibodies are often directed against a core erythrocyte antigen component that is present, as well, on almost all donor erythrocytes, making them all crossmatch incompatible. Therefore, if crossmatch-compatible units cannot be identified, type-specific blood should be slowly transfused and the patient closely monitored.

"). This patient has Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), an IgM monoclonal gammopathy and the clinicopathologic manifestation of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The disease may be indolent and asymptomatic, or it may be associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, sweats, and weight loss. The IgM monoclonal protein is quite large and usually does not cause severe damage to the kidney, but kidney disease is found in approximately 3% of patients. Tissue infiltration leads to hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Increased serum viscosity from the circulating IgM can lead to hyperviscosity syndrome, found in approximately 30% of patients with WM. Although viscosity measurement can establish the diagnosis of hyperviscosity syndrome, treatment should be initiated based on the patient's symptoms and findings. Hyperviscosity syndrome has various manifestations such as headache, altered mental status, change in vision and hearing, nystagmus, and ataxia. Funduscopic evaluation may reveal dilated retinal veins, papilledema, and flame hemorrhages. Mucosal bleeding and petechiae are related to platelet dysfunction and dysfibrinogenemia. Symptomatic patients with hyperviscosity syndrome require urgent treatment with plasmapheresis, which efficiently removes the IgM paraprotein and reduces serum viscosity with symptom improvement. The underlying disease process requires chemotherapy directed against the malignant cells."

This increased risk is particularly true in those with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin Sβ° disease. Evidence-based care for patients with hemoglobin SS disease undergoing surgeries other than low-risk procedures is to provide simple erythrocyte transfusion. This recommendation is based on results from a clinical trial in which patients were randomized either to no transfusion or to simple transfusion to achieve a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (100 g/L) preoperatively. A significant increase in serious adverse events was seen in those who did not receive transfusion. Patients who received transfusion also had a lower incidence of developing acute chest syndrome.

A low mean corpuscular volume, elevated red-cell distribution width, and peripheral blood smear showing microcytosis and anisopoikilocytosis are virtually diagnostic of iron deficiency, especially in premenopausal women; these findings may obviate the need for additional laboratory testing provided that a follow-up blood count is performed to assess response to iron therapy. Even in developed nations, iron deficiency may be present in 20% to 30% of otherwise healthy women of childbearing age. Menstrual iron loss is the most common cause of anemia in this population. Iron deficiency anemia is also a common pregnancy complication because of the heightened iron requirements that occur in the second and third trimesters; it can be further exacerbated by inadequate oral iron intake because of nausea and vomiting. Iron deficiency is typically treated with oral iron salts. Frequent dosing (two or three times daily) of oral iron can lead to increased hepcidin production, which actually reduces iron absorption (",

"). The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a safe, effective treatment for most patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The DOACs available for use in the United States are dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. In clinical trials of patients with VTE, patients were initially treated with a parenteral agent, usually heparin, and transitioned to dabigatran or edoxaban. Rivaroxaban and apixaban were studied without concomitant parenteral therapy and are approved as monotherapy for VTE. Dabigatran functions as a direct thrombin inhibitor, whereas the other agents are factor Xa inhibitors. Advantages of DOACs include no need for routine monitoring, rapid onset of action and short half-life, fixed dosing, and fewer drug-drug interactions. These drugs are as effective as warfarin in VTE prevention; although the overall bleeding risk was comparable, less central nervous system bleeding, fatal bleeding, and use of blood product support among patients taking DOACs was seen than with warfarin. Data from a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that DOACs may be preferred to vitamin K antagonists like warfarin in patients with early stage chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m",
{
"type":"tag",

]
},
") and atrial fibrillation. A key finding was that DOACS were associated with relative risk reductions of 21% for stroke or systemic embolism, 52% for hemorrhagic stroke, and 51% for intracranial hemorrhage. Apixaban has the lowest renal elimination of the direct oral anticoagulants (25%) and can be used by patients undergoing dialysis with close monitoring. Apixaban is the only DOAC approved for use in patients on dialysis. Warfarin is an acceptable anticoagulant in patients treated with hemodialysis. It has the advantages of long clinical experience and the ability to monitor the INR and adjust the dose to maintain safe and therapeutic anticoagulation levels."

Acquired TTP is most often caused by production of an autoantibody that leads to a deficiency in the metalloprotease ADAMTS13, which is responsible for cleaving high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers. An excess of high-molecular-weight vWF multimers causes platelet clumping in the microvasculature that leads to platelet consumption and MAHA. Plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma is a crucial component of therapy that will remove the autoantibody and replace the deficient ADAMTS13. Prednisone is used to decrease continued autoantibody production. Rituximab further suppresses autoantibody production and the risk of recurrence."

Warfarin levels are monitored by prothrombin time and INR. Typically, a therapeutic warfarin level has an INR of 2 to 3. Bleeding risk increases as the INR level increases, and risk is also elevated in patients older than 75 years, in patients taking an antiplatelet agent, and in patients with previous stroke or gastrointestinal bleeding. For an INR between 4.5 and 10 in patients without bleeding, warfarin can be withheld without other treatment. In patients with an INR greater than 10 without bleeding, oral vitamin K should be given and warfarin withheld until the INR returns to a therapeutic range. However, patients with life-threatening bleeding, as in this patient, should be given 4f-PCC in addition to intravenous vitamin K. 4F-PCC is the preferred agent for warfarin reversal. If 4f-PCC is not available, then 3-factor PCC or fresh frozen plasma can be used. 4F-PCC is preferred over 3-factor PCC because it contains consistent amounts of factor VII and warfarin reversal is more reliable."

For patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), ASH suggests using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban, over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin. However, this recommendation may not apply to certain subgroups of patients, such as those with kidney disease (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, except for apixaban), moderate to severe liver disease, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In some of these patients, warfarin will be preferred. Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor. It is approved for treatment of VTE as monotherapy, without the need for initial parenteral anticoagulation. For an acute VTE, initial dosing is 10 mg twice daily for 1 week and then 5 mg twice daily thereafter. Rivaroxaban, another factor Xa inhibitor, can also be initiated without initial parenteral therapy. Both apixaban and rivaroxaban allow for discharge directly to home with oral therapy. In some instances, the cost of DOACs and the lack of insurance coverage may lead patients who do not otherwise require hospitalization to choose low-molecular-weight heparin for the acute home-based management of VTE."

In assessing patients with anemia, reviewing the complete blood count, mean corpuscular volume, and reticulocyte count along with the peripheral blood smear can provide valuable diagnostic information. Defining the anemia as microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic as well as by bone marrow response (elevated versus normal or suppressed reticulocyte production) can narrow the differential diagnosis. The reticulocyte count provides information on the marrow response to anemia. A normal marrow will produce reticulocytes in response to anemia or hypoxia. In the absence of hypoxemia (and by implication, hypoxia), anemia associated with an elevated reticulocyte count is most often secondary to bleeding or hemolysis. Hypoproliferative anemia is associated with a low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte count; in this situation, the bone marrow is abnormal or lacks substrate for erythrocyte production."

Iron overload is a significant complication for transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia major. Excess iron accumulates from repeat erythrocyte transfusions and from increased gastrointestinal absorption. Overt iron overload can be seen after transfusion of 15 to 20 units of blood. Patients requiring chronic transfusions are therefore at risk for developing secondary iron overload. Individuals should be monitored for evidence of iron overload with serial ferritin level measurements, and MRI should be considered to evaluate iron deposition in the liver or heart. Chelation therapy should begin before end-organ injury to the liver or heart is evident. Chelation has been demonstrated to reduce organ iron levels and prolong survival in patients with thalassemia. It is often initiated when the serum ferritin level exceeds 1000 ng/mL (1000 μg/L), after approximately 15 to 20 units of blood have been transfused, or with evidence of organ deposition (>3 mg of iron per gram dry weight in the liver or cardiac T2* <20 milliseconds on MRI)."

Anemia of inflammation can accompany significant infections (e.g., tuberculosis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis), inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis), and malignancies. Occasionally it can be seen in conditions such as heart failure and diabetes mellitus that are not considered chronic inflammatory diseases. This anemia is most often normochromic and normocytic or slightly microcytic. Inflammation results in release of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 from macrophages, which in turn stimulates hepcidin release from the liver. Hepcidin regulates iron balance by reducing the iron transport channel (ferroportin) on enterocytes and macrophages, leading to reduced intestinal absorption and reduced release of iron from macrophages, explaining the characteristically low serum iron level and total iron-binding capacity. The serum ferritin level is typically elevated. Management is primarily directed toward treatment of the underlying condition; in this patient, the planned wound care for the pressure ulcer and antibiotics for the osteomyelitis should be sufficient treatment."

The main diagnostic considerations for his thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy include liver disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Laboratory overlap between these diagnoses is considerable, making it difficult to differentiate them on testing alone. Additionally, they are often present simultaneously, and treatment considerations are heavily influenced by the overall clinical picture. Distinguishing between liver disease and DIC may be challenging, but measuring the factor VIII activity is a theoretical means of separating these disorders. Factor VIII is often normal or elevated in patients with liver disease because factor VIII is produced in hepatic and nonhepatic endothelial cells; however, factor VIII is consumed in DIC. A normal or elevated factor VIII level will support liver disease as the cause of this patient's coagulopathy."

"). A markedly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that fails to correct during a mixing study and a low factor VIII level suggest that the patient's postoperative bleeding is most likely caused by an acquired inhibitor to factor VIII (acquired hemophilia A). In this disorder, an autoantibody (usually IgG) against an epitope of factor VIII neutralizes its coagulation function. Acquired factor VIII inhibitors are more common in patients older than 60 years, are slightly more common in women than men, and can be associated with underlying autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) or malignancy (usually lymphoproliferative disorders); however, they may arise spontaneously as well. Patients often present with ecchymosis and soft-tissue bleeding. Treatment with activated factor VII or activated prothrombin complex concentrate is recommended because these agents activate factor X, located downstream from factor VIII in the coagulation cascade, thus bypassing the effect of the inhibitor. Treatment with factor VIII concentrate or fresh frozen plasma is ineffective because the inhibitor neutralizes the factor VIII activity in the administered product (",

However, this patient is experiencing symptomatic anemia requiring frequent transfusions. Lenalidomide has been shown to effectively decrease transfusion requirements in patients with the 5q− cytogenetic abnormality, and more than 50% of patients can become transfusion independent. By eliminating or lowering the transfusion need, lenalidomide indirectly lowers the risk of iron overload and alloimmunization. Lenalidomide may also delay leukemic transformation, leading to improved survival in patients who respond well to treatment. Patients who do not respond to lenalidomide may require salvage therapy with hypomethylating agents such as azacytidine and decitabine. These agents decrease transfusion dependence and the risk of conversion to acute myeloid leukemia."
