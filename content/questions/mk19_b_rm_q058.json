"). Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is one of the few forms of inflammatory arthritis that affects the distal interphalangeal joints. This location is also commonly affected by OA. This patient has a classic history for OA, with minimal morning stiffness, pain with increasing use, and a classic distribution in the hands (distal interphalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints). Her radiographs are also typical for OA and show no erosions. The literature confirms that 41% of patients with psoriasis who were thought to have PsA had another cause of joint pain, most commonly OA."

PsA affects up to 25% of people with psoriasis, and the associated joint disease develops after the appearance of skin changes in 85% of patients. The joint manifestation can be pauciarticular or polyarticular and can be accompanied by axial involvement. Enthesitis (inflammation where tendons/ligaments insert into bone) is seen in almost half of patients with PsA, and dactylitis is equally common. Nail changes are common and are associated with distal interphalangeal arthritis and enthesitis. These findings are not present in this patient, making PsA unlikely at this time."
