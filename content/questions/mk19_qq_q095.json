"). Pain control is a common issue in terminally ill patients. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are effective first-line strategies for mild to moderate cancer pain, although dose limits exist for both. When these medications no longer provide sufficient control or if moderate to severe pain is present, adding as-needed short-acting, immediate-release (IR) opioid therapy is appropriate. This patient has moderate pain that returns before his next scheduled dose of IR opioid therapy and requires four doses per day continuously. He would benefit from use of a sustained-release (SR) opioid. An appropriate solution would be SR morphine twice daily. A breakthrough pain strategy should be available so that the patient has options if the SR medication does not provide complete relief. When adding an SR opioid, a strategy to avoid overmedication is to give a starting dose of 30% to 50% of the patient's average 24-hour opioid dosage. The dose of the opioid for breakthrough pain is calculated as 10% of the total daily opioid dosage given as an IR opioid. Titration is more easily achieved if both SR and IR medications are the same drug."

") can be useful in treating neuropathic pain and is used in postoperative patients and patients with cancer pain as an opioid-sparing strategy. This practice is supported by only modest-quality data, which are often extrapolated from studies of other pain syndromes. Adverse effects of gabapentinoids include dizziness, disequilibrium, somnolence, weight gain, peripheral edema, and cognitive difficulties. In 2019, the FDA issued a warning that gabapentinoids may cause serious breathing difficulties in patients with respiratory risk factors, including opioid use and COPD."
