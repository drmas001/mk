"A 58-year-old man is evaluated for a 6-month history of persistent low back pain. The patient is a postal employee who first developed pain after lifting a heavy mailbag onto a truck. The pain is localized to the lumbar back, is bilateral, and does not radiate. An MRI obtained 3 months ago demonstrated minor disk herniations that did not correspond to his area of pain. He has no other symptoms, and medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He continues to work. His only medication is naproxen for pain control."

") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient with chronic low back pain. Nonpharmacologic treatment is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with acute (<4 weeks), subacute (4-12 weeks), or chronic (>12 weeks) low back pain. Multiple nonpharmacologic options are available for chronic low back pain. Evidence and systematic reviews endorse exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction (moderate-quality evidence), tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation, electromyography biofeedback, low-level laser therapy, operant conditioning, cognitive behavioral therapy, and spinal manipulation. Varying levels of predominantly weak evidence support these approaches, but associated harms are minimal."

Nonurgent surgery may be considered in patients with neurologic deficits, progressively worsening spinal stenosis, or chronic pain (with corresponding abnormalities on imaging) that has been refractory to conservative measures and has the potential to respond to surgery. This patient has no lesion that will be amenable to surgical intervention."
