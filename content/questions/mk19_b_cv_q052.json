") is recommended to prevent this patient's early readmission to the hospital. The 2019 American College of Cardiology expert consensus decision pathway for patients hospitalized with heart failure notes that up to 25% of patients are readmitted with heart failure within 30 days of the index hospitalization. Two key elements are associated with a successful transition from hospital to home: a follow-up phone call within 2 to 3 days of discharge and an office visit within 7 to 14 days of hospital discharge. The purpose of the follow-up phone call is to address signs of congestion, provide education and review adherence to the medication regimen, and confirm follow-up appointments and adequate transportation. The expert consensus decision pathway recommends a standardized approach to the follow-up telephone call, including use of a checklist to help organize the call."
