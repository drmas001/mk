") or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the thoracic aorta. The patient's symptoms and ECG are consistent with aortic stenosis, and an echocardiogram reveals a bicuspid aortic valve associated with severe aortic stenosis. Bicuspid aortic valve is frequently associated with aortopathy resulting in aneurysm, dissection, and coarctation. Because these findings may be associated with the need for surgical intervention on the aorta itself, appropriate preprocedural planning for aortic valve replacement requires careful evaluation of the thoracic aorta. The initial recommended imaging test is transthoracic echocardiography. However, MRA or CTA is indicated when morphology of the aortic sinuses, sinotubular junction, or ascending aorta cannot be assessed accurately with echocardiography, as is the case for this patient."

"In patients undergoing valve intervention with low pretest probability for coronary artery disease, CT angiography of the coronary arteries is recommended and can be performed at the same time as CT angiography of the aorta. In those with intermediate or high pretest probability of coronary disease, invasive coronary angiography is recommended to assess coronary anatomy and guide the need for and type of revascularization. However, assessment of the aorta should occur first to rule out aortic pathology, which may complicate cardiac catheterization (",
