") with intent to perform revascularization is indicated in patients with non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) who have refractory angina or hemodynamic or electrical instability. This patient's presentation is highly suggestive of NSTE-ACS given his history, physical examination findings, ischemic ECG changes, and troponin level. This patient has an intermediate TIMI risk score of 4 given his age (≥65 years); evidence of myocardial ischemia, including ischemic ECG ST-segment changes and elevated troponin level; and recurrent chest pain episodes. Compared with an ischemia-guided approach, an invasive strategy offers improved outcomes and is indicated in most patients with higher-risk ACS, with underlying patient risk determining the urgency and timing. Whereas an invasive assessment with coronary angiography and consideration of revascularization are appropriate within 25 to 72 hours of presentation in patients with a TIMI score of 3 or 4, this patient has ongoing chest discomfort refractory to standard measures; therefore, urgent angiography (within 2 hours of presentation) is indicated."
