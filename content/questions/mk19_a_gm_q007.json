The pain worsens with prolonged standing or walking long distances. He has no pain at rest or at night, and the pain does not radiate. He is otherwise well and takes acetaminophen for pain."

"). Sacroiliac joints are true synovial joints between the sacrum and ilium of the pelvis. The sacroiliac joint may be involved as part of a systemic inflammatory syndrome, such as spondyloarthritis (particularly ankylosing spondylitis) but may also be involved as an isolated musculoskeletal condition. Biomechanical factors that predispose to sacroiliac joint injury include repetitive torsional forces or unidirectional pelvic shear forces, as might occur with stepping off a curb. The diagnosis of sacroiliitis in this patient is supported by the posterior location of his hip pain and a positive FABER (Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation of the hip) test result. This test has a high specificity but low sensitivity for sacroiliitis. Therapy for sacroiliitis is similar to that for other joint pain and includes rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and possibly physical therapy."

Pain onset is usually insidious. GTPS can be differentiated from hip joint pain in that GTPS does not usually radiate to the groin or posterior hip or limit hip range of motion. Diagnosis is made by the history and by eliciting pain with palpation over the greater trochanter or reproduction of the pain when the patient takes a step up."
