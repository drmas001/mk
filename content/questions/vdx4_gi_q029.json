"The most likely diagnosis is Barrett esophagus, which is defined as the extension of the metaplastic columnar epithelium above the gastroesophageal junction into the esophagus. Endoscopically, Barrett esophagus is recognized as salmon-colored mucosa compared with the normal pearl-colored squamous mucosa above the gastroesophageal junction. Barrett esophagus is a consequence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), even in patients who experience no clinical symptoms, and is classified as a premalignant condition because it has the potential to progress to esophageal cancer. Risk factors associated with Barrett esophagus include chronic GERD (>5 years), older than age 50 years, male sex, tobacco use, and obesity."
