Between events, she engages in usual daily activities with no limitations. She has no other pertinent history and takes no medications."

") is the most appropriate diagnostic testing option for this patient with palpitations. Event monitors are patient-triggered devices that are ideally suited to capture symptomatic arrhythmias. The choice of ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitor depends on the frequency and duration of the symptoms as well as any other associated symptoms, signs, or findings. For patients such as this one, with symptoms that occur frequently over the course of a month but not daily, a 30-day event monitor is most appropriate. The patient can activate the monitor when symptoms occur, provided that the symptoms last long enough to be captured by the device's active and retrospective capture. Symptoms that last longer than 1 to 2 minutes are ideally suited for event monitors."

MCT is not indicated for this patient whose symptoms have not yet been correlated to any specific arrhythmia; thus, quantification of arrhythmia burden is unnecessary at this time. MCT is often used to capture arrhythmias that may not be associated with symptoms (e.g., occult atrial fibrillation), but this patient's symptom complex seems fairly reproducible. Furthermore, her symptoms occur frequently enough that an event monitor would be the most resource-appropriate test to order at this time."
