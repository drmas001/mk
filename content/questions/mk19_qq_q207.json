") secondary to atorvastatin is the most likely diagnosis. Drug-induced myopathy is an important and treatable cause of subacute myopathy. Statins and other lipid-lowering agents, including fibrates such as gemfibrozil and fenofibrate, can cause muscle-related symptoms that range from asymptomatic hyperCKemia and mild myalgia to progressive myopathy and, in rare cases, rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of these agents; age older than 65 years; use of higher doses of statins; and coexisting kidney disease, liver disease, or hypothyroidism can increase the risk for myopathy. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels can be normal, mildly, or highly elevated in statin myopathy. The lipophilic statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin) have a higher propensity to cause myopathy than the hydrophilic agents (pravastatin and rosuvastatin). The risk for myopathy increases with higher dosages, the addition of fenofibrate or gemfibrozil, and the addition of cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme inhibitors. Other toxins and drugs known to cause toxic myopathy include alcohol, cyclosporine, amiodarone, hydroxychloroquine, antiretroviral drugs, glucocorticoids, and immune checkpoint inhibitors."

") is a uniformly insidious condition and is usually easily distinguishable from the other inflammatory myopathies because of its very slow onset and pattern of muscle involvement. Patients typically report a history of preexisting weakness averaging 5 years. Although proximal muscle involvement is present, distal muscle involvement also occurs, distinguishing it from polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Muscle distribution is typically symmetric, but asymmetry may occur. On physical examination, muscle weakness and atrophy are often present in the hip flexors, quadriceps, finger flexors, and forearm flexors. Serum CK levels are elevated."

Activities such as arising from a chair, stair climbing, and lifting objects above shoulder height are typically affected. Neck flexors are also commonly involved. Muscle pain and tenderness, if present, are mild. Muscle atrophy is a late manifestation. Weakness of respiratory muscles may also occur. Serum CK is almost universally elevated in polymyositis and is a marker of muscle damage."
