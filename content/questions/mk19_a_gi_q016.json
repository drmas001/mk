"). The patient has acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three criteria: (1) acute-onset abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, (2) serum lipase or amylase levels elevated at least three times the upper limit of normal, and (3) characteristic imaging findings. She received intravenous resuscitation overnight, which typically consists of 250 to 500 mL/h of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution, with fluid boluses as needed for severe volume depletion. Treatment with intravenous fluids should be aimed at avoiding hypovolemia and maintaining adequate organ perfusion. Goal-directed therapy allows for titration of fluids to particular biochemical and clinical targets, including blood pressure, pulse rate, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, and hematocrit. This patient initially had risk factors for severe disease, including a hematocrit greater than 44%, which has improved with volume resuscitation. Overall, her pain is improving and oral feeding should therefore be considered. Patients with acute pancreatitis should resume feeding when pain improves and any nausea or vomiting subsides. Oral feeding is preferred, and guidelines recommend starting oral feeding within 24 hours."

More recent data suggest that nasogastric tube placement and feedings are easier to administer than nasojejunal feeding and are as efficacious. In this patient, however, oral feeding should be attempted before enteral feeding is considered."

Although complications of pancreatitis may include gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., splenic vein thrombus leading to varices or pseudoaneurysm formation followed by rupture of an arterial wall), this patient is hemodynamically stable and does not exhibit signs or symptoms of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. She was intravascularly depleted at the time of hospitalization, and fluid resuscitation led to an expected decrease in hematocrit."
