"). If the PTH level is high or “inappropriately” normal, primary hyperparathyroidism is the diagnosis.

Because PTH enhances kidney phosphate excretion, low or low-normal serum phosphorus concentrations support the diagnosis."

"One of the ways in which PTH increases the serum calcium level is by upregulation of the 1α-hydroxylase enzyme, which stimulates conversion of vitamin D to its most active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This form of vitamin D increases the percentage of dietary calcium absorbed by the intestine. Body stores of vitamin D are assessed by measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which has a long half-life. Measurement of this patient's 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels (",

") is not necessary if the serum albumin or corrected total calcium levels are normal, there are no acute acid-base disorders, or there is no evidence of paraproteinemia, such as multiple myeloma (anemia, kidney injury, low anion gap). In most clinical situations, measured calcium levels depend on the amount bound to albumin, which may be affected by nutrition and acid-base status. When albumin concentration is low, ionized calcium measurement or corrected total calcium calculation is required to accurately assess calcium levels. This patient's albumin level is normal, and she has symptoms of hypercalcemia; ionized calcium does not need to be measured."
