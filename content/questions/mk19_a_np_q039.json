"), an ACE inhibitor, to treat hypertension in this patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuria. Although this patient's serum creatinine level is normal, she has evidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on the presence of albuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g). Albuminuria and uncontrolled blood pressure increase her risk for progression of CKD. Several large randomized controlled trials showed that use of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can result in decreased progression of albuminuria and CKD, which may include doubling of serum creatinine or progression to end-stage kidney disease, in patients with diabetes and albuminuria."

Regardless, the patient is not >20/10 mm Hg above her blood pressure target, and the initiation of two antihypertensive drugs is not indicated. However, if this patient's blood pressure is still not controlled to target while receiving the maximum dose of lisinopril, then another class of first-line antihypertensive agents, such as a thiazide diuretic or CCB, should be added."
