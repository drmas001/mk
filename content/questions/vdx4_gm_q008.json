"Photosensitivity disorder is the most likely diagnosis. The sparing of the area that was photo-protected by a wristwatch helps establish this diagnosis. Photosensitivity disorders are characterized by an abnormal skin response following exposure to ultraviolet radiation. They are often categorized as idiopathic or related to the application or ingestion of an external agent, such as topical application of an agent or drug ingestion. Photosensitivity reactions related to exogenous agents are phototoxic or photoallergic. Phototoxicity can occur in anyone with a threshold concentration of the responsible chemical or drug and is more common than photoallergy. Phototoxic reactions present as an exaggerated sunburn within minutes to hours of sun exposure. Photoallergy is a cell-mediated immune response found in previously sensitized individuals and can be elicited by re-exposure to small amounts of offending agent. Photoallergic reactions occur more commonly after topical exposure of a sensitizing agent and presents as pruritic, eczematous eruptions within 24 to 48 hours after sun exposure. A history of culprit drug ingestion or topical applications of a sensitizer and the timing of the reaction after sun exposure help differentiate between idiopathic, phototoxic, and photoallergic disorders."
