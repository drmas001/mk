") is appropriate for this patient with an incidental finding of gallstones, which is a frequent finding when patients undergo CT or ultrasonography of the abdomen. This patient has no symptoms of gallstone disease or imaging findings concerning for complications of gallstone disease. Approximately 10% to 20% of the population in most Western countries has gallstones; among them, 50% to 70% are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Asymptomatic gallstone disease has a benign natural course; 80% of patients remain symptom-free over the next 15 years. Patients rarely develop gallstone-related complications without first having at least one episode of biliary pain (colic); thus, it is appropriate to manage this patient with observation and to manage symptoms if they arise."

Among asymptomatic patients, cholecystectomy is indicated for patients at high risk for gallbladder cancer, such as those with gallstones greater than 3 cm in size, porcelain gallbladder (intramural calcification of the gallbladder wall), gallbladder adenomas or polyps greater than 1 cm in size, or anomaly of pancreatic ductal drainage. In the absence of either symptoms or concerning findings on imaging, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not indicated. Likewise, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is not indicated in this patient."
