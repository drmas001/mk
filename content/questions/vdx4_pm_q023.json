") in the mid-lung section. Chest radiography can demonstrate diffuse micronodular disease but may be normal. Repetitive inhalation of antigens in a sensitized patient can result in HP, an immunologic response that results in noncaseating granulomas and peribronchial mononuclear cell infiltration with giant cells. The antigens are typically complex proteins, which can come from several sources. There are three forms of HP, and they each present differently. The acute form, which is most easily identified, results after a large exposure to an inciting antigen. The patient will develop fevers, cough, and fatigue, typically within 12 hours of exposure."
