"). During seasonal influenza activity, testing for influenza should occur in patients at high risk who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness if the testing result will influence clinical management. Other outpatient candidates for testing include those who present with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and either exacerbation of chronic medical conditions or known complications of influenza, such as pneumonia, if the testing result will influence clinical management. During times of influenza activity, testing for influenza at hospital admission is recommended for all patients with acute respiratory infection and in patients with acute worsening of chronic cardiopulmonary disease. In all cases, treatment decisions should not be delayed pending confirmatory results. When influenza is prevalent, influenza testing is not needed for otherwise healthy outpatients with compatible findings."
