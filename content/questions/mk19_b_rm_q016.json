"A 78-year-old man is evaluated at a follow-up visit. Two weeks ago, he presented with severe new-onset headaches, claudicative jaw pain, and proximal myalgia of all four limbs. He was diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed giant cell arteritis, and prednisone, 60 mg/d, was initiated. Since initiation of prednisone, his presenting symptoms have improved but he has also developed mood swings, insomnia, significant hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, and dependent edema. His other medical problems are type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Other current medications are aspirin, metformin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, losartan, and hydrochlorothiazide."

"). Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a medical emergency that requires immediate therapy. The risk for sudden and irreversible loss of vision is imminent in the absence of appropriate treatment. Symptoms and inflammatory markers usually respond rapidly to glucocorticoids. However, glucocorticoids have many adverse effects, and this patient will benefit from the addition of a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Generally accepted indications for a glucocorticoid-sparing agent include the presence of comorbid diseases that are negatively affected by glucocorticoids, development of glucocorticoid-related adverse effects, and prolonged need for treatment. This patient meets all indications for a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 blocker, is highly effective for the treatment of GCA when administered during glucocorticoid tapering or as monotherapy following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. The 2021 American College of Rheumatology guidelines make a conditional recommendation for glucocorticoids with tocilizumab over oral glucocorticoids alone in patients with newly diagnosed GCA."
