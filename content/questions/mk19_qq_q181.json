") before his total left hip arthroplasty. Patients at highest risk for perioperative cardiac complications are those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Risk factors that predispose to higher risk for a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) include ischemic heart disease, compensated heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) are commonly used, in conjunction with validated risk assessment tools, such as the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, to assess risk for MACE. This patient has cardiovascular risk factors, an estimated risk for MACE of greater than 1%, and no reliable means of assessing his functional capacity. In this situation, or if his assessed functional capacity was less than four metabolic equivalents, it is reasonable to perform additional testing. The ACC/AHA recommends noninvasive pharmacological stress testing (either dobutamine stress echocardiography or pharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging) if testing will change management."

") may be used with dobutamine to assess wall motion abnormalities or with vasodilators to assess perfusion. It is commonly performed to evaluate degree of infarction. Viability can be determined by evaluating the extent of myocardial fibrosis within the left ventricle. Measures of right and left ventricular function can be obtained with gating. CMR imaging is limited by operator expertise, length of time for image acquisition, and availability and is not the best initial or recommended diagnostic test for this patient."
