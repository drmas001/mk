"). Among patients aged 55 years or older with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of undetermined source, occult intermittent atrial fibrillation (AF) is thought to be present in up to 25% of cases, and prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring may be indicated for detection. According to the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society AF focused update, in a patient with an ischemic stroke of unknown cause in whom external ambulatory ECG monitoring is inconclusive, implantation of a cardiac monitor (loop recorder) is reasonable to optimize detection of silent AF (class 2a recommendation). The 2019 guideline on the management of acute stroke from the American Heart Association/American Academy of Neurology notes that the effectiveness of prolonged cardiac monitoring during hospitalization after acute ischemic stroke to guide treatment selection for prevention of recurrent stroke is uncertain. However, there is some practice variation regarding the duration of “prolonged” monitoring and the burden of detected, asymptomatic AF that warrants anticoagulation. Also, the sequence of evaluation varies—for example, extended rhythm monitoring first versus testing for intracardiac shunt with transesophageal echocardiography."
