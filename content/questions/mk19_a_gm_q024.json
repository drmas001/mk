"). Patients aged 75 years or younger with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) should be prescribed high-intensity statin therapy (rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) as secondary prevention. Clinical ASCVD is defined as acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary artery revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease. The goal of drug therapy is to decrease the LDL cholesterol level by 50% or more; however, therapy in this patient population should be started regardless of initial LDL cholesterol level. LDL cholesterol should be measured again in approximately 6 to 8 weeks to ensure adherence to the medication regimen and successful lowering of cholesterol levels. If the patient does not tolerate high-intensity statin therapy because of statin-associated adverse effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated, with the aim of decreasing LDL cholesterol by 30% to 49%."
