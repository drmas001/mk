He and his spouse report no signs and symptoms of depression. In high school and in college he was on the boxing team. He is otherwise well and takes no medications."

") includes patients with clear symptoms of cognitive decline who do not meet criteria for dementia. The formal criteria for MCI are a subjective report (from either the patient or a witness) of a decline in cognitive abilities with relative preservation of day-to-day function and evidence of cognitive impairment on cognitive testing. Because of wide variability in the risk of progression, steps should be taken to confirm the underlying cause of the symptoms. In patients with cognitive impairment lasting more than 3 months, evaluation should include laboratory testing for potentially reversible conditions. Examples include assessment for medication adverse events, sleep apnea, depression, and other common medical conditions and an MRI without contrast."
