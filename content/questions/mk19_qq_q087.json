"). Constipation can present as infrequent, difficult, or incomplete defecation. It can be acute or chronic and either secondary or idiopathic in nature. Medications are the most common cause of secondary constipation. The history should include an assessment for the presence of alarm features: hematochezia, acute constipation in elderly patients, unintentional weight loss, family history of colorectal cancer, unexplained anemia, and age older than 50 years with no previous colonoscopy. Anorectal examination, including a digital examination during Valsalva maneuver, is an important part of the physical examination because it may identify anatomic or functional causes of an evacuation disorder. A flat plate radiograph of the abdomen is the most useful initial study because it can assess for the presence and distribution of excessive stool in the colon and/or rectum. Initial treatment includes diet and lifestyle changes (adequate water intake, dietary fiber, exercise), medication review, and evaluating for underlying endocrine, metabolic, neuropathic, or mechanical causes. Treatment options include bulking agents (first line), osmotic laxatives (second line), stimulant laxatives (rescue if no bowel movements), secretagogues, and/or biofeedback. The evidence for treatment efficacy is strongest for PEG and the secretagogues lubiprostone and linaclotide. For refractory cases of constipation, combination therapy should include agents with different mechanisms of action, such as an osmotic laxative plus a stimulant laxative."
