") for patients at higher risk for bleeding, such as this patient taking rivaroxaban. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and colorectal cancer in willing adults aged 50 to 59 years with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher, a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and no increased risk for bleeding. This patient has a 10-year ASCVD risk greater than 10% and may be considered for aspirin therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD. Tempering the recommendation for primary prevention of ASCVD with aspirin are multiple trials, including ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE, and a 2019 meta-analysis showing no net mortality benefit with aspirin; reductions in nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke were offset by an increased risk for major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. Factors that increase risk for bleeding include increasing age, male sex, concurrent anticoagulant or NSAID use, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, upper gastrointestinal pain, uncontrolled hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and thrombocytopenia. Because of these data, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommended that aspirin should be used infrequently in primary prevention of ASCVD and that low-dose (81 mg/d) aspirin (",
