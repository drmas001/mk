"), the most common form of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVTs are rapid heart rhythms that arise from the atrium or require conduction through the atrioventricular node. SVTs usually occur in the absence of structural heart disease, although echocardiography should be performed to exclude underlying cardiac dysfunction or structural defects. Patients often have repeated episodes of tachycardia and may report palpitations, a sensation of pounding in the neck, fatigue, light-headedness, chest discomfort, dyspnea, presyncope, and, less commonly, syncope. AVNRT accounts for approximately two thirds of all cases of SVT. It frequently occurs in women and is often terminated by performing vagal maneuvers, as with this patient. The ECG typically demonstrates a narrow QRS complex. AVNRT is characterized by a short RP interval with a retrograde P wave ",
