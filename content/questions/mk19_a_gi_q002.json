"). This patient most likely has primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a diagnosis that is best established by imaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to exclude extrahepatic obstruction and by positive results for AMA. PBC is an autoimmune disease affecting the small and medium bile ducts. It is often asymptomatic but can present with pruritus and fatigue. PBC is more common in women than men (female-to-male ratio is 9:1). Typically, the alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in PBC; if it is at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, a positive result on an AMA test establishes the diagnosis without the need for liver biopsy. Patients with PBC who are negative for AMA may test positive for other PBC-specific autoantibodies, including sp100 and gp210. Once PBC is diagnosed, first-line treatment is ursodeoxycholic acid, which results in histologic improvement, improves survival rates, and diminishes the need for liver transplantation."

"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an autoimmune fibroinflammatory disease, primarily of large bile ducts. PSC is more common in men than in women and is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in about 85% of cases. PSC should be suspected in patients with IBD who have elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Some patients may also have elevated serum total bilirubin levels or total protein, reflecting the presence of hypergammaglobulinemia. PSC is associated with many autoantibodies, including anti–smooth muscle antibody (",
