He reports that his handwriting has become illegible. Previous treatment with propranolol, primidone, and clonazepam did not improve these symptoms. He also has a history of kidney stones. Family history includes tremor in his brother and Parkinson disease in his uncle. He takes no medications."

There are no involuntary movements when hands are placed on the chair arms. Rapid alternative movements, tone, and gait are normal."

"). This patient has severe medication-refractory essential tremor. Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder, affecting 1% to 2% of the population. It is defined as an isolated tremor syndrome of at least 3 years' duration characterized by action tremor in the upper extremities, with or without involvement of other body parts, such as the head, larynx, or lower limbs. A family history of tremor is present in 50% of patients. First-line treatment for essential tremor includes propranolol, primidone, and topiramate. Clonazepam is a second-line treatment. In this patient, propranolol, primidone, and clonazepam have already proved ineffective, and topiramate (",

") is contraindicated because of his history of kidney stones. Surgical therapies, including deep-brain stimulation (unilateral or bilateral) and focused ultrasound thalamotomy (only unilateral), can control tremor in refractory essential tremor associated with functional disability. Results of a randomized trial suggest that deep-brain stimulation results in greater functional improvements than thalamotomy and fewer adverse events, such as dysarthria, sensory disturbances, and gait disturbances."
