") is the most appropriate management option for this patient. All women with Marfan syndrome have an increased risk for pregnancy-related aortic dissection and rupture. To reduce this risk, aortic repair surgery is recommended before conception for women with Marfan syndrome who have an ascending aortic diameter greater than 4.0 cm and risk factors for aortic dissection, such as a family or personal history of aortic dissection or aortic dilatation of more than 5 mm per year. Pregnancy is considered low risk if the aortic diameter is smaller than 4.0 cm. This patient has both a family history of aortic dissection and evidence of an expanding aneurysm; aortic repair before attempting pregnancy should be advised."

Population studies suggest that there may be an increase in congenital central nervous system and limb abnormalities with exposure to lipophilic statins during the first trimester. Starting atorvastatin and continuing with pregnancy is not recommended."

Exposure to these agents during the first trimester may cause central nervous system and cardiovascular malformations; exposure during the second trimester may lead to urogenital and renal developmental malformations.
