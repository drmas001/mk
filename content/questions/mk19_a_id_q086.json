"). The patient's symptoms are worrisome for acute retroviral syndrome, and acute HIV infection must be ruled out before proceeding with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The HIV p24 antigen and HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody detection tests have significantly reduced the window period (time from exposure to positive screening test) from previous tests. However, in the setting of acute retroviral syndrome, screening tests could be negative if performed too early in the course of infection. With his symptoms of fatigue, body aches, and sore throat and findings of lymphadenopathy, which could be related to acute retroviral syndrome, the most appropriate testing following the negative HIV antigen/antibody combination assay would be HIV-1 RNA NAAT."
