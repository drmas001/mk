Three days ago, she was evaluated for a 1-week history of a nonpruritic rash that appears to be resolving since the initial evaluation. The patient reports no recent history of oral or genital ulcers. She is transgender. She has multiple sexual partners (men and women) and reports consistent use of condoms except for oral sex. Medical history is notable for two instances of gonorrhea and treatment for early latent syphilis 1 year ago. Medications are combination tenofovir-emtricitabine."

"). The clinical manifestations of secondary syphilis can resolve without treatment. Systemic symptoms and generalized lymphadenopathy are common, and epitrochlear lymph nodes are characteristic. The absence of a history of genital or oral ulcers does not exclude the possibility of syphilis because chancres are painless and may heal spontaneously without being noticed. Because the patient has a documented history of syphilis, it is expected that an enzyme immunoassay result would remain positive; however, the significant increase in the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer indicates a new infection. In this transgender woman at high risk for STI, if she were unlikely to return for follow up, the clinical presentation would support providing empiric therapy for syphilis before laboratory results returned. This patient should be counseled about the risk for STIs related to unprotected oral sex, and condoms and dental dams should be recommended to reduce this risk. The patient should have follow-up syphilis serology testing at 6 and 12 months, with an expected four-fold decrease in the RPR titer by 12 months."
