"). This patient has polyuria, a serum sodium concentration at the upper limit of normal, and dilute urine, which establish the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI). DI may be secondary to either an inadequate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (central DI) or inadequate action of ADH (nephrogenic DI). Central DI can result from tumors that invade the hypothalamus, infiltrating diseases such as sarcoidosis, or surgical destruction. Nephrogenic DI is often caused by drugs such as lithium. The temporal association with the initiation of lithium in this patient establishes the diagnosis of lithium-induced nephrogenic DI. Up to 40% of patients treated with lithium will develop polydipsia secondary to lithium interfering with the action of ADH. Amiloride is the most appropriate management in this case, as it blocks the epithelial sodium channel in the collecting tubule and prevents the uptake of lithium by these cells. Intracellular lithium appears to decrease the number of aquaporin water channels inserted in the membrane, thereby decreasing water reabsorption causing increased excretion of dilute urine. If amiloride is ineffective and lithium must be continued, the treatment of nephrogenic DI is aimed at decreasing the amount of urine excreted and is best accomplished by limiting solute intake and causing mild volume depletion with the use of a thiazide diuretic. Because the amount of urine excreted daily is dependent on solute intake and minimum urine osmolality, decreasing solute will limit urine volume. By causing mild volume depletion with a thiazide diuretic, more salt and water will be reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, further decreasing urine output."
