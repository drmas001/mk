Bronchiectasis is a chronic obstructive lung disease that results from enlargement of the airways, which leads to chronic inflammation, recurrent infection, and ineffective airway clearance. Bronchiectasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with a chronic cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Other possible symptoms include hemoptysis, wheezing, and chest pain. Initial evaluation of patients with bronchiectasis should include testing for common causes, including abnormal immune function (by measuring immunoglobulin levels) and connective tissue disease. Patients should also be evaluated for other causes of bronchiectasis depending on their presentation, including cystic fibrosis, ciliary dysfunction, Î±",
