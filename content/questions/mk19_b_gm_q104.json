"). High-quality evidence to guide perioperative medication management is lacking. Recommendations are largely derived from theoretical drug interactions and expert consensus. Although most medications are tolerated throughout the perioperative period, there are some important exceptions. For example, the American College of Rheumatology recommends that biologic medications should be withheld as close to one dosing cycle as scheduling permits before elective hip and knee arthroplasty and restarted after evidence of wound healing, typically 14 days. Nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide) may be continued throughout the perioperative period. Methotrexate is administered once weekly, most commonly by oral or subcutaneous routes. Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have demonstrated that continuing DMARDs, including methotrexate, through the perioperative period is safe without an increase in infection rate (",

"). Cessation of these agents may cause rebound tachycardia and promote dysrhythmias in the perioperative period because of the elevated adrenergic tone from pain, stress, and volume shifts. Preoperative initiation of β-blockers is generally reserved for patients with a Revised Cardiac Risk Index score of 3 or more without contraindications (such as resting bradycardia or hypotension) and who have enough time before surgery to trial medications (>1 week) to ensure safety and tolerability."

"Sufficient evidence has demonstrated benefits of statin agents, such as atorvastatin, during the perioperative period. Pleiotropic effects of these agents are believed to be responsible for numerous benefits in major surgeries, presumably due to anti-inflammatory properties. Statins have been consistently associated with lower risk for cardiovascular complications in both cardiac and noncardiac surgery. In surgeries with highest cardiovascular risk (major vascular, cardiothoracic), it is reasonable to start a statin preoperatively if the patient is not already taking one. This recommendation does not apply for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, as is this case for this patient; if a patient has been on long-term statin therapy, it should be continued."
