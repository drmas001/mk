"). The patient has an acute-onset severe headache that differs from her migraine episodes. Red flags for secondary headache include abrupt onset, new headache in a patient older than 50 years, and a fundamental change in headache pattern. The abrupt nature in this patient's headache is characteristic of a “thunderclap” headache, which is defined as a severe attack of headache pain developing abruptly and reaching maximum intensity within 1 minute. Thunderclap headache is a medical emergency that warrants immediate diagnostic evaluation. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most common cause of thunderclap headache, is discovered in nearly 25% of affected patients. Noncontrast head CT should be performed without delay. The differential diagnosis of thunderclap headache also includes intracranial venous or sinus thrombosis, cervical artery dissection, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack."
