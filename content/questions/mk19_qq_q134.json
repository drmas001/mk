He also has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol combination inhaler."

") is an appropriate treatment for this patient with postherpetic neuralgia, a form of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often described as burning, stabbing, prickling, or having a “pins and needles” quality. First-line pharmacologic therapies for patients with neuropathic pain include the gabapentinoids gabapentin or pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, or the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors duloxetine or venlafaxine. Topical therapies, such as lidocaine or capsaicin, can be used as adjuncts, especially if the pain is localized. Neuropathic pain results from a maladaptive response to damage sustained to the sensory nervous system, in this case caused by herpes zoster. Other common causes of neuropathic pain include diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, stroke, nerve trauma, and spinal cord injury."

Prednisone is not generally effective for patients with chronic pain due to postherpetic neuralgia, and prolonged use is associated with significant adverse effects."
