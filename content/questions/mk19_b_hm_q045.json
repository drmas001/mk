"). Although identification of the inherited thrombophilias has advanced the understanding of venous thromboembolism (VTE) pathophysiology, it has little influence on clinical management, which does not differ acutely based on the presence of an inherited thrombophilia. Management duration is typically determined by whether the VTE event was provoked by a reversible or self-limited insult. In this patient with an unprovoked deep venous thrombosis, guidelines suggest that extended anticoagulant therapy should be considered regardless of the presence or absence of an inherited thrombophilia. The choice of extended thromboprophylaxis should be informed by bleeding risk and reevaluated each year. The choice of anticoagulant may be influenced by the presence of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, but this patient's antiphospholipid evaluation was unremarkable."

"Antithrombin III (ATIII) is a natural anticoagulant that can lead to thrombophilia in the setting of an inherited or acquired deficiency.

ATIII is reduced during an acute VTE, and measurement at this time would not provide useful information (",

"). Heterozygous FVL is most common in patients of European ancestry, affecting up to 5% of this population. FVL can be detected by genetic testing (DNA testing) or a functional coagulation test for activated protein C resistance. Although genetic testing now would not affect immediate treatment options for this patient, testing can be performed independent of the presence of an acute thrombosis. Therapy with a direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban, dabigatran) or an oral factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) can result in falsely normal activated protein C functional test results."
