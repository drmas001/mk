" infection. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) defines dyspepsia as predominant epigastric pain for at least 1 month. Other symptoms, such as early satiety, nausea, and vomiting, also may be present. The diagnosis of functional dyspepsia requires negative results on upper endoscopy and other tests for organic diseases. Given the low incidence of malignancy and with consideration given to the cost-effectiveness of evaluating dyspepsia in younger adults, the ACG and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) have jointly recommended routine use of upper endoscopy only in patients aged 60 years and older to exclude malignancy. The ACG/CAG guidelines recommend against routine use of upper endoscopy in patients younger than 60 years with dyspepsia, even in most patients with alarm features (weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, and vomiting) because these features poorly predict organic structural pathology, such as malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, or esophagitis. Consideration of endoscopy at a younger age is reasonable for patients at higher risk of malignancy, such as those with childhood years spent in a region where gastric cancer is endemic (Asia, Russia, and South America) or those with a positive family history."
