") is the most appropriate colorectal screening test for this patient. There is significant variation among colorectal cancer screening guidelines. The American College of Physicians suggests colonoscopy every 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus FIT every 2 years, or FIT or high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing every 2 years as acceptable screening regimens. In contrast, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), an initiative of U.S. gastroenterology societies, has ranked colorectal cancer screening tests in tiers based on the available evidence, cost-effectiveness, test availability, and several other factors. The MSTF recommends colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT as first-tier tests; CT colonography every 5 years, FIT-fecal DNA testing every 3 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years as second-tier tests; and capsule colonography every 5 years as a third-tier test. Screening would be most appropriate among adults who (1) are healthy enough to undergo treatment if colorectal cancer is detected and (2) do not have comorbid conditions that would significantly limit their life expectancy. Because there are no head-to-head comparisons of the various screening modalities for colorectal cancer, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force makes a practical recommendation that the best screening modality is the one the patient is willing to complete. For this patient, FIT may have certain desirable advantages. FIT has improved accuracy compared with guaiac fecal occult blood test and does not require bowel preparation, anesthesia, or transportation to and from the screening examination."
