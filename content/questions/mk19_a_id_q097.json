He was improving but developed increasing fever and hypotension 2 days ago. Repeat blood cultures were obtained, a subclavian catheter was removed, and the tip was cultured."

"). The presence of yeast cells in the blood and on the catheter indicates candidemia. Commonly encountered risk factors for candidemia include central venous or hemodialysis-associated catheters, gastrointestinal surgery, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, ICU stay or mechanical ventilation for more than 3 days, transplantation, and neutropenia. Only 40% to 60% of patients have positive blood culture results. The T2 magnetic resonance assay of whole blood provides rapid diagnosis of culture-negative invasive candidal infections. The β-D-glucan assay can be used also to diagnose invasive candidiasis in patients with negative blood culture results. These assays should be obtained when a patient at high risk receiving antimicrobial agents is not responding to therapy."
