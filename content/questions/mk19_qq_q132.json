") level. Patients typically have mild or no symptoms of hypothyroidism. The causes of subclinical hypothyroidism are generally considered the same as for overt hypothyroidism. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have mild elevations in serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and even C-reactive protein levels, and some meta-analyses have shown an increased risk for atherosclerosis and cardiac events. Two percent to 4% of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism progress to overt hypothyroidism yearly, whereas in one third of patients, thyroid function will spontaneously revert to normal. The normal range for TSH increases with age, and a TSH level of up to 7.9 µU/mL (7.9 mU/L) is within the normal range for persons 80 years of age and older. Thus, it is reasonable to repeat the thyroid function studies in 6 months."

Treatment is recommended when serum TSH levels are greater than 10 µU/mL (10 mU/L; or possibly ≥20 µU/mL [20 mU/L]). This recommendation does not apply to women who are pregnant, and it may not apply to younger patients (age <30 years). Levothyroxine also may be considered for patients who have marked symptoms, a goiter, or positive serum thyroid peroxidase antibody titers. This patient is asymptomatic (except for mild fatigue) and in good health. His clinical examination findings are normal and thus support the concept that he does not require exogenous levothyroxine."
