His most recent temperature in the evening was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F). The fever is accompanied by a salmon-pink macular rash on the trunk and arms, which resolves with the fever. He has no history of travel. Current medication is acetaminophen."

"). This patient's symptoms (daily evening fevers accompanied by salmon-pink rash, inflammatory arthritis, sore throat, and serositis) and laboratory evidence of high inflammatory markers and leukocytosis are most consistent with AOSD, a condition of unknown cause. His high serum ferritin level, although not specific, is fairly characteristic of AOSD. Because no specific test exists for AOSD, it remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and other causes should be considered. Past treatment options for AOSD, including glucocorticoids and methotrexate, were frequently inadequate. The use of interleukin-β–directed biologic therapies, including anakinra and canakinumab, has been successful. Anti–interleukin-6 therapies have shown promise."
