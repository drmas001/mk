"). Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a common opportunistic infection in solid organ transplant recipients or older adults. VZV reactivation (shingles) presents with pain or paresthesias in a specific dermatome; the characteristic rash develops several days later. In order of frequency, the thoracic, trigeminal, lumbar, and cervical cutaneous dermatomes are most often involved. VZV can present without the typical vesicular rash (zoster sine herpete), the absence of which should not deter physicians from ordering polymerase chain reaction testing for VZV in the appropriate clinical settings (e.g., central nervous system infections). Immunosuppressed patients, including pregnant women, can present with multiple dermatomes affected (disseminated cutaneous disease) or with disseminated visceral disease, which is associated with a high mortality rate. Patients with disseminated cutaneous disease may have disseminated visceral disease. Disseminated cutaneous zoster may also appear as a generalized eruption. Most patients with VZV can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral medications. However, immunocompromised patients with disseminated or otherwise severe herpes zoster should be admitted to the hospital for intravenous acyclovir."
