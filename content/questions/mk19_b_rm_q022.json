"). This rare large-vessel vasculitis disproportionately affects young women and is much more common in East Asia (prevalence is 40/million in Japan and up to 8/million elsewhere). Onset is usually indolent, with nonspecific symptoms and signs presenting months to years before onset of frank vasculitis. The disease causes inflammation and subsequent stenoses in the large arteries, including the aorta and its branches. Manifestations can include limb ischemia and associated diminished (or absent) pulses, mesenteric ischemia, and hypertension due to renal artery stenosis. Clues on examination include bruits over large vessels, absent pulses, discrepancy in blood pressure between limbs, and hypertension. Laboratory findings indicate active systemic inflammation but are not diagnostic. Imaging of the aorta and its branches is diagnostic; biopsy of an involved vessel is not feasible. Thirty percent of patients can present with ocular involvement, much of which is attributed to Takayasu retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy."

"). Although PAN can cause renal artery stenosis leading to hypertension, as well as mesenteric ischemia, it affects medium-sized vessels and so would not involve the subclavian artery. In addition, the most common manifestations of PAN are cutaneous findings (such as palpable purpura) and neurologic involvement. Roughly 70% of patients with PAN have neurologic disease, most commonly manifesting as mononeuritis multiplex. Unlike in Takayasu arteritis, pulselessness is not characteristic of PAN."
