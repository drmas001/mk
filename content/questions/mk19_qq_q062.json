"). The clinical hallmarks of acute osteomyelitis, namely local pain and fever, are often absent in patients with chronic contiguous osteomyelitis, necessitating the use of radiographic studies to confirm the diagnosis. Plain radiography is not adequately sensitive to exclude a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, but it is recommended during initial evaluation if symptoms have been present for at least 2 weeks because of the relatively low cost. The specificity of plain radiography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis in most patients. If a plain radiograph is not diagnostic, MRI, with and without intravenous contrast, is preferred."

MRI can also detect soft tissue abscesses and epidural, paravertebral, or psoas abscesses that may require surgical drainage. However, false-positive MRI results may occur in patients with noninfectious conditions, such as fractures, tumors, and healed osteomyelitis."
