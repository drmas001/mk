"). Positive and negative predictive values reflect the ability of a test to predict the presence or absence of disease in a specific population. The positive predictive value is the proportion of persons with a positive test result who have the disease. Stated another way, the positive predictive value is the likelihood that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease. The negative predictive value is the proportion of persons with a negative test result who are disease free; that is, the likelihood that a person who has a negative test result does not have the disease. Predictive values are influenced by disease prevalence: Positive predictive value increases as disease prevalence increases, and negative predictive value decreases (",
