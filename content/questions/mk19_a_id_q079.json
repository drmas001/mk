"), including possible bone involvement. Radiography is recommended for all patients with diabetes with new foot infections to assess for soft tissue gas, foreign body, and bony involvement. However, bony abnormalities may not appear for 2 or more weeks after onset of infection. Although no bone is visible in the ulcer base, and the metal probe-to-bone test is negative (positive predictive value of nearly 90% for osteomyelitis), the latter only has a negative predictive value of about 60%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 70 mm/h and ulcers larger than 2 × 2 cm are associated with an increased likelihood of osteomyelitis. This patient also has a leukocytosis, although up to two thirds of patients with osteomyelitis may have a normal leukocyte count. In patients with highly suspected osteomyelitis and a normal radiograph, MRI with and without intravenous contrast is the most accurate imaging study for evaluating diabetic foot osteomyelitis. In addition, it can better delineate the soft tissue involvement, including evidence of necrosis, abscess, and sinus tracts, allowing for better decision making regarding potential surgical intervention."
