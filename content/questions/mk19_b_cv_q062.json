Cardiac examination reveals a summation gallop and a grade 3/6 diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. Pulmonary examination reveals crackles. Radial pulses are weakly present on the right and absent on the left. Lower extremity pulses are diminished. Skin is cool and mottled."

In this patient with hypotension, asymmetric arm blood pressures and pulses, and murmur of aortic regurgitation, emergency repair of the aorta and aortic valve repair or replacement are indicated. Delaying surgical repair has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates, and expert consensus guidelines recommend emergency repair in patients without clear contraindications."

In-hospital mortality rates were no different in those who underwent coronary angiography compared with those who did not. Furthermore, coronary angiography had no impact on coronary artery bypass grafting, as most of these procedures were performed for coronary artery dissection, not atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. These findings support the need to perform aortic surgery as soon as possible and not delay surgery for coronary angiography."

"Although most guidelines recommend that patients with acute aortic dissection be treated aggressively with blood pressure reduction (systolic blood pressure goal of <120 mm Hg in the first hour), this patient should undergo emergent aortic repair due to evidence of cardiogenic shock. Interventions to reduce his blood pressure are not needed. When indicated, intravenous β-blocker therapy is used initially to lower blood pressure; decrease the velocity of left ventricular contraction; and reduce heart rate, contractility, and aortic shear stress. Vasodilator therapy, using agents such as nitroprusside (",
