"). This patient has acute bronchitis, which is a self-limited inflammation of the bronchi due to upper airway infection, typically caused by a viral pathogen. Classic symptoms include cough that lasts from 2 to 3 weeks, mild dyspnea, and sputum production. Findings on examination can include wheezing or rhonchi that are extinguished after coughing. Bronchitis is treated with supportive care. Several studies have shown an absence of benefit and possible harms in treating bronchitis with antibiotics. The presence of purulent sputum cannot be considered indicative of a bacterial etiology or a favorable response to treatment in acute bronchitis. Similarly, the duration of this patient's cough (9 days) does not confirm a bacterial cause, as the typical duration of cough in viral bronchitis is 2 to 3 weeks. This contrasts with the approach in acute rhinosinusitis, in which lack of improvement after 10 days and the presence of purulent nasal discharge suggest a bacterial etiology."
