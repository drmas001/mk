") from the current illness. In general, thyroid function should not be assessed in hospitalized patients unless clinical suspicion of thyroid dysfunction is high. This critically ill patient has abnormal thyroid function tests because of nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). NTIS commonly occurs in patients who are hospitalized and critically ill. Up to 75% of hospitalized patients have thyroid function test abnormalities. Nonthyroidal illness suppresses thyrotropin-releasing hormone, which typically results in suppressed but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. An undetectable TSH is inconsistent with NTIS. Infrequently, TSH can be mildly elevated in NTIS, but a TSH level of 20 μU/mL (20 mU/L) or greater is inconsistent with NTIS. Free thyroxine (T",
