"). SCLE appears as one of two variants: annular and polycyclic photosensitive plaques on the back, chest, and extremities, or psoriasiform scaly plaques in a similar distribution. SCLE does not scar but may resolve with temporary pigmentary changes. Fewer than one in four patients with SCLE has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and as many as one in three SCLE cases are drug induced. The latter may resolve with withdrawal of the causative agent. Up to 70% of patients with SCLE have an elevated antinuclear antibody titer, with anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB being overrepresented."

Essentially all patients with ACLE have SLE and as such tend to have systemic symptoms and positive serologic results. The rash of ACLE does not scar."

The centers of the lesions eventually become atrophic and depigmented, causing permanent alopecia if occurring in hair-bearing areas. Plaques favor the head and neck, particularly the scalp and the hollow of the auricle of the ear. CCLE in general has a low association with SLE, and DLE poses approximately a 10% risk for underlying systemic disease."
