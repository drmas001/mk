"). Neurally mediated syncope, or reflex syncope, is the most common form and is seen primarily in younger adults. The underlying syncopal mechanism, termed the neurocardiogenic or vasodepressor reflex, is a response of vasodilation, bradycardia, and systemic hypotension, which leads to transient hypoperfusion of the brain. Neurally mediated syncope includes vasovagal syncope, which is provoked by noxious stimuli, fear, stress, heat overexposure, or prolonged standing; situational syncope, which is triggered by cough, micturition, defecation, or deglutition; and carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is sometimes experienced during head rotation, shaving, or use of a tight-fitting neck collar. Prodromal symptoms, including nausea and diaphoresis, are classically present before neurally mediated syncope, and fatigue and generalized weakness are typically present afterward. Treatment of most types of situational syncope relies heavily on avoidance or elimination of a triggering event."

") is the second most common form of syncope and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality (including sudden death), and direct traumatic injury. Cardiovascular syncopal events often occur suddenly and usually without a significant prodrome, although chest pain and palpitations may be present briefly. Causes of cardiovascular syncope include arrhythmia; coronary artery disease; and structural and obstructive disease, including aortic and pulmonary valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade, and pulmonary embolism. This patient's prodrome of diaphoresis while straining during urination is most compatible with situational syncope."
