"). This patient has a gallbladder polyp. Incidental findings, including gallbladder polyps, are usually seen on 1% to 5% of gallbladder ultrasounds, as well as in resected gallbladders. Neoplastic adenomas are rare, representing less than 0.5% of polyps. The best predictor of a malignant or premalignant lesion is size; polyps greater than 1 cm are more likely to be neoplastic and should be treated with cholecystectomy if possible. Gallbladder polyps associated with gallbladder stones or primary sclerosing cholangitis are also more likely to be neoplastic. This patient has a polyp larger than 1 cm and therefore should be offered cholecystectomy."

") for patients with cholelithiasis and therefore a high likelihood of choledocholithiasis, and (2) magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for diagnostic evaluation if ultrasonography findings are indeterminate.

This patient does not have a dilated common bile duct or ascending cholangitis, and ERCP would not be appropriate."
