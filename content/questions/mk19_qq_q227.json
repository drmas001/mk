Typical behavioral changes in the earlier stages of Alzheimer disease include irritability, anxiety, and depression. Although visual hallucinations and motor symptoms may occur in Alzheimer disease, these features generally present relatively late in the disease course. In this patient, early cognitive fluctuations and parkinsonism favor dementia with Lewy bodies over Alzheimer disease."

In behavioral variant FTD, patients may exhibit hyperorality, loss of insight, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors, and impaired social conduct. In this patient, early impairment of memory and visuospatial function, psychosis, cognitive fluctuations, and motor symptoms are inconsistent with FTD."

") encompasses a category of disorders in which the causal link between cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment is strong. In older populations, vascular cognitive impairment is likely second only to Alzheimer disease as the most common primary cause of dementia (but not of neurodegenerative dementia). This disorder may occur concurrently with Alzheimer disease in older patients. The likelihood of vascular cognitive impairment increases with age and is associated with systemic vascular risk factors and a history of stroke (either clinically diagnosed or based on neuroimaging evidence). Two major signs of vascular cognitive impairment are early gait impairment and pseudobulbar affect (“emotional incontinence”) that can manifest as excessive crying or laughter disproportionate to the context of the situation and is abrupt in onset and discontinuation. Vascular cognitive impairment cannot explain this patient's parkinsonian motor features, visual hallucinations, blunted affect, and frequent fluctuations in attention."
