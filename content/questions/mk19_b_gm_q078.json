He thought he had finished a course of therapy."

") at this visit is important to promote medication adherence. This patient did not understand the need to continue his anticoagulant medication beyond the 14-day course he was provided. If patients do not comprehend medical instructions, as in the case of this patient, nonadherence with resultant adverse events, such as rehospitalization or mortality, may occur. Medication adherence is defined as the degree to which a patient adheres to the dosage and interval of their prescribed pharmacologic regimen. Nonadherence, typically defined as failure to take at least 80% of a prescribed medication regimen, has been associated with increased health care utilization, poor outcomes, and increased costs. Medication adherence is a complex behavior that is influenced by the patient, system, and provider. The factors most strongly associated with medication adherence include strong provider-patient relationships and a patient's understanding of their medical conditions."

") are recognized strategies to increase medication adherence. Both methods are usually acceptable to patients. Selecting a medication with the lowest copayment is challenging because it requires physicians to maintain knowledge of various and shifting copayments with a large number of insurance companies and is time intensive, and its impact is unknown. More important, it appears that the primary reason for this patient's nonadherence was lack of understanding of the prolonged treatment duration for deep venous thrombosis. Patient education is more likely to increase medication adherence than either a pill box or lowest copayment."

") may uncover health literacy problems but will not improve adherence to the required anticoagulation plan. Clinicians can address low health literacy by using techniques to improve patient understanding, such as repeating information and supplying the patient with educational materials written in plain language. The teach-back method, wherein the clinician asks patients to describe their understanding of instructions in their own words, is especially helpful in rapidly identifying a potential health literacy problem before a patient leaves a medical setting. The teach-back method coupled with education about the patient's medical problem and need for prolonged treatment is more likely to increase medication adherence than is screening for low health literacy alone."
