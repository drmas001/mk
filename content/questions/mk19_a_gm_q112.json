") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's constipation. The patient has developed opioid-induced constipation in the setting of opioid treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, and the constipation has probably worsened because of limited mobility due to the fractures. Most patients develop constipation with opioid use, and tolerance to this side effect typically does not improve over time, necessitating prophylactic and ongoing pharmacologic therapy. Many patients can be managed with an osmotic laxative, such as polyethylene glycol, but stimulant laxatives, such as senna, are often needed in addition to prevent constipation."

") is a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore can aid in the treatment of refractory opioid-induced constipation without reversing analgesia. Methylnaltrexone is often rapid acting, but it is contraindicated in patients with suspected bowel obstruction. The American Gastroenterological Association guideline for opioid-induced constipation provides a strong recommendation with at least moderate- to high-quality evidence for two peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists, naldemedine and naloxegol, for constipation refractory to first-line treatment with laxatives. Methylnaltrexone has a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. The best course of action for this patient is to proceed with a stimulant laxative and then reassess the need for advanced therapies."
