Although headache is the most common symptom after a mild TBI, persons with this diagnosis also may experience other symptoms, such as dizziness, memory or cognitive impairment, insomnia, and mood and anxiety disorders. The incidence of mild TBI in military service personnel is high. Falls, vehicular accidents, and head trauma from explosions and weaponry are common mechanisms of injury. Those with mild TBI sustained during active military duty appear to be particularly susceptible to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Given the high prevalence of depression and the increased risk for suicide in returning military personnel with mild TBI, screening for depression is mandatory. The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a validated and widely used depression screening tool for detection of depression. Its benefits include brevity and ease of use. Military personnel who screen positive for depression should be asked about suicidal ideation and intent. Screening for PTSD using tools such as the Primary Care PTSD Screen and the PTSD Checklist should also occur."

Corticospinal tract injury results in spastic paresis or paralysis, with weakness, hyperreflexia, muscle spasticity, and extensor plantar responses. There is often loss of sensation at or below the site of injury. This patient has signs of thoracic myelopathy on examination, with bilateral patellar hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at approximately T3 (below the nipple line). These examination findings suggest a thoracic cord localization, and thus the most specific test to order would be MRI of the thoracic spine. Determining the location and mechanism of injury is crucial for rapidly deciding on the accurate site, type of neuroimaging required, and the kind of specialty consultation (such as neurosurgical) needed."

Noncompressive myelopathy is possible in this patient and can be caused by many inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, vascular, and genetic disorders. Inflammatory causes are most common, including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and sarcoidosis. Finally, CT myelography is invasive and thus should not be used as first-line therapy."

Headaches, visual symptoms, and intracranial noises (pulsatile tinnitus) are the most common presenting symptoms of IIH. Head pain is nonspecific, and neck pain is common. Vision may be blurred or periodically dim in brief episodes known as visual obscurations. Findings on neurologic examination include papilledema and occasionally ophthalmoplegia, typically sixth nerve palsy. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI may reveal widening of the optic nerve sheaths, an empty sella, or flattening of the posterior optic globes. Magnetic resonance venography may reveal unilateral or bilateral stenoses of the intracranial transverse sinuses or may have normal results. Approximately 90% of persons with IIH are women of childbearing age with an elevated BMI. IIH has been associated with kidney failure, endocrine disorders, and the use of tetracyclines, retinoic acid, and progesterone or estrogen supplements. Discontinuation of any potential offending agent is the first step in management."

The most prevalent primary headache condition, tension-type headache is defined as a headache disorder that, unlike migraine, is mild to moderate in intensity and not associated with nausea or severe sensory or neurologic symptoms. Annual population prevalence in the United States is approximately 40% for episodic (<15 days monthly) tension-type headache and 2.5% for its chronic (15 or more days monthly) counterpart. Despite its high population prevalence, tension-type headache comprises only 3% of outpatient headache consultations, most likely because of its nondisabling nature. Pain is typically bilateral, nonpulsatile, and mild to moderate in intensity without aggravation by physical activity. Acetaminophen, aspirin, NSAIDs, and caffeine-containing compounds are typically effective acute treatments for tension-type headache, and many patients self-medicate successfully. Nonpharmacologic treatments have gained popularity as alternative interventions for tension-type headaches in recent years. Psychological treatment strategies, such as relaxation training and cognitive behavioral therapies, are evidence-based and should be considered for all patients with tension-type headache. Available options for prevention of tension-type headache are more limited. Amitriptyline is the only agent shown to be effective in controlled trials; venlafaxine and mirtazapine have more limited data."

The patient has had a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to a ruptured aneurysm in the posterior communicating artery that has now been occluded to prevent neurologic decline from aneurysmal rebleeding. Treatment of SAH focuses on prevention of early (≤48 hours) and late neurologic complications. Within the first 48 hours, a major cause of morbidity is aneurysmal rebleeding; early surgical exclusion of the ruptured aneurysm and blood pressure control are the foundations of early treatment. The target blood pressure for patients following SAH is not well defined, but guidelines suggest a systolic blood pressure of less than 160 mm Hg as reasonable. Late complications include elevated intracranial pressure from obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebral edema, seizures, and cerebral vasospasm. Cerebral vasospasm with resultant cerebral ischemia and neurologic worsening may develop beginning near day 5. Nimodipine should be started as early as possible once the patient is stabilized to improve neurologic outcomes. Nimodipine was thought to prevent cerebral artery vasospasm, but evidence for this effect is lacking. However, nimodipine does improve clinical outcomes in patients with SAH and is recommended in all patients as soon as possible following diagnosis."

On noncontrast images, meningiomas may be hypointense or isointense and thus not readily seen. The term benign is used with caution in neurology because a histologically benign tumor may still be neurologically morbid because of location and size. No acute treatment is necessary in this case because the patient does not have a history of worrisome focal neurologic symptoms, has a normal neurologic examination, and shows a clear and stable pattern of migraine headaches (throbbing headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea lasting 6 to 8 hours) that are unrelated to the tumor. Because the patient's throbbing headache can occur on either side of her head, and the tingling is on the incorrect side of the body in relationship to the meningioma, the meningioma is most likely an incidental finding in this patient."

MRI is one of the most sensitive diagnostic tools for CJD, typically showing a pattern of increased intensity in the diffusion-weighted sequence in the basal ganglia and various cortical regions. CJD is a prion-related disorder that often presents with rapidly progressive dementia. The cause of CJD is an abnormally folded prion protein, which occurs by a spontaneous mutation (85%), is acquired by exposure to a transmissible protein, or is an inherited genetic mutation. Prion diseases have no known therapy. Time from disease onset to death is approximately 12 months in as many as 80% of patients with CJD. The rapid cognitive decline seen with this disorder is associated with myoclonus, gait problems, visual compromise, and interruption of the circadian rhythm. The real-time quaking-induced conversion assay is the most sensitive and specific test for prion proteins in the CSF. It uses recombinant prion protein and thioflavin T, a fluorescent dye, to detect prion protein present in the CSF despite its being present in only small quantities. The prion protein in the CSF induces the recombinant prion protein to change shape and form fibrils that bind thioflavin T and begin to fluoresce. The quantity of fluorescence is measured in real time."

Use of triptans, ergot alkaloids, opioids, or combination analgesics for 10 or more days per month or simple analgesics for 15 or more days per month constitutes medication overuse. Affected patients often report daily or near-daily headache that is refractory to numerous treatments. MOH is more common in midlife, in women, and in persons with high baseline headache frequency. The development of MOH often coincides with the transformation of episodic forms of migraine or tension-type headache (occurring <15 days per month) into their chronic subtypes (15 or more days monthly). Treatment of MOH is to wean overused acute medications, initiate migraine preventive medication, and provide new acute medications limited in use to 10 or fewer days per month."

This patients meets the clinical criteria for convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), defined as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting greater than 5 minutes, or two generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring within 5 minutes of each other and without a return to baseline mental status. CSE is a medical emergency. Empiric therapy is indicated without awaiting results of electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, serum studies, or lumbar puncture because a longer duration of CSE is strongly linked to worse outcomes. Securing the airway and obtaining intravenous access are the first steps in CSE management. If point-of-care glucose testing is not available, thiamine should be given, followed by intravenous glucose. This patient has failed first-line therapy of intravenous lorazepam. Intravenous fosphenytoin is indicated for second-line therapy. Fosphenytoin can cause acute bradycardia and hypotension. Intravenous valproic acid or levetiracetam are reasonable alternatives, provided that he is not already taking maximum doses of levetiracetam at home. Fosphenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam have similar efficacy as second-line agents."

Primary amyloidosis is associated with monoclonal proteins, whereas familial amyloidosis is secondary to transthyretin gene mutation. When low ECG voltage accompanies increased myocardial wall thickness on echocardiogram, amyloidosis should be considered. Bilateral involvement of carpal tunnel syndrome and, particularly, recurrence of related symptoms after decompression surgery is suggestive of amyloid neuropathy. Other common symptoms include sluggish pupils, hypohidrosis, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and urinary and erectile dysfunction. Although hereditary amyloidosis is more common in African Americans, it should be considered in all patients and regardless of family history. Amyloidosis is diagnosed by tissue biopsy and familial amyloidosis by additional testing with transthyretin gene sequencing. The recently approved drugs inotersen and patisiran have slowed the progression of hereditary amyloid neuropathy and improved quality of life."

" For any patient with a first seizure, obtaining a detailed history is crucial to distinguish seizures from other causes of symptoms. Making the distinction between seizure and nonseizure events and first-time versus recurrent episodes is key in selecting the proper management. The patient likely had a first (new-onset) seizure, and neuroimaging is indicated for all adult patients with a first-time seizure. CT of the head is adequate initially to rapidly exclude emergent pathology, including hemorrhage, but MRI is required and preferred in most patients. Because temporal lobe epilepsy is common, MRI sequences focusing on the hippocampus and temporal lobes are useful. Outpatient electroencephalography (EEG) also is recommended in patients with a first seizure (and has already been scheduled in this case). A single routine EEG is only 40% to 50% sensitive in the diagnosis of seizure, but the yield can increase to 80% to 90% with repeated studies, prolonged studies, and studies that capture sleep."

"). Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders caused by dysfunction of the mitochondria and may present as myopathies, neuropathies, and multisystemic diseases with maternal inheritance. Maternal inheritance is a unique and distinctive feature of mitochondrial DNA. Offspring of affected fathers do not inherit these diseases, but all offspring regardless of sex are at equal risk for inheriting the disease when a mother possesses the mutation. Each cell carries multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome and deleterious mutations usually affect some but not all copies of the mitochondrial genome. The expression of disease due to mitochondrial DNA depends on the relative proportions of normal and abnormal mitochondrial DNA. This means that there can be substantial variation in the likelihood of developing the disease and the disease severity. In this case, three of the offspring are affected because of this variable expression of disease. Mitochondrial disorders can present with a wide range of fluctuating symptoms, including weakness, autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal motility disorders, chronic pain, vision and hearing disorders, and cardiovascular disease. In this patient, fluctuating weakness, ophthalmoplegia, multiorgan symptoms, and family history should prompt consideration of mitochondrial myopathy."

The feet can appear as though they are stuck to the ground, which is described as a “magnetic” gait. In addition, this patient's MRI of the brain shows communicating (nonobstructive) hydrocephalus. NPH is treated by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed by a neurosurgeon. Before treatment is attempted, a test that predicts response to shunting is necessary. This test assesses the patient's gait after removal of 30 to 50 mL of CSF. The patient's walking is timed immediately before and after lumbar puncture. An objective measure of gait improvement is the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), which measures the amount of time necessary to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn, return to the chair, and sit. An improvement in time by more than 5 seconds is predictive of a positive response to CSF shunting."

Altered brain function is most commonly described by affected subjects as being confused or dazed, with 10% reporting transient loss of consciousness. Next to accidents, sporting activities represent the second most common source of TBI in young adults. In men, football and hockey result in most cases of mild TBI, whereas in women, the most common cause is soccer. When TBI is suspected, athletes must be immediately removed from play and subjected to standardized sideline assessment tools. Guidelines recommend continued avoidance of contact sports until 10 days after the trauma or until the patient has been asymptomatic while taking no medication for a period of 7 days.

Prolonged hypotension during cardiovascular or aortic surgery can result in lack of perfusion to watershed regions of the spinal cord. In this patient, the infarction likely occurred as a consequence of hypoperfusion to the spinal cord vasculature in the anterior arterial vascular distribution in the setting of repair of an aortic dissection. The midportion of the thoracic spinal cord is especially prone to hypoperfusion infarction where the anterior spinal artery from above meets the radicular artery of Adamkiewicz from below. Hypoperfusion in the anterior arterial vascular distribution of the cord typically interrupts both descending motor pathways and the anterior horn cells in the gray matter of the cord, resulting in acute, bilateral, flaccid (low tone, hyporeflexia) paralysis. If sensation is impaired, it will not involve the posterior columns (vibration, position) because of separate vascular supply to the posterior cord."

"). With the growth of the aging population, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia is increasing. However, the incidence of dementia is declining with the control of vascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). Adjustments to diet will mitigate many of the risk factors for developing cognitive decline. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, fish and whole-grain cereal products are being studied and show some promise for increasing brain health. However, these benefits have not been confirmed. Exercise is the most important modifiable lifestyle factor to prevent the onset of cognitive impairment. Results from systematic reviews suggest that exercise training is associated with moderate positive effects for global cognition, logical memory, inhibitory control, and divided attention. Even exercise that is initiated in mid to late life can still provide benefits. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults perform at least 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. Other options include 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or equivalent combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise."

Approximately 10% of patients with MS have experienced persistent thoughts of suicide. Furthermore, the suicide rate for patients with MS and depression is elevated compared with that of patients with depression only. MS-related depression is likely multifactorial, involving the emotional response to dealing with a chronic disease, the consequence of demyelinating lesions and inflammatory cytokines on neurotransmitter function, and the adverse effects of treatments (such as interferon beta). Clinicians should be vigilant for the signs of depression, and if present, screen for suicidality. If suicidal ideation is present, the lethality of the ideation should be evaluated. Clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating antidepressants and offering referrals to psychiatry or psychology for counseling.

Physical and occupational therapy can provide gait safety training and improve balance and endurance. Assistive devices, such as braces, canes, walkers, and electrostimulatory walk-assist devices, can provide additional benefit. This patient's left leg findings are consistent with injury to the corticospinal tract from a prior relapse. Dalfampridine, an oral voltage-gated potassium channel antagonist, can improve gait speed and endurance in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) with ambulatory dysfunction. Dalfampridine cannot induce healing or remyelination. However, this medication likely improves neuronal conduction, allowing signals to be processed through the corticospinal tract more efficiently and thus leading to improvements in gait in those with injury to this tract. Dalfampridine has a rare risk of seizures and should not be used in patients with known epilepsy or with kidney impairment."

Withdrawal of alcohol and drugs such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and antidepressants can also precipitate delirium. Antidepressant medications should be gradually tapered to avoid discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation symptoms can occur with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor but is most commonly reported with paroxetine. The most common symptoms are dizziness, fatigue, and headache.

The pain is unilateral and severe and orbital, supraorbital, or temporal in location. Associated features must include at least one ipsilateral cranial autonomic feature (lacrimation, nasal stuffiness or rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection, ptosis, miosis) and/or a sense of restlessness or agitation. Cluster headache has a cyclical nature in which periods of recurrent headache activity are interrupted by months to years of headache remission. Many of the attacks are nocturnal, and some may be provoked by alcohol ingestion. When cluster headache (or any TAC) is suspected, brain MRI is necessary to rule out structural mimics. Subcutaneous sumatriptan and 100% oxygen inhalation are both effective for cluster headache and indicated as first-line treatments of attacks."

This patient's history of lightheadedness on standing and substantial drop in standing blood pressure suggests orthostatic hypotension as the likely cause of his fall. Examination reveals no freezing of gait or postural impairment, findings that are often noted in more advanced Parkinson disease. Orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson disease can be due to disease-related autonomic dysfunction, comorbidities (such as diabetic autonomic neuropathy), or a peripheral effect of levodopa. Symptom onset after initiation of levodopa therapy should alert clinicians to this potential drug-related adverse effect. Carbidopa blocks the adverse effects of levodopa outside the brain and is always administered in combination with levodopa. However, in patients with severe peripheral side effects of levodopa, such as orthostatic hypotension, higher carbidopa doses can alleviate these symptoms."

Characteristic clinical findings of myoclonus are brief, “shock-like” involuntary movements caused by muscular contractions (positive myoclonus) or inhibitions (negative myoclonus, [e.g., asterixis]). Positive myoclonus is the defining seizure manifestation of myoclonic seizures. When describing symptoms, patients will usually use words like “twitches”, “spasms,” “jerks,” or even “shakes.” Patients are often described as “clumsy” before establishing the diagnosis of myoclonic seizure, since suddenly dropping items is a common symptom. Myoclonic seizures are considered generalized seizures, which involve the entire body. They may occur more often on awakening, and recording an electroencephalogram (EEG) after a period of sleep may help capture evidence of the seizure for diagnostic confirmation. Myoclonus should not be confused with myoclonic seizures; myoclonus is a single muscle group twitch that may be focal or generalized, but which may or may not represent a seizure. For example, benign myoclonus of sleep, the so-called hypnic jerks commonly experienced when falling asleep, are normal; unlike with a myoclonic seizure, the EEG pattern would be normal during the myoclonic event."

In this patient, the finding of muscle mounding after percussion (myoedema) strongly suggests hypothyroidism. The diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism is made by measuring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level and, if elevated, measuring the level of serum free thyroxine (T",

"). Clinical symptoms and signs can be nonspecific, often resulting in a delayed diagnosis. If asked, most patients do have muscular symptoms (stiffness, myalgias, cramps, easy fatigability), and muscle symptoms may be the predominant or the only clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism. If measured, serum creatine kinase is elevated in many patients with hypothyroidism, but the degree of elevation does not always correlate with the severity of muscle symptoms. Other features that may be seen with hypothyroid myopathy include goiter, ptosis, enlarged muscle bulk, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes (Woltman sign)."

Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is a more severely symptomatic form of myopathy with CK levels typically greater than 40 times the ULN. Most patients experience statin-induced myopathy within the first year of therapy after a dose increase or the addition of an interacting drug. Most drugs that interact with statins increase the statin blood concentration and the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. The typical clinical presentation consists of symmetric muscle pain and weakness, but nonspecific lower back pain has been reported as a feature of statin-induced myopathy. The serum CK level should be measured in patients taking a statin who develop muscle pain or weakness. Delay in making the diagnosis (and stopping the statin) can lead to rhabdomyolysis and possibly acute kidney injury. Discontinuation of the statin most commonly results in a rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of the serum CK level."

Patients with primary and malignant brain tumors, as with most patients with cancer, are hypercoagulable and predisposed to VTE. The perioperative risk associated with glioma approaches 25% in some studies and prophylaxis should begin on admission to the hospital. Guidelines recommend pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis over mechanical prophylaxis in acutely or critically ill patients. In situations in which pharmacologic prophylaxis cannot be given, such as immediately prior to or following neurosurgery, guidelines recommend mechanical prophylaxis over no prophylaxis. Mechanical prophylaxis choices for patients undergoing cranial surgery include either intermittent pneumatic compression or graduated compression stockings. However, not all guidelines support the use of compression stockings for VTE prophylaxis. The differing recommendations relate to the quality of evidence and values assigned to benefits and harms. Recent guidelines recommend continuation of mechanical prophylaxis following cranial surgery for 30 days or until the patient is mobile or discharged, whichever is sooner. The addition of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) starting 24 to 48 hours after cranial surgery and continued for 7 days after surgery is also suggested for patients whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding."

Aneurysms that are less than 7 mm in the posterior circulation (posterior communicating and basilar arteries) have a similarly low risk for rupture. Factors associated with increased risk for rupture include rapid growth detected over serial imaging, active tobacco use, and uncontrolled hypertension. Other predictors of aneurysmal rupture that should prompt surgical consideration include a previous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, rapid aneurysm growth, or the presence of cranial nerve palsy. Annual noninvasive imaging is recommended in patients with an unruptured aneurysm. CT or MRI angiography can be considered for serial imaging because they are both noninvasive, with CT usually performed in patients who cannot undergo MRI. Additional noninvasive testing on a yearly basis should be performed to track aneurysm growth, which may be a predictor for rupture."

"). One tool used to categorize dementia into levels of severity is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Mild dementia is often associated with a MMSE score of 20 to 23, moderate dementia a score of 10 to 19, and severe dementia a score <10. This patient is in a mild stage of dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD), given her abnormal test score and her functional dependence with her finances. AD is the most common memory-predominant dementia and is also the most common cause of dementia. The typical presentation of AD is that of an insidious worsening of memory, language, and visuospatial abilities. Manifestations include forgetfulness, frequent repetition of questions or statements, word-finding difficulties, hesitation in speech, and navigational problems. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are approved for treating mild-to-moderate dementia in patients with AD and have demonstrated modest benefits in cognitive performance, stabilizing progression of symptoms, and functional loss. Because of their possible adverse effects on conduction, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be used with caution or avoided in patients with bradycardia or other conduction abnormalities. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal issues, which result in discontinuation of the medication in nearly 20% of patients. Additional adverse effects include syncope, agitation, nocturnal cramps, and vivid dreams. Donepezil should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures."

"). This elderly patient likely has a lamotrigine-related rash. Lamotrigine may cause a morbiliform rash, which most commonly resolves with discontinuation of the drug but sometimes may be severe and life-threatening. This patient's rash is likely not a serious rash based on the lack of mucosal involvement, lymphadenopathy, and systemic features, including fever. Reassuring laboratory findings include the absence of eosinophilia and normal aminotransaminase levels. Morbilliform reactions are the most common drug reactions and are most likely a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. As such, the rash appears in the first or second week after drug exposure. Patients develop pink papules and macules that coalesce symmetrically to form plaques. The papules are often dense and monomorphic and are accompanied by varying degrees of pruritus beginning on the trunk and progressing distally across the limbs. Palms and soles are usually spared. Treatment involves cessation of the causative agent, systemic and/or topical glucocorticoids, and oral H1 antihistamines. Any patient taking an antiepileptic drug should be counseled to stop their medication and to contact their clinician if a rash develops, and seek emergency care if fevers, skin pain, blisters, pustules, or mucous membrane involvement is present, indicating serious and potentially life-threating conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. Gabapentin has a low incidence of rash and other allergic reactions and also has good evidence of efficacy in focal epilepsy in older adults; thus, it is the most appropriate replacement for lamotrigine."

Thunderclap headache is defined as a severe attack of headache pain developing abruptly and reaching maximum intensity within 1 minute. Although occasionally of primary origin, thunderclap headache is a medical emergency that warrants immediate diagnostic evaluation. Thunderclap headache has a broad differential diagnosis; the most serious is aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A small proportion (less than 5%) of patients with aneurysmal SAH will have a CT scan of the head that is negative for bleeding and require a lumbar puncture to rule out this condition. In patients with SAH, results on lumbar puncture performed 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset will reveal elevated erythrocyte counts and xanthochromia (yellow color caused by breakdown of red blood cells). If lumbar puncture is performed within 12 hours of symptom onset, it may be challenging to distinguish a traumatic process from the acute presence of erythrocytes from aneurysmal bleeding because xanthochromia may not yet have developed."

Lung, breast, and prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma are the most common types of cancer that cause ESCC in adults. Emergent use of high-dose glucocorticoids is the first step. Systematic reviews of the evidence suggest that surgical decompression followed by radiotherapy is most beneficial for patients younger than 65 years who have a single area of compression, paraplegia with a duration of less than 48 hours, and a predicted survival of greater than 6 months. In patients not meeting these criteria, such as this patient, surgical intervention may be of little benefit, and radiotherapy alone may be used.

American Academy of Neurology guidelines recommend discontinuation of all disease-modifying therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS who have been nonambulatory for more than 2 years and who have had no relapsing activity during that same period. This patient has been nonambulatory for more than 2 years, has no evidence of MS activity within the past 2 years on a recent MRI, and has not had any relapses for 6 years. This recommendation is based on data from clinical trials in patients with progressive forms of MS that show a lack of benefit from disease-modifying drugs in patients of any age with high degrees of disability and no relapsing activity. Additionally, patients older than 65 years are more prone to infectious complications from disease-modifying therapy, which results in a risk-to-benefit ratio that does not favor treatment."

Once initiated, the migraine attack may possess not only the phases of aura and headache, but also of prodrome and postdrome. Prodromal or premonitory symptoms may precede these other phases by hours or sometimes days and, given that timing, they occasionally may be confused for a triggering influence. After severe attacks, postdrome is quite common and often described as a “headache hangover.” Evidence-based guidelines recommend several simple and combination analgesic agents as first-line therapies for acute migraine. Aspirin administered alone or in combination with acetaminophen and caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and dissolvable diclofenac potassium are all supported by strong evidence. Triptans are migraine-specific selective agonists at 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B and 1D receptors with direct impact on trigeminovascular activation associated with migraine attacks. Guidelines recommend the use of triptans (such as zolmitriptan) in patients with moderate to severe migraine who have not responded to NSAID therapy over a series of at least three migraine attacks. Current evidence suggests that all oral triptans possess nearly similar clinical efficacy."

When dementia occurs well after the motor symptoms, it is considered Parkinson disease dementia.

"). Suicide in patients with epilepsy is estimated to be three times higher than in patients without epilepsy. This risk remains elevated in patients with or without known psychiatric disease, although psychiatric conditions are underdiagnosed in patients with epilepsy. Although antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been associated with increased risk of suicidality, the increased risk cannot be explained by medication use alone. Other identified risk factors for suicide among patients with epilepsy include male gender and high seizure frequency. Many antiepileptic drugs have mood-altering properties. Changes in therapy or dosages may result in unintended behavioral or psychiatric consequences. Examples include the discontinuation of AEDs with mood-stabilizing effects (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, valproic acid) or introduction of AEDs with adverse psychiatric manifestations (topiramate, gabapentin, levetiracetam). All AEDs carry a warning about worsening depression and suicidality, and all patients must be screened and monitored for these symptoms. For such screening, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 is effective and easy to use. If a patient provides a positive response to either of the two questions (“Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?” and “Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?”), further investigation for depression is warranted. Although all seizure medications carry a warning about suicidal ideation, it is important to identify the agents with the highest risk. Levetiracetam carries a higher incidence of causing or worsening depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation than other seizure medications. A recent retrospective review of AED use and side effects for 4085 adult patients started on a new AED regimen found that psychiatric and behavioral side effects occur significantly more frequently in patients taking levetiracetam and zonisamide than any other AED. On the other hand, carbamazepine, clobazam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid were significantly associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric and behavioral side effects. Therefore, levetiracetam is the drug that should be discontinued in this patient."

") is the most appropriate additional diagnostic test. The patient's sleeplessness and agitation suggest that he has developed a hyperactive delirium. His age and dementia diagnosis place him at increased risk for delirium; preexisting cognitive impairment is the major predisposing factor for delirium. The evaluation of delirium can be very difficult in patients who cannot provide a helpful history to focus the evaluation. A single cause of delirium is unusual, found in only about one-third of hospitalized patients; a mean of three causes of delirium is found in the balance of patients. The leading causes of delirium are fluid and electrolyte disturbances, infection (most commonly urinary tract and pneumonia), metabolic disturbances, sensory/environmental disturbances, and drug toxicity. The top three classes of drugs most commonly implicated in precipitating delirium are opioids, benzodiazepines, and drugs with anticholinergic properties. Intracerebral processes are uncommon causes of acute onset delirium and are usually clinically apparent. Based on these findings, a practical strategy can be developed for the evaluation of delirium in the absence of suggestive symptoms or findings. A careful review of medications should be the first step. Serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels may detect hyponatremia and suggest deficits in intravascular volume not detected on physical examination. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment in older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In this patient who cannot give a symptom history, a urinalysis seems a reasonable initial management step. If the cause remains obscure, it is reasonable to consider chest radiography."

Patients treated with methylprednisolone have a significant reduction in the risk of either worsening or not improving within 5 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. Oral equivalency studies have shown that oral methylprednisolone (1 g/d) or prednisone (1250 mg/d) may act as viable alternatives to this regimen. Frequent or prolonged glucocorticoid treatment should be avoided to minimize the risks of osteopenia and early cataracts. Any patient with a suspected relapse should be screened for causes of Uhthoff phenomenon masquerading as a relapse (or “pseudorelapse”) to avoid unnecessary treatment. The Uhthoff phenomenon describes a transient worsening of baseline neurologic symptoms in the setting of hot weather, physical exertion, or fever."

Although most patients with insomnia do not benefit from diagnostic testing, signs or symptoms suggesting an associated medical condition, such as depression, anxiety, or sleep apnea, should be evaluated. This patient has symptoms of restless leg syndrome (RLS). RLS is a common movement disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs. Patients report an uncomfortable sensation that is worse at rest and at night and is transiently relieved by movement. RLS can interfere with falling or staying asleep and may be associated with periodic limb movements of sleep. Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are brief triple flexion movements of the legs that repeat in 20-second cycles during sleep. This disorder is very common and can occur independently of or be associated with RLS, sleep-disordered breathing, or narcolepsy. The diagnosis of PLMS is made by using polysomnography. Treatment of PLMS is required only if it causes marked sleep fragmentation. Patients with RLS should be screened for iron deficiency because iron supplementation in the presence of low-normal serum ferritin levels may resolve the symptoms."

Epilepsy may not be diagnosed until the first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) occurs because myoclonic seizures often remain unrecognized. The presence of myoclonic seizures is required for the diagnosis of JME; patients may report dropping items from their hands, commonly a coffee cup or hairbrush, because myoclonic seizures in JME generally occur in the morning. Most affected patients have GTCSs, and approximately 30% of patients have absence seizures. Seizures are often controlled with one or two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Lifelong AED therapy is typically required. Because she is planning a pregnancy, lamotrigine and levetiracetam are the preferred treatment options and are considered among the safest seizure medications from a teratogenicity standpoint and for general, long-term safety.

Onset is often preceded by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, triggering a T-cell–mediated autoimmune attack against peripheral nerve and root myelin. A very few patients develop Guillain-Barré syndrome after immunization, surgery, or trauma. The weakness may occur first in the proximal muscles. Paresthesia and early low back pain are common. Dysautonomia can be severe and predispose patients to labile blood pressure and arrhythmias. Progressive respiratory and bulbar weakness may lead to rapid respiratory failure. Both plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are equally effective and appropriate options in this setting. The combination of plasma exchange and immunoglobulin therapy is no more effective than treatment with either modality alone. Although albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein level with a normal or mildly elevated leukocyte count) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy on electromyography are characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome, these findings may be absent early in the course of disease; the tests may need to be repeated later if diagnostic uncertainty persists. However, treatment should not be delayed for confirmatory testing. In this patient with characteristic symptoms and normal findings on spinal imaging and CSF cell count, the most likely diagnosis is Guillain-Barré syndrome and treatment should be initiated."

Major risk factors for seizure recurrence include stroke and dementia, but about one-third to one-half of cases are of unknown cause. The diagnosis of seizures in older adults may be difficult because of atypical presentations that may mimic delirium, transient ischemic attack, or syncope. Possible seizures should always be included in the differential diagnosis of older patients with intermittent or fluctuating confusional states of unclear etiology. Antiepileptic drug therapy should be started in older adults following two clearly documented unprovoked seizures (e.g., seizures not related to alcohol metabolic derangements, medication, or medication withdrawal). The dosing strategy can be summarized as “start low and go slow” because older adults usually require lower antiepileptic drug doses and are at increased risk of interactions and decreased drug clearance. Multiple studies suggest lamotrigine, gabapentin, and levetiracetam are better-tolerated and equally effective seizure medications when compared with older antiepileptic drugs in treatment of older adults."

"). The patient has migraine without aura. Migraine is a chronic neurobiologic disorder characterized by attacks of head pain and various associated features. Attacks are often separated by periods of normal brain function. Even at times of symptom freedom, patients possess an underlying predisposition for migraine episodes possibly because of a biologically based inherent hypersensitivity of the central nervous system. Exposure to certain internal and external factors may trigger a migraine attack in migraine-prone individuals while leaving those without such a predisposition unaffected. Patient surveys indicate stress or a poststress period (let-down effect) as the most common triggering factor. Changes in female hormones, sleep or meal pattern disruptions, weather factors, and strong sensory light, sound, or odor stimuli are also frequently reported as triggers. The goal of migraine prevention is the reduction of migraine frequency, intensity, and duration. The best agents may reduce migraine frequency by half in approximately half of the patients treated. Pharmacologic prophylaxis should be considered when the headache frequency reaches 5 days per month and almost always is initiated when the frequency exceeds 10 days per month. Venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is among the agents with Level A or Level B evidence of effectiveness in episodic migraine prevention. Propranolol, timolol, metoprolol, amitriptyline, topiramate, sodium valproate, erenumab, fremanezumab, eptinezumab, and galcanezumab are also considered beneficial in this setting."

"). Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Based on the symptoms described, this patient most likely has focal impaired awareness seizures (formerly known as focal dyscognitive seizures or complex partial seizures) of temporal lobe origin. She has drug-resistant epilepsy, having ongoing seizures despite treatment with two tolerated, appropriately chosen, and adequately dosed antiepileptic medications (whether as monotherapy or in combination). The patient should be referred to an epilepsy center for video EEG monitoring to confirm the diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy and evaluate her for epilepsy surgery. Mesial temporal sclerosis with hippocampal atrophy is the most common cause of drug-resistant adult-onset focal epilepsy. Therefore, brain MRI is also an appropriate next step because surgical candidacy requires confirmation that seizure manifestations on video EEG match the location of pathology on MRI or other advanced functional imaging (single-photon emission CT or PET). These steps are required to determine if the patient can be considered for temporal lobectomy."

This patient should undergo MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium and with attention to the brainstem and internal auditory canal. Bell palsy is an acute-onset (usually over a period of hours) peripheral mononeuropathy involving the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) that leads to weakness in the muscles of facial expression in both the upper and lower face, hyperacusis, and impaired taste. In classic Bell palsy, initial brain imaging and laboratory testing are not required. However, muscles of mastication are innervated by the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and ocular abduction (ability to bury the sclera on lateral gaze) is innervated by the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). Presence of these findings and a subacute progressive course over 10 days are red flags that should prompt further workup, including brain imaging. In addition, serologic testing for causes of multiple cranial neuropathies and, if needed, cerebrospinal fluid analysis with cytology should also be considered."

The three most common atraumatic spinal emergencies are spinal epidural abscess, cauda equina syndrome, and spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma. Specific signs and symptoms can provide clues as to the cause of compression. The presence of fever and focal back pain and tenderness, especially in patients who have had recent back instrumentation or have a history of intravenous drug use, may indicate an epidural abscess. A history of cancer and focal back pain should raise concern for metastatic disease or pathologic vertebral fracture. Anticoagulant use raises the risk of compression from an epidural hematoma, particularly in the setting of recent back instrumentation or excessive anticoagulation. Spinal epidural abscess most commonly results from hematogenous dissemination, with ",

") are also implicated. Predisposing factors for bacteremia include endocarditis, injection drug use, long-term intravenous catheters (hemodialysis catheters, central lines), diabetes, and urinary tract infection. Spinal epidural abscess can also occur after neurosurgical procedures (spinal fusion, epidural catheter placement) or paraspinal injection. Patients usually develop localized pain at the site of infection that later radiates down the spine or into the legs. Blood cultures should be obtained before starting empiric antibiotics, but antibiotics should not be delayed by other diagnostic testing. MRI is the imaging modality of choice to identify location and extent of the abscess and is the preferred imaging modality for other causes of spine injury. The entire spine should be visualized because infection, bleeding, or metastatic cancer may be multifocal. Decompressive surgery followed by culture-directed long-term antibiotics is the treatment of choice for epidural abscess."

Of the four core features of this condition—parkinsonian motor features (particularly gait problems and slowness of movements), visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and frequent fluctuations in attention—this patient has three: parkinsonism, hallucinations, and attention fluctuations. The latter may manifest as acute confusional episodes in which the patient is less responsive than usual or as intermittent days with excessive daytime sleepiness. Additionally, this patient may also have REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out his dreams), but polysomnography is required to confirm this diagnosis. Clinical history and neurologic examination findings are critical for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies to avoid inappropriate treatment, particularly with antipsychotic drugs to which these patients are uniquely sensitive. Indicative biomarkers also have been developed to support the diagnosis when sufficient clinical history is lacking."

REM sleep behavior disorder is much more common in dementia with Lewy bodies than Alzheimer disease. Delusions and hallucinations are common in dementia with Lewy bodies and frequently occur at the mild stages of disease. Additionally, significant sleep problems, especially daytime sleepiness, can be a debilitating feature of dementia with Lewy bodies. The fluctuations in Alzheimer disease can be described as days when memory is better or worse, whereas in dementia with Lewy bodies, the bad days involve decreased alertness."

"). Migraine is the most common severe headache in both population-based and clinic-based studies. Annual prevalence for migraine approximates 13% of adults, and greater than 90% of headache visits to primary care and specialty settings involve migraine. According to criteria published in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, migraine involves recurrent attacks (at least 5 lifetime) of head pain lasting, without treatment, from 4 to 72 hours. The pain of migraine involves at least two of four features (unilateral location, throbbing nature, moderate to severe intensity, worsening with routine physical activity) and is associated with at least one of two features: (1) nausea and/or vomiting and (2) photophobia and phonophobia. Neurologic examination is typically normal. Migraine may be subclassified qualitatively (with or without aura) and quantitatively (episodic or chronic). Migraine in patients reporting visual or neurologic symptoms meeting appropriate criteria will be subclassified as migraine with aura, but very few patients with migraine will ever experience aura. The number of total headache days per month differentiates episodic (<15 days) from chronic (15 or more days) migraine. Because of the extensive phenotypic variation, nearly half of migraine presentations are misdiagnosed. Neck pain (75%) and “sinus” symptoms, such as tearing or nasal drainage (50%), are both more common than features felt to be characteristic of migraine, such as vomiting or aura."

Its onset is abrupt, with a spontaneous, rapid, and complete recovery. The most common cause of syncope is neurally mediated syncope, which generally occurs with prolonged standing or dehydration and has a prodrome of nausea, lightheadedness, warmth, tunnel vision, or palpitations. Stereotyped events with warning signs can be mistaken for seizures, but the duration of loss of consciousness is usually briefer in syncope (<1 min) than in seizures, and immediate and complete neurologic recovery is typical. Nonepileptic myoclonus (in this patient) and other types of movements and shaking are typical of convulsive syncope; in fact, syncope without any movements is the exception rather than the rule."

Hemifacial spasm is often caused by vascular compression of cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) at its exit zone from the brainstem.

Focal dystonia can affect periorbital muscles (blepharospasm, usually bilateral) or lower facial muscles (oromandibular dystonia). This patient has rapid, brief facial movements that are not characteristic of dystonia."
