He has classic symptoms of fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, cognitive symptoms, and dry hair and skin with physical findings of delayed deep tendon reflexes and bradycardia (although he is taking a β-blocker). Levothyroxine is recommended as the preparation of choice for the treatment of hypothyroidism because of its efficacy in resolving the symptoms of hypothyroidism, long-term evidence of benefits, favorable adverse effect profile, ease of administration, good intestinal absorption, long serum half-life, and low cost. The treatment goals are to normalize serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (in primary hypothyroidism) or free thyroxine (T",

Thyroid hormone therapy, with its inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, is a potential cause of angina in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. This risk is the reason for starting patients with low doses of thyroid hormone replacement, and increasing the dose slowly. Assessment of the adequacy of treatment should be done with a repeat serum TSH level at least 6 weeks after initiation or change in dose."
