"). Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by the subacute onset of pain and swelling in multiple joints, including the proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet, metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, wrists, knees, and ankles. Prolonged morning stiffness is common; physical examination reveals polyarticular synovitis. Joint involvement is characteristically symmetric. Distal interphalangeal joints are rarely, if ever, involved. Laboratory studies supporting the diagnosis include rheumatoid factor (present in 70% of patients, but of limited specificity), anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (present in 70% of patients and 95% specific), and elevated inflammatory markers."

Although polyarticular synovitis may be present initially, joint swelling resolves in days to weeks in most cases. Onset typically occurs after exposure to a parvovirus-infected child, such as in a daycare setting. Adults with parvovirus B19 arthritis usually do not display the characteristic “slapped cheek” rash seen in children. Anti–cyclic citrullinated antibodies are typically absent."

"). SLE arthritis can have an acute or subacute onset; can be mono-, oligo-, or polyarticular; frequently affects small joints of the hands, elbows, and knees; and can lead to malalignment deformities similar to rheumatoid arthritis. However, SLE arthritis does not lead to underlying bony erosions as seen in rheumatoid arthritis. The number of joints involved is usually fewer than seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Characteristic mucocutaneous findings of SLE accompany arthritis onset, including malar rash, discoid rash, and alopecia. Systemic involvement (e.g., leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nephritis) may also be present. Almost all patients with SLE will be positive for antinuclear antibodies. Because this patient lacks any additional features of SLE, and because positivity for anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies is not a feature of SLE arthritis, a diagnosis of SLE is unlikely."
