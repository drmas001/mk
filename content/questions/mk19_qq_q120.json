His walking to the bedroom in the dark and resulting mechanical stumble may have caused the fall. An evaluation for home safety is always an appropriate consideration for patients who have fallen, because hazards are found in two thirds of homes. It would be important to know if he has night lights in each room, because lack of proper lighting would contribute to his risk for falls. Installing night lights in each room is a simple and inexpensive fall prevention strategy. Other potential modifiable home safety issues related to falls include the presence of rugs, thresholds between rooms, general clutter, uneven lighting, and unsafe or absent handrails."
