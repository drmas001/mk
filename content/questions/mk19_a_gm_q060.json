The American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway recommends that moderate hypertriglyceridemia be initially treated by addressing lifestyle factors (obesity, metabolic syndrome); reducing dietary intake of added sugar and total fat; restricting or abstaining from alcohol; managing secondary factors (diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or kidney disease and/or nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism); and avoiding medications that increase triglyceride levels (estrogens, β-blockers, glucocorticoids). In addition to adhering to a low-calorie diet to achieve a 5% to 10% weight loss, this patient should engage in physical activity. The AHA/ACC primary prevention guideline recommends at least 150 min/wk of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)."

This patient does not fall into one of the two high-risk groups that benefited from treatment with icosapent ethyl and statin therapy."
