Tinea pedis can have a more acute form, with 1- to 2-mm vesicles, and can be extremely pruritic. The interdigital variant of tinea pedis shows fissures and maceration in the folds (as ",

Tinea should be treated to prevent skin breakdown, which can be an entry port for bacterial infection. Dermatophytosis of non–hair-bearing skin with limited involvement can be treated topically with the use of topical terbinafine or imidazole creams, such as miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole, applied once to twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks, ensuring that the application extends a few centimeters beyond the advancing border. Combined antifungals and topical glucocorticoids should be avoided because they can lead to increased recurrences and treatment failures."
