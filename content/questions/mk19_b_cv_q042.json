") to identify the location of the AAA (suprarenal, juxtarenal, or infrarenal) and plan for repair. Because of the high mortality rate associated with aneurysm rupture, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time screening with duplex ultrasonography in all men aged 65 to 75 years who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and selective screening in men in this age group who have never smoked. The choice between open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is driven by the location of the AAA and involvement of the renal and mesenteric arteries. Suprarenal and juxtarenal aneurysms often necessitate open surgical repair, whereas infrarenal aneurysms often can be treated with EVAR. Other factors, including patient age, comorbid conditions, and ability to tolerate open surgical repair, also determine which procedure should be performed in patients with an infrarenal AAA."
