"This patient has a ruptured popliteal (Baker) cyst. This picture demonstrates the “crescent sign,” an ecchymotic area below the medial malleolus, that suggests cyst rupture. A popliteal cyst is a benign swelling of the synovial bursa behind the knee joint; synovial fluid fills the cyst. Popliteal cysts most commonly develop in the setting of knee trauma, osteoarthritis, or inflammatory arthritis, but can occur in patients without joint disease. They are frequently asymptomatic but can present with posterior knee pain and swelling. In rare instances, cysts may cause compression of adjacent structures, leading to compression syndrome, posterior tibial nerve entrapment, or popliteal artery occlusion. Ruptured cysts may mimic deep venous thromboses (pseudothrombophlebitis) and may be associated with ecchymosis from the popliteal fossa to the ankle. In patients with asymptomatic popliteal cysts, no treatment is necessary. Symptomatic patients often experience relief with joint aspiration and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection. Pseudothrombophlebitis can be treated with rest, elevation, and NSAIDs. The posterior view of a different patient ",
