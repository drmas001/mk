Low back pain and paresthesias are common, and patients may exhibit dysautonomia with arrhythmias and labile blood pressures; respiratory failure may develop. In addition to flaccid paralysis, the physical examination typically reveals diffuse areflexia and little sensory loss. Treatment consists of either plasmapheresis or intravenous immune globulin."
