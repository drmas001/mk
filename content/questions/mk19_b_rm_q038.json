"). This patient has dermatomyositis. A muscle biopsy is not necessary to diagnose dermatomyositis in patients with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings, including proximal muscle weakness, strikingly elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and skin manifestations that are unique to dermatomyositis. The most typical feature is the Gottron rash (Gottron papules and Gottron sign), which is characterized by erythematous to violaceous areas over the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. There is an association between risk for malignancy and dermatomyositis (3- to 12-fold higher in patients with new dermatomyositis than in age-matched populations) and, to a lesser extent, polymyositis. The risk for malignancy is greatest in the 3 years following the diagnosis of dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Common associated cancers are ovarian, lung, pancreas, stomach, and colon cancer and lymphoma. The most important initial step is symptom-directed testing and age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening because patients with active malignancy associated with dermatomyositis need prompt, appropriate treatment for both cancer and the autoimmune disease. If an initial directed cancer screen is normal, many experts will order CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Because this patient has unintentional weight loss and anemia, the first test should be a colonoscopy to assess for colorectal cancer."
