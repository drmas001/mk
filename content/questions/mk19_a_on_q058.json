"). Based on the results of clinical staging, this patient has a T2N0, stage I cancer of the upper third of the rectum. If pathology following surgery confirms these preoperative findings, then no further therapy would be warranted. Therefore, for stage I rectal cancer, surgery alone is the preferred initial management. With the tumor located 10 cm from the anal verge, the surgical procedure of choice would be a low anterior resection, performed with the total mesorectal excision technique, with either a direct anastomosis, or, more likely, a temporary diverting ileostomy, which would be reversed after 2 to 3 months. Such a resection would be anticipated to be sphincter-sparing, and so the patient should not require a permanent colostomy. After therapy, patients with rectal cancer should be evaluated at approximately 6-month intervals for up to 5 years with a history, physical examination, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen level assessment. Contrast-enhanced CTs of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are typically obtained annually for 5 years."

"). Evidence is insufficient to define an optimal sequencing of the three treatment modalities, although total neoadjuvant therapy in which all planned chemotherapy and irradiation is given before surgery, is becoming a more widespread practice. Capecitabine, an oral prodrug that is converted into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), or, less commonly, intravenous 5-FU, is given concurrently with radiation therapy (",
