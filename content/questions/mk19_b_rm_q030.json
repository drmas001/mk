"). This patient has symptoms of inflammatory back pain with sacroiliitis consistent with ankylosing spondylitis. She has developed symptoms at a young age (<45 years) and has morning stiffness, nighttime pain, improvement of symptoms with exercise and ibuprofen, and a history of uveitis. Her decreased range of motion of the lumbar spine in all directions is typical of this disease. Early in the disease, radiographs may be normal. When plain radiographs are normal and the clinical suspicion is high on the basis of history and physical examination, MRI of the pelvis may reveal erosions, edema, fatty metaplasia, and changes of inflammation (synovitis, enthesitis, or capsulitis) along the sacroiliac joints. These changes are diagnostic of inflammatory spondylitis. Later in the disease, plain radiographs of the sacroiliac joints may show narrowing, erosions, sclerosis, or fusion. Later findings on plain radiographs of the lumbar spine may reveal early squaring of the vertebral bodies, followed by syndesmophyte formation."

MRI is more specific than bone scanning in the detection of early sacroiliitis and is preferred when plain radiography is nondiagnostic."

") are diagnostic tests for rheumatoid arthritis. Results of these tests are not typically positive in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Rheumatoid arthritis does not cause low back pain because it does not affect the lumbar spine. This patient has no peripheral inflammatory joint symptoms consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, so these tests are not indicated. Although adults with rheumatoid arthritis may have eye involvement, it is typically scleritis, not uveitis as in this patient."
