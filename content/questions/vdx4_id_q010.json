" Paratyphi (A, B, and C) cause prolonged febrile and often serious infection (typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever). Infection is acquired by consuming food or water contaminated by organisms shed in the stool of infected humans. The disease is characterized by the gradual onset of fever with headache, arthralgia, myalgia, pharyngitis, and anorexia that follows a 1- to 2-week incubation period. Abdominal pain and tenderness can be accompanied by early-onset diarrhea, which may spontaneously resolve or become severe late in disease. Twenty percent of patients have constipation at diagnosis. In untreated illness, temperature progressively increases and may remain elevated (up to 40 °C [104 °F]) for 4 to 8 weeks. A pulse-temperature dissociation (relative bradycardia) and prostration are common."
