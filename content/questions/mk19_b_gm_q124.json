"). This hospitalized patient has oxygen desaturations that correspond with his physical position and sleep status but no examination findings suggestive of a primary pulmonary process. He has several risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), including an elevated BMI, hypertension, snoring, a large neck, and male sex. This clinical scenario is most consistent with OSA-related desaturations in the setting of supine positioning and somnolence due to recent anesthesia. OSA is exceedingly common in both men and women older than 50 years, and it remains undiagnosed in the majority of patients with the condition. Before surgery, all patients should be screened for OSA, which is associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, including cardiac events, pulmonary complications, and ICU admissions. A commonly used preoperative screening tool for OSA is the STOP-BANG score (1 point each for Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apneas, elevated blood Pressure, BMI >35, Age >50 years, Neck circumference >40 cm, and male Gender)."
