"). This patient's recurrent acute flares of pain and swelling in the wrists and third metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint are consistent with acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (pseudogout). The radiograph of the MCP joints shows a small hooked osteophyte of the left third MCP joint. Hooked osteophytes of the second and third MCP joints are a characteristic feature of CPP crystal arthritis. The radiograph of the wrist shows calcification along the fibroarticular cartilage consistent with chondrocalcinosis. Synovial fluid analysis shows CPP crystals, which confirm the diagnosis. Given the patient's age (<60 years), secondary causes of CPP deposition (such as hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, hypophosphatasia, hypomagnesemia, and hemochromatosis) should be sought. Her normal comprehensive metabolic panel, serum magnesium level, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level exclude all secondary causes other than hemochromatosis. Measurements of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are appropriate screening tests for hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis typically presents in men age 40 years or older and in women generally after menopause because of slower iron accumulation in the premenopausal years."
