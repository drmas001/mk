It is more common in patients with other autoimmune disorders or a family history of thyroid autoimmunity. Diffuse goiter is most common in younger patients. Most patients (90%) have TPO antibodies, and the risk for developing hypothyroidism is four times higher in euthyroid patients with TPO antibodies."
