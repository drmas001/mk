"). The pain associated with plantar fasciitis is typically sharp in character and present with the first few steps taken after prolonged inactivity, such as upon awakening in the morning or after sitting for an extended period of time. Plantar fasciitis has a peak incidence between the ages of 40 and 60 years. Risk factors include obesity, pes planus, and a sedentary lifestyle. On examination, there is pain with palpation of the medial calcaneal tubercle where the plantar fascia inserts. Pain is also typically elicited with passive dorsiflexion of the toes and calcaneal palpation."

") commonly occurs during strenuous activities, although it may occur spontaneously in the elderly or with fluoroquinolone use. Patients usually have heel pain and may report hearing a “pop.” On examination, a tendon defect may be palpable; a lack of plantar flexion with calf squeezing (Thompson test) suggests complete rupture (sensitivity, 93%; specificity. This patient's heel pain is not consistent with Achilles tendon rupture."

On examination, pain may be reproduced with nerve tapping (Tinel sign) and with provocative measures that compress the nerve (plantar flexion-inversion and dorsiflexion-eversion tests). This patient's findings are not compatible with tarsal tunnel syndrome."
