") every 6 months. Adults with cirrhosis are at the highest risk for HCC and should undergo surveillance regardless of the cause of cirrhosis. In most patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, cure rates seen with direct-acting antiviral agents exceed 90%. Sustained virologic response is defined as a negative HCV RNA result 12 weeks after therapy and defines virologic cure. Virologic cure is associated with reduced risk for progression to cirrhosis, cirrhosis complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality. The risk for HCC in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis who achieve virologic cure after antiviral treatment is lowered, but not eliminated; therefore, patients with cirrhosis and treated HCV infection should undergo surveillance for HCC every 6 months. The addition of α-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement to ultrasonography increases the sensitivity of HCC detection but also increases the false-positive rate. No available information indicates that the addition of AFP measurement to biannual ultrasonography leads to improved survival. Therefore, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommends surveillance using ultrasonography with or without AFP every 6 months."
