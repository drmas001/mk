She also has other nonspecific symptoms (achiness, fatigue, and Raynaud phenomenon) that are common in patients with Sjögren syndrome. Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are the most specific diagnostic test.

Cryoglobulinemia almost always causes a rash (e.g., leukocytoclastic vasculitis manifesting as palpable purpura) and often causes mononeuritis multiplex and arthralgia. Kidney disease, usually membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, is also frequently seen. Rheumatoid factor and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are expected in cryoglobulinemia, but the rest of this patient's clinical picture does not support the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia."
