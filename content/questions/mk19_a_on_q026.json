") to prevent tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS occurs when tumor cells release their contents into the bloodstream, either spontaneously or as a result of treatment, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. These electrolyte abnormalities can lead to acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death. The risk of TLS can be categorized based on the volume of cancer mass present, the cell-lysis potential of the cancer, and patient characteristics of preexisting kidney failure, dehydration, acidosis, hypotension, or nephrotoxin exposure. TLS is seen most often in patients with highly proliferative hematologic malignancies, such as acute leukemia and high-grade lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, but can develop in other cancers. Patients at intermediate risk for TLS can be managed with monitoring of laboratory values, hydration, and allopurinol, and those at high risk, such as this patient, should receive vigorous intravenous hydration and rasburicase, a urate oxidase enzyme that metabolizes urate to allantoin, before receiving chemotherapy. Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and allopurinol should be used instead."

") may be used to prevent TLS in patients at intermediate risk. Allopurinol is not the first-line agent for prophylaxis in patients at high risk for TLS because it does not work as quickly or consistently as rasburicase. Allopurinol prevents the formation of serum urate through xanthine oxidase inhibition but does not reduce existing serum urate levels by metabolizing urate to a more soluble metabolic end product as does rasburicase."
