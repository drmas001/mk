"). Smoking is the most important risk factor for the development of lung cancer, and risk increases with additional years of tobacco exposure and age. Lung cancer has a poor prognosis, and nearly 90% of persons with lung cancer die of the disease. However, early-stage non–small cell lung cancer has a better prognosis and can be treated with surgical resection. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend lung cancer screening with an annual low-dose CT scan for persons aged 50 years to 80 years with at least a 20-pack-year smoking history and who are still smoking or who quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. Shared decision making, including providing patients with information about radiation exposure with CT, risk for false-positive diagnoses, and anxiety related to surveillance of slow-growing lung nodules, is a crucial element in making the decision to screen. Screening alone cannot prevent most lung cancer–related deaths, and smoking cessation is essential. This patient has a significant smoking history within the past 15 years and should be offered screening."
