"). His presentation is characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is defined as excessive anxiety and worry about various events or activities for at least 6 months, difficulty exercising control over worrying, the presence of several symptoms associated with the anxiety (fatigue, irritability, restlessness, sleep disturbance, or difficulty concentrating), and functional impairment. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are equally effective in treating patients with GAD. CBT is the psychotherapy of choice. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine receptor inhibitors (SNRIs) have proven efficacy in treating GAD, are relatively safe and well tolerated, and are approved by the FDA for this indication."
