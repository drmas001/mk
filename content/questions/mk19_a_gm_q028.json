"). Classically a disorder of runners, ITBS is an overuse injury that can be localized over the lateral femoral condyle. Pain is reported in the lateral knee and/or the distal lateral thigh. ITBS also can occur in competitive cyclists who pedal against resistance. The Noble test consists of repeated flexion and extension of the supine patient's knee with the thumb over the lateral femoral condyle. If this test reproduces the pain, the result is considered diagnostic. Imaging is not necessary to diagnose ITBS. Initial treatment of ITBS involves abstaining from inciting activities and use of ice, followed by a gradual return to activity, stretching, strengthening, and local massage."

") is usually posttraumatic rather than insidious in onset. Pain is in the lateral joint line. Meniscal injury can be differentiated from ITBS by a positive result on the McMurray or Thessaly test and a negative Noble test result. The McMurray test is performed with the patient supine. The examiner fully flexes the knee and rotates the tibia externally. The knee is then extended with the hand over the medial joint line. The maneuver is then repeated with the tibia internally rotated and the hand over the lateral joint line. Snapping detected over the joint line with extension of the knee is a positive result for meniscal injury. The Thessaly test for meniscal tear is performed by holding the patient's outstretched hands while the patient stands on the uninjured leg with the knee flexed to 5 degrees; the other knee is flexed with the foot off the floor. The patient rotates the body internally and externally on the knee three times. The test is repeated with the knee flexed to 20 degrees. This process is repeated with the injured knee. Medial or lateral joint line pain is a positive result for meniscal tear."

") is also common in runners, primarily women. Although it causes knee pain, patellofemoral pain syndrome tends to be associated with generalized pain or pain located anteriorly. Crepitus with movement can be present on physical examination. Almost universally, squatting elicits knee pain. Given this patient's physical examination findings, patellofemoral pain syndrome is unlikely."
