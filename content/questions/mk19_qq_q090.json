") is the next step in management. SCC is the second most common skin cancer and arises from epidermal keratinocytes. Histopathologic examination is needed to confirm the diagnosis and for staging and prognosis. This can be achieved with an excisional biopsy or with a shave or punch biopsy. Smoking is a risk factor for SCC; other risk factors include sun exposure, human papillomavirus infection, immunosuppression, fair skin or hair color, older age, history of nonmelanoma skin malignancy, and arsenic exposure. SCC can have multiple appearances, including papules, plaques, and nodules that can ulcerate, bleed, or become crusty. SCC of the nail unit commonly arises in the nail fold and appears as a hyperkeratotic papule and plaque. In lightly pigmented skin, SCC tends to occur in areas of sun exposure. In patients with darker skin, SCC more often develops on areas of chronic inflammation or scarring and more commonly on the lower extremities. High-risk factors for SCC are tumor diameter greater than 2 cm, tumor thickness greater than 2 mm, poorly differentiated subtypes, perineural invasion, and tumor location on the ear or nonglabrous lip. SCC can be locally invasive and can metastasize."

") is a topical treatment for warts. Warts are usually self-limited; however, in severe cases, including those with a protracted course or in persons who are immunocompromised, destructive treatments can be used. Location of the lesions must be taken into account when selecting treatment, which can be associated with pigment change or scarring. Numerous treatments that focus on destroying infected keratinocytes are available. Common warts are not found on lips in immunocompetent patients and do not ulcerate; topical treatment with tricarboxylic acid is not correct."
