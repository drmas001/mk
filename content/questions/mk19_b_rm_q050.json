Current medications are maximum dosages of celecoxib, duloxetine, and acetaminophen."

Total joint replacement is a curative option for patients in whom conservative therapy has failed; it relieves pain and improves function. Overall, outcomes are excellent, with small risk for hardware loosening and late infection. Osteotomy is an alternative for younger patients with varus or valgus knee and predominantly unicompartmental disease."
