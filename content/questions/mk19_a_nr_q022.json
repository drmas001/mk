") coupled with gait assessment. The patient has signs and symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) (gait changes, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment). Gait impairment, the most prominent feature, is characterized by shuffling short step length and often problems with starting ambulation (hesitation). The feet can appear as though they are stuck to the ground, which is described as a “magnetic” gait. In addition, this patient's MRI of the brain shows communicating (nonobstructive) hydrocephalus. NPH is treated by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed by a neurosurgeon. Before treatment is attempted, a test that predicts response to shunting is necessary. This test assesses the patient's gait after removal of 30 to 50 mL of CSF. The patient's walking is timed immediately before and after lumbar puncture. An objective measure of gait improvement is the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), which measures the amount of time necessary to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn, return to the chair, and sit. An improvement in time by more than 5 seconds is predictive of a positive response to CSF shunting."
