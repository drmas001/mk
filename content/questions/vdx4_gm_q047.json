"The most likely diagnosis is greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS; formerly known as trochanteric bursitis). Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by GTPS or meralgia paresthetica. Pain that worsens with lying on the affected side suggests GTPS; the pain may also radiate to the buttock or knee if the iliotibial band is also affected. Pain also commonly occurs with walking, prolonged standing, and climbing stairs. Patients may often localize the pain by pointing with one finger over the greater trochanter. The most common examination finding in GTPS is tenderness to palpation of the greater trochanter. Pain secondary to hip arthritis is more commonly felt in the anterior region of the hip and groin."
