"). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased risk for colorectal, cervical, and skin cancers. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening women aged 21 to 65 years every 3 years with cytology (Pap test). In women aged 30 to 65 years who want to extend the screening interval, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (preferred) or cytology combined with high-risk HPV testing can be performed every 5 years. However, women with IBD have increased risk for cervical dysplasia; this risk is greater in women using immunosuppressive therapy. Women with IBD receiving immunosuppressive therapy should undergo Pap testing annually. Patients with IBD also have increased risk for vaccine-preventable illnesses. Inactivated vaccines can be safely administered to all patients with IBD, regardless of immunosuppression. Depression and anxiety are more common in patients with IBD than in the general population, and screening is recommended. Patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease should undergo yearly melanoma screening, and those receiving immunomodulators should be screened for nonmelanoma squamous cell cancer while using these agents."

The presence of IBD is not an indication to routinely screen for anal cancer."

After a negative screening colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed every 1 to 5 years based on risk factors for colorectal cancer, considering current and previous burden of colonic inflammation, family history of colorectal cancer, primary sclerosing cholangitis, history of colorectal dysplasia, and frequency and quality of previous surveillance examinations. Because this patient has had IBD for only 2 years, surveillance colonoscopy is not yet necessary."
