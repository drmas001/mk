"). This patient has focal mononeuropathy of the peroneal nerve. Foot drop can be caused by injury to the peroneal nerve, sciatic nerve, or lumbar L5 nerve root or by a central nervous system lesion. In this patient, the distribution of motor and sensory deficits and the electromyography finding of focal slowing of peroneal nerve conduction around the fibular neck points toward an injury of the peroneal nerve around its most common site of compression around the fibular neck. There is no electromyographic or clinical evidence of injury affecting a more proximal site, and no upper motor neuron findings support a central cause. Most peroneal mononeuropathies are caused by compression due to frequent crossing of legs, weight loss, or trauma. In addition to advising the patient to avoid crossing his legs, stretching exercises to maintain range of motion and use of an ankle orthosis to compensate for foot drop may be considered."
