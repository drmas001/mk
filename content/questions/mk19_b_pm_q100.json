"), a rare but potentially lethal complication resulting from systemic manifestations of fat emboli. Most commonly associated with long bone and pelvic fractures, fat embolism syndrome can also be associated with nontraumatic conditions such as pancreatitis, osteomyelitis, and lipid infusion. It is a clinical diagnosis centered on the triad of respiratory insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, and petechial rash in an appropriate clinical setting. Although not always present, the petechial rash is characteristically located on nondependent parts of the body such as the neck and chest. Onset of fat embolism syndrome typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after a fracture but may occur as early as 12 hours after. Chest radiographs may be normal. Chest CT findings are nonspecific and primarily parenchymal; bilateral well-demarcated ground-glass opacities or ill-defined centrilobular nodules may be noted. Fat has low attenuation, and it is uncommon to find filling defects on CT angiography. Treatment is supportive, and most patients with fat embolism syndrome fully recover, although estimates of mortality range from 5% to 20%."

Additionally, symptoms of air embolism develop immediately after the inciting event. A variety of mechanisms are responsible for air embolism, including neurosurgical and otolaryngologic surgical procedures, penetrating leg wounds or blunt chest trauma, insertion of vascular catheters, and barotrauma associated with positive pressure ventilation."
