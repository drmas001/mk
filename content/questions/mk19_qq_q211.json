"). This patient smokes and has an intermittent cough and dyspnea, and he likely has COPD. Dyspnea and productive cough are characteristic symptoms of COPD; however, the presentation is variable, and the cough can be nonproductive. Diagnosis requires the presence of appropriate symptoms and spirometric findings of fixed airflow obstruction. Spirometry should be performed before and after bronchodilator treatment in patients who present with progressive dyspnea, chronic cough, or chronic sputum production, particularly if a risk factor (such as smoking or occupational inhalation exposure) is present. The role of screening spirometry in asymptomatic individuals with risk factors is controversial. Spirometry measures FEV",
