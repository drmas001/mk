According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, women younger than 30 years require a Pap smear every 3 years but do not require co-testing for HPV. Women aged 30 years or older should be screened every 5 years with a Pap smear and HPV co-testing. If HPV co-testing is unavailable, patients can be screened every 3 years with Pap testing only. The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals with a cervix initiate cervical cancer screening at age 25 years and undergo HPV testing every 5 years through age 65 years; if primary HPV testing is not available, then individuals aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with co-testing (HPV testing in combination with cytology) every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years."
