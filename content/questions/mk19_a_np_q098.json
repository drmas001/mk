"). Reduction of muscle mass, as seen in amputees and those with malnutrition or muscle wasting, can result in a lower serum creatinine concentration without a change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Because of decreased muscle mass, serum creatinine overestimates kidney function in older persons, especially women. Young persons and men often have higher muscle mass and higher serum creatinine concentration at a given GFR compared with older persons and thus underestimates kidney function in this population. This patient's elevated serum creatinine level is likely the result of increased muscle mass. Serum cystatin C is an alternative marker of GFR that is less influenced than serum creatinine by age, sex, muscle mass, and body weight. Cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells, completely filtered by glomeruli, and then metabolized by renal tubules; serum levels thus provide an index of GFR. Serum cystatin C is more sensitive in identifying milder decrements in kidney function than serum creatinine."
