Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and she takes no medications."

"). The patient has an indeterminate pulmonary nodule and requires further follow-up evaluation. Pulmonary nodules can be classified as solid or subsolid. The subsolid nodule classification is further subdivided into pure ground-glass nodules and part-solid nodules. The evaluation of pure ground-glass nodules is informed primarily by nodule size. An incidentally found ground-glass nodule of 6 mm or larger necessitates follow-up chest CT at 6 to 12 months. If the nodule persists but is unchanged in size, as in this patient, chest CT should be repeated at 2-year intervals for 5 years. Earlier follow-up is unlikely to affect the outcome of these characteristically indolent lesions. Studies have shown that an average of 3 to 4 years is typically required to establish growth or, less commonly, to diagnose a developing invasive carcinoma. Many ground-glass nodules resolve spontaneously because they can also be from infectious or inflammatory causes. If the nodule resolves, no further follow-up is needed. If the nodule grows or develops a solid component, biopsy or resection is recommended."
