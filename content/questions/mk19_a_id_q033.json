The peripheral blood smear also shows yeast cells within a leukocyte, characteristic of disseminated histoplasmosis. Furthermore, the patient has several risk factors, including living in an endemic area and taking immunosuppressant medication; treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors (e.g., infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab) is an increasingly recognized cause of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
