This patient has early-stage and low-risk disease, and large case series have demonstrated that radical trachelectomy (in which the cervix is removed) and cervical conization are both effective procedures associated with low risks of recurrence. The choice between trachelectomy and conization is determined by depth of microscopic invasion, among other factors. Only select patients with low-risk disease are appropriate candidates for these procedures. Large series have demonstrated that pregnancy rates are approximately 50%, and many women may become pregnant spontaneously."
