Guidelines support collection of blood cultures, measurement of serum lactate levels, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and initiation of intravenous crystalloid fluid in patients with hypotension or signs of hypoperfusion, all within 1 hour. The goal of initial fluid resuscitation of a patient with severe sepsis or septic shock is maintaining adequate tissue perfusion. The defining features of inadequate tissue perfusion may include any of the following: low arterial or venous pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, central venous oxygen saturation less than 70%, oliguria, acidosis, delirium, cold extremities, elevated blood lactate, and livedo reticularis."

Vasopressor therapy should not be administered before adequate volume replacement. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines support using norepinephrine as first-line therapy in patients who require vasopressor support, as it increases systemic vascular resistance without compromising myocardial performance (stroke volume or cardiac output). In cases in which norepinephrine alone is insufficient, secondary agents, including epinephrine, vasopressin (",
