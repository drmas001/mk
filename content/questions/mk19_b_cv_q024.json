"). In women with angina symptoms, nonobstructive coronary stenoses are present on coronary angiography in more than 50% of cases, and microvascular dysfunction (endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent) is thought to be a predominant cause of symptoms in these patients. Although the epicardial coronary arteries are easily visualized via coronary angiography, the coronary microcirculation (vessels <0.5 mm in diameter) is not easily visualized yet accounts for approximately 70% of the coronary resistance in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Impaired microcirculation can be determined by several provocative tests in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Clinical disorders of coronary microvascular dysfunction have largely been described in patients presenting with stable angina."

ECG abnormalities may be nonspecific or mimic ST-elevation myocardial infarction patterns. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and often involves coronary angiography to exclude fixed disease. Administration of nitrates or calcium channel blockers during cardiac catheterization may show coronary dilatation, which may indicate a vasospastic vessel."

") is a common cause of chest pain among younger women during the peripartum period. SCAD involves development of a nontraumatic and noniatrogenic intramural hematoma, with or without intimal dissection with luminal communication. The enlarging hematoma in the false lumen compresses the true lumen of the coronary artery and if combined with obstructing dissection, leads to chest pain, ischemia, and/or infarction. Indicative findings on coronary angiography, including multiple radiolucent lumens and periluminal contrast staining, are absent in this patient."
