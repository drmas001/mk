"). Major medical organizations and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that screening for HCV be conducted in all individuals aged 18 to 79 years with anti-HCV antibody testing, followed by PCR testing for HCV RNA. Most adults need to be screened only once. Persons with continued risk for HCV infection (e.g., persons using injected drugs) should be screened periodically. There is limited information about the specific screening interval that should occur in persons who continue to be at risk for new HCV infection, and the USPSTF makes no recommendation regarding frequency. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years. Younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk of infection should also be screened. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine appropriate or optimal time intervals or strategies for repeat HIV screening. Repeat screening is reasonable for persons known to be at increased risk of HIV infection."

"The USPSTF recommends screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in adolescents and adults at increased risk for infection. Persons born in countries with a prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of 2% or greater account for the majority of cases of new chronic HBV infection in the United States and should be screened; HBV screening should also be offered to groups defined by clinical and behavioral characteristics in which prevalence of positive HBsAg is 2% or greater. This includes persons who have injected drugs in the past or who do so currently; men who have sex with men; persons with HIV; and sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, and household contacts of persons known to be HBsAg-positive. This patient is not at increased risk for HBV. Therefore, routine screening for HBV is not indicated (",

"The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 years has substantial net benefit. HCV infection is the most common chronic bloodborne pathogen in the United States and a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease. HCV infection is associated with more deaths than the top 60 other reportable infectious diseases combined, including HIV. Direct-acting antivirals offer a cure to more than 95% of patients, but less than 10% have actually received them. The estimated prevalence of HIV infection among persons aged 13 years and older in the United States is 0.4% (0.7% in males and 0.2% in females), and data from the CDC show a significant increase in HIV diagnoses starting at age 15 years. Therefore, this 18-year-old man be screened for both HCV and HIV, not HCV alone (",
