Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is based on the Amsel criteria, which requires presence of three of the following four criteria: vaginal pH greater than 4.5; thin, homogeneous vaginal discharge; a positive amine (whiff) test result in which application of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) to vaginal secretions results in a fishy odor; and at least 20% clue cells on saline wet mount. This patient meets all four Amsel criteria and can begin treatment for bacterial vaginosis. Recommended treatment of bacterial vaginosis includes metronidazole (oral or vaginal gel) or clindamycin (vaginal cream). Suggested alternative regimens include clindamycin (oral), secnidazole (oral), and tinidazole (oral)."
