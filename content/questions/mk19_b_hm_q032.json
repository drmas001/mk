He also has an IgG λ monoclonal gammopathy detectable in the serum, which further confirms a plasma cell dyscrasia. Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy that demonstrates characteristic apple green birefringence with Congo red staining. Fat pad biopsy is preferred even in multiorgan involvement because it is less invasive than biopsying other organs (sensitivity, 60%-80%). If unrevealing, kidney, bone marrow, or other organ biopsy can be performed (",
