"). Smoldering multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a serum M protein level of 3 g/dL (30 g/L) or greater (or â‰¥500 mg/24 hr of urinary monoclonal free light chains) or bone marrow plasma clonal cells of 10% to 59% and no evidence of myeloma-related signs or symptoms. All patients with MM should be assessed for skeletal lesions at diagnosis, periodically thereafter, and when new symptoms occur. Skeletal survey following a negative low-dose CT scan would not provide any value. Low-dose CT and PET-CT scan are recommended as the initial imaging procedure because of increased sensitivity. CT is preferred because of its relatively high sensitivity, speed, and patient convenience. If initial imaging with whole-body low-dose CT is negative, whole-body MRI is recommended. MRI has been found to be more sensitive in identifying myeloma-related bone lesions and soft tissue lesions from plasmacytoma but is more inconvenient for the patient. If more than one lesion greater than 5 mm is discovered, the patient should be considered to have MM requiring therapy. In this patient with smoldering MM, negative findings on whole-body low-dose CT scan does not exclude skeletal lesions, and MRI is needed for further evaluation."
