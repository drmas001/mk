"). His symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, hypotension, and flank pain, appeared within 15 minutes of transfusion initiation and are typical for an acute hemolytic reaction. The pink color of the urine suggests the release of free hemoglobin resulting from intravascular hemolysis. An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is most often caused by an ABO incompatibility, either because the pilot tube used to type and crossmatch the patient was mislabeled or because the unit of blood was administered to the wrong patient. Hemolysis may also be caused by an alloantibody that was too low to be detected in his pretransfusion evaluation, but this is more likely to cause a more gradual delayed hemolytic reaction rather than an acute and life-threatening event. The transfusion must be stopped because the degree of hemolysis and prognosis is proportional to the volume transfused. Volume expansion and supportive care for associated complications are also necessary. An investigation into the cause of the reaction is initiated in each case, including a repeat type and screen and a direct antiglobulin test. Additional laboratory evaluation will support the diagnosis of hemolysis and assess for the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation."
