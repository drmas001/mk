It can be uncomplicated (sterile and free flowing) or complicated (infected or loculated). Uncomplicated effusions are typically small and resolve on their own with treatment of the pneumonia. Complicated parapneumonic effusions occur with significant inflammation or when bacteria invade the pleural space. An empyema is defined as a bacterial infection of the pleural space, which results in purulent fluid or a positive Gram stain. This patient's CT imaging ",
