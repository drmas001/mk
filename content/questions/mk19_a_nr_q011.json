"). This patient has signs, symptoms, and MRI findings concerning for Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) disease. MRI is one of the most sensitive diagnostic tools for CJD, typically showing a pattern of increased intensity in the diffusion-weighted sequence in the basal ganglia and various cortical regions. CJD is a prion-related disorder that often presents with rapidly progressive dementia. The cause of CJD is an abnormally folded prion protein, which occurs by a spontaneous mutation (85%), is acquired by exposure to a transmissible protein, or is an inherited genetic mutation. Prion diseases have no known therapy. Time from disease onset to death is approximately 12 months in as many as 80% of patients with CJD. The rapid cognitive decline seen with this disorder is associated with myoclonus, gait problems, visual compromise, and interruption of the circadian rhythm. The real-time quaking-induced conversion assay is the most sensitive and specific test for prion proteins in the CSF. It uses recombinant prion protein and thioflavin T, a fluorescent dye, to detect prion protein present in the CSF despite its being present in only small quantities. The prion protein in the CSF induces the recombinant prion protein to change shape and form fibrils that bind thioflavin T and begin to fluoresce. The quantity of fluorescence is measured in real time."
