"A 32-year-old woman is seen following evaluation for a single episode of painless hematuria that she noted last week. She has chronic kidney disease secondary to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis confirmed by biopsy. She took Chinese herbal weight loss pills daily for 3 years. She took acetaminophen or ibuprofen for arthralgia three or four times monthly for 5 years. Since the kidney biopsy, she has discontinued all drugs and supplements. She has no other medical problems."

") is the most appropriate management for this patient to assess for evidence of urothelial tumor. Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) in the setting of protracted use of herbal medications, particularly those of Chinese origin, suggests the possibility of aristolochic acid nephropathy. Consequently, this patient may be at increased risk for urothelial cancer despite her young age. CT of the abdomen and pelvis is not sufficiently sensitive to rule out neoplasia of the ureters or bladder."

There is no history of occupational or other environmental exposure, and there is no test available to identify aristolochic acid as the cause of this patient's CTIN. However, given the patient's history of protracted use of herbal medications, it would be prudent to rule out the associated risks of herbal medication use, such as urothelial tumor."
