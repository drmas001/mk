"). The patient's primary symptoms of fever and sore throat are compatible with either a viral upper respiratory tract infection or streptococcal pharyngitis. The Centor criteria (presence of temperature >38.0 °C [100.4 °F], tonsillar exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, absence of cough) predict the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis, and using these criteria is a reasonable way to triage patients for further testing for group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. Patients with fewer than three criteria have a low (<3%) probability of GABHS pharyngitis. Patients with three or more criteria, such as this patient, have an intermediate probability of GABHS pharyngitis; a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) should be performed, with confirmation of negative results with a throat culture only in patients at high risk for complications (immunocompromised patients). The advantage of the RADT is the immediate availability of results and high specificity (between 88% and 99%); if the test is positive, patients should be treated with antibiotics. The RADT has comparable sensitivity and specificity to throat culture. No guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for pharyngitis without confirmatory testing. For patients with confirmed GABHS pharyngitis and penicillin allergy, cephalosporins and macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin (or clindamycin) can be substituted."
