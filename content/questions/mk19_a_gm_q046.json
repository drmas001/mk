"). Adults aged 40 to 75 years without diabetes mellitus and with an LDL cholesterol level of 70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (1.81-4.90 mmol/L) should undergo risk assessment for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the Pooled Cohort Equations. The 10-year risk for ASCVD can be categorized as low (<5%), borderline (5% to <7.5%), intermediate (≥7.5% to <20%), or high (≥20%). In adults at intermediate risk, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. This patient has two risk-enhancing factors: psoriatic arthritis (an inflammatory condition) and a family history of premature ASCVD. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommendations for primary prevention of ASCVD support moderate-intensity statin therapy for this patient. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends low- to moderate-intensity statin therapy for primary prevention in adults who have at least one ASCVD risk factor (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year ASCVD event risk of 10% or higher. The 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/U.S. Department of Defense cholesterol guideline recommends moderate-intensity statin therapy for primary prevention in patients with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 12% or higher, an LDL cholesterol level of 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or greater, or diabetes."
