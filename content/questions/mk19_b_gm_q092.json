"). This patient likely has a postoperative ileus (POI). POI is common after both intra-abdominal and nonabdominal surgery. It is caused by a combination of intraperitoneal inflammation, neuroinhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, and medications (such as opioids and anesthesia). There is no specific therapy for postoperative ileus other than supportive. Supportive therapy consists of minimizing the use of opioids, hydration, bowel rest, electrolyte repletion, postoperative ambulation, and use of chewing gum. Minimally invasive surgical approaches, multimodal analgesia techniques, prophylactic bowel regimens, and early ambulation may help to prevent POI."

"Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) is characterized by acute dilatation of the colon in the absence of a mechanical obstruction. This condition is usually found in severely ill hospitalized patients or after surgery that is complicated by a metabolic disturbance or medications that inhibit peristalsis. Patients have abdominal distention with pain, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Plain radiography documents a dilated colon. The initial management is supportive care, but treatment with neostigmine is often attempted in patients in whom conservative therapy has failed. On the basis of findings on this patient's radiograph, she does not have acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and does not require neostigmine (",
