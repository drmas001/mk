"). Diagnosis of PD is clinical. It requires the presence of bradykinesia (in this patient, the decrements in speed and amplitude of repetitive movements) and at least one other cardinal feature (resting tremor, rigidity, or postural instability). In addition, asymmetry of symptoms and absence of atypical features, such as early dementia and early falls, are consistent with the diagnosis of PD. In the absence of atypical features in her history or physical examination, additional testing is usually not necessary."

") can confirm degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals in PD and differentiate between PD and essential tremor in patients in whom the diagnosis cannot be made on clinical grounds, which is not the case in this patient. The sensitivity of this expensive test, however, is not superior to that of expert clinical assessment. Conventional neuroimaging is not mandatory in patients with a typical clinical presentation and no red flags. However, it is common to perform MRI of the brain to rule out such structural abnormalities as hydrocephalus, diffuse vascular disease or mass lesions that may present with parkinsonism."

"). Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes accumulation of copper in the liver. The accumulation of copper can result in sudden liver failure and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia due to the sudden release of copper from hepatocytes. Neurological changes can be seen in patients with Wilson disease (tremor, early-onset PD, dystonia). Kayser-Fleischer rings can be seen on slit-lamp examination of patients with Wilson disease and neurologic findings. This 72-year-old woman with typical features of PD without red flags does not require testing for Wilson disease."
