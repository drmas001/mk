") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient with carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome develops from increased pressure within the carpal tunnel causing median nerve compression. Diagnosis is usually established based on history. The syndrome presents as wrist pain that may radiate to the forearm and hand; paresthesia and weakness of the first three fingers and thenar eminence (median nerve distribution) may be present. Symptoms are often worse at night and with repetitive wrist motion. Risk factors include obesity, female sex, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and connective tissue disorders. Although keyboard use has been suggested as a risk factor, it has not been confirmed by studies. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome who have active denervation on nerve conduction studies and have muscle weakness and atrophy on clinical examination should undergo decompression surgery to prevent irreversible motor weakness. Uncontrolled pain and sensory symptoms can be another indication for surgery, but in the absence of motor weakness and active denervation, conservative measures to treat pain and control paresthesia should be attempted first."
