"). This rare syndrome is a complication of well-established rheumatoid arthritis characterized by neutropenia and splenomegaly. Patients with Felty syndrome are at risk for serious bacterial infections, lower extremity ulceration, lymphoma, and vasculitis. Patients may present with an asymptomatic decline in the neutrophil count that is detected on routine laboratory testing for medication toxicity. Because a decline in leukocyte count can also be an adverse effect of numerous medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, it is important to evaluate this possibility. However, medications are far less likely to specifically reduce only the neutrophil count and are not likely to be associated with splenomegaly. Some patients present with an infection related to neutropenia. In this instance, the total leukocyte count may be normal at the time of presentation but fall with treatment of the infection. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis can also have large granular lymphocyte syndrome, which can progress to large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Findings overlap with Felty syndrome and include neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and recurrent infections."

") is a rare complication of long-standing and poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. In a minority of patients, it can lead to splenomegaly as a consequence of infiltration of the spleen by amyloid protein. However, AA amyloidosis would not be expected to result in neutropenia, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this patient."

When SLE occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a more typical hematologic picture would include lymphopenia, hemolytic anemia, or thrombocytopenia. A positive antinuclear antibody test result and clinical manifestations seen in SLE but not in rheumatoid arthritis, such as kidney disease, might appear. Similarly, Sjögren syndrome is diagnosed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis when sicca symptoms are present. Typically, this would be accompanied by anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and occasionally anti-La/SSB antibodies."
