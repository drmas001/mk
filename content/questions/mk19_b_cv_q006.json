"). This patient has complex multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) involving the left main coronary artery distal bifurcation, proximal left circumflex artery, and proximal left anterior descending and first diagonal artery bifurcation. CABG, especially with use of arterial (internal mammary artery) conduits, is indicated in patients with multivessel CAD and no contraindications, because it is associated with enhanced survival compared with medical therapy alone. CABG also results in decreased recurrence of angina, lower rates of myocardial infarction, and fewer repeat revascularization procedures compared with percutaneous coronary intervention or medical therapy alone in these patients."

Aspirin, β-blockade, and statin therapy, along with ACE inhibition in patients with systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, such as this patient, are indicated for secondary prevention of major adverse vascular events. However, anti-ischemic and cardioprotective medical therapy would be inferior to revascularization in improving survival in this patient with complex CAD involving the left main coronary artery and a large area of potentially ischemic myocardium."
