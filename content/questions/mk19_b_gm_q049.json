"). Although breast cancer should be considered in all patients, most breast masses, particularly in women younger than 30 years, are benign conditions, such as cysts, fibroadenomas, fat necrosis, or lipomas. Evaluation requires consideration of breast cancer risk factors, including family history of breast or ovarian cancer; previous breast biopsies; hormonal risk factors; and a detailed history of the mass, including onset, changes with the menstrual cycle, associated symptoms, and overlying skin/nipple changes. Women younger than 30 years who present with a breast mass should first be evaluated with breast ultrasonography. Younger women have increased breast density, which decreases the sensitivity of mammography. Ultrasonography is also the preferred imaging modality in pregnant women to avoid radiation exposure. Breast ultrasound results are categorized by Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) criteria. Biopsy is recommended for category 4 and 5 findings. In addition, any suspicious findings, including a hard, fixed, or heterogenous mass on clinical breast examination (CBE), should be evaluated by biopsy, even if imaging is negative."

") is an appropriate first test in a woman aged 30 years or older who presents with a breast mass. Mammography may demonstrate a mass, asymmetric density, or abnormal/pleomorphic calcifications potentially indicating breast cancer. For patients with a focal abnormality noted on mammogram, targeted ultrasonography can clarify the size of the mass, determine whether the mass is solid or cystic, and identify the margins as smooth or irregular. However, this patient is 28 years old, and therefore she should have a breast ultrasonography to evaluate the right breast mass."
