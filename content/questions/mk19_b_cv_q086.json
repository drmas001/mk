"), regardless of the ankle-brachial index value. In patients with intermittent claudication, supervised exercise training is recommended to improve functional status (maximal walking distance and pain-free walking distance) and quality of life and to reduce leg symptoms. Studies with intermediate- and long-term follow-up also have demonstrated a persistent benefit of supervised exercise in these patients. The risk-benefit ratio for supervised exercise is favorable for patients with PAD (including those with comorbid conditions), and training is recommended for a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes, at least three times weekly for a minimum of 12 weeks. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provides reimbursement for supervised exercise programs in patients with symptomatic PAD. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is also recommended to improve symptoms and increase walking distance in patients with claudication."
