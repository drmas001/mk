Most notably, chronic opioid use suppresses gonadotroph function through altered release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, resulting in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Opioids can also increase release of prolactin, further inhibiting gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. In women, this effect may manifest as irregular periods. Men may have signs and symptoms of hypogonadism with laboratory evidence of low testosterone with low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins. No clear guidelines are available for screening for hypogonadism in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy, but discontinuing opioid therapy should result in recovery of gonadal function. If patients cannot discontinue opioid therapy, replacement of estrogen in premenopausal women and testosterone in men is appropriate in the absence of contraindications. Based on this patient's low testosterone level and hypogonadism symptoms, testosterone therapy would be beneficial. Before initiating testosterone therapy in male patients, a thorough medical history, hemoglobin or hematocrit level, and prostate-specific antigen level should be obtained to exclude contraindications."

The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients demonstrated a reduction in the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular-related death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke) and all-cause mortality when empagliflozin was added to standard care versus placebo. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with previous amputation, severe peripheral neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or active diabetic foot ulcers or soft tissue infections.

The mechanism of hyperprolactinemia in hypothyroidism is related to release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, which stimulates both TSH and prolactin.

Biochemical testing for hypercortisolism should be undertaken in all patients with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass, even in the absence of typical symptoms; screening for pheochromocytoma is indicated if the unenhanced CT attenuation is greater than 10 Hounsfield units, even in the absence of hypertension. Most benign adrenal adenomas are smaller than 4 cm and have high lipid content, which corresponds to a density of less than 10 Hounsfield units, and contrast washout is greater than 60% in 10 minutes. This asymptomatic patient with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass has no evidence of hormone excess associated with mild autonomous cortisol excess and has a benign imaging phenotype. Clinical observation can also be considered. A large study of patients with small nonfunctioning adrenal tumors showed significant growth in only 2.5% of tumors at 50 months, and no cases of adrenal carcinoma were diagnosed. Clinically overt hormone excess developed in less than 0.1% of patients."

Positive antibody tests should be followed by confirmatory duodenal biopsy. Consideration should be given to assessing total IgA level, and, if IgA deficiency is present, anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG antibodies or tissue transglutaminase IgG antibodies can be used. In the case of negative serologic tests with high level of suspicion, endoscopy with duodenal biopsy may be indicated. Classic celiac disease is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease involving the small intestine in response to sensitivity to dietary gluten. Celiac disease most commonly presents with diarrhea and evidence of malabsorption. A common skin manifestation is dermatitis herpetiformis, characterized by pruritic inflammatory papules and vesicles on the forearms, knees, lower back, sacrum, and buttocks.

Thyroid storm is differentiated from severe thyrotoxicosis by the presence of life-threatening complications such as hemodynamic compromise; it occurs often with discontinuation of antithyroid drug therapy, systemic illness, labor and delivery, surgery, or trauma. It has a high mortality rate (up to 30%) and requires intensive care for any precipitating illness, thyrotoxicosis-directed therapy, and supportive measures. Thyroid storm is treated with intravenous β-blockers (esmolol); thionamides, typically propylthiouracil, transitioning to methimazole when more stable; intravenous high-dose glucocorticoids; and potassium iodide. To avoid providing iodine substrate to the gland, iodide should be administered more than 1 hour after antithyroid drugs. Glucocorticoid therapy is a potent inhibitor of peripheral thyroxine (T",

Unregulated conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may occur in granulomatous tissue associated with fungal infection, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and lymphoma, leading to increased intestinal absorption of calcium. Vitamin D-dependent hypercalcemia is associated with normal to elevated serum phosphorus levels because vitamin D enhances intestinal absorption of phosphorus, and suppressed PTH secretion reduces kidney phosphorus excretion. In the absence of an established cause of vitamin D-dependent hypercalcemia, such as documented ingestion, a chest radiograph to diagnose sarcoidosis, fungal infection, tuberculosis, or lymphoma is reasonable. In this young otherwise healthy patient, pulmonary sarcoidosis causing vitamin D-dependent hypercalcemia is probable."

Additional testing can be done when the clinical diagnosis is unclear; when RAIU is unavailable or unreliable, such as in patients taking amiodarone or lithium or those recently exposed to iodinated contrast material; or when scintigraphy is contraindicated, such as in pregnancy and lactation. In the absence of RAIU, additional tests include measurement of TSI or thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb). In this patient, TSI measurement is a reasonable first test because an abnormal result has prognostic and treatment implications. Other possible causes of the patient's hyperthyroidism include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis. Because hCG stimulates thyroid hormone secretion, TSH may be mildly suppressed as a result. Serum TSH gradually returns to the nonpregnant reference range in the second and third trimester. Determining the cause of hyperthyroidism is important because transient causes of pregnancy-related hyperthyroidism, such as hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis, may not require intervention other than laboratory monitoring."

Also, the American Diabetes Association suggests that in patients with type 2 diabetes and established heart failure, an SGLT2 inhibitor may be considered to reduce the risk for heart failure-related hospitalization. Because empagliflozin is renally cleared, considerations for renal dose adjustment are required. The marked benefit in cardiac and renal protection of this drug class must be balanced against the risks of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, increased urinary tract infections, genital fungal infections, and increased rate of lower limb infection, ulceration, and amputations."

In the setting of disorders associated with malabsorption such as celiac disease or gastric bypass surgery, chronic deficiencies of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus can lead to osteomalacia, manifesting as impaired skeletal mineralization and low bone mineral density (BMD). Diffuse pain with weight bearing or palpation, especially if accompanied by fractures of ribs and bones of the pelvis and feet, are late presentations of osteomalacia. A progressive rise in total alkaline phosphatase precedes overt hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia and is an early indicator that low BMD is the result of osteomalacia rather than osteoporosis. Very low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and low urine calcium excretion could serve as corroborating evidence that this patient has osteomalacia caused by malabsorption."

The most common cause of non-tumor-related hyperprolactinemia is medication. Up to 40% of patients taking typical antipsychotics will develop hyperprolactinemia because of the dopamine antagonist effect. Although medication-induced hyperprolactinemia most often results in prolactin levels of 25 to 100 ng/mL (25-100 μg/L), drugs such as metoclopramide, risperidone, and phenothiazines can lead to prolactin levels greater than 200 ng/mL (200 μg/L). Confirmation of medication-induced hyperprolactinemia is often challenging. A pituitary-specific MRI is often necessary to ensure that an adenoma is not present. If this patient's hyperprolactinemia remains untreated, she will continue to have amenorrhea and bone loss over time because of estrogen deficiency. Estrogen-progesterone replacement therapy is necessary to avoid the sequelae of estrogen deficiency."

Although the choice of initial therapy for established postmenopausal osteoporosis always has implications for the disease course, this consideration is especially true when anabolic agents (e.g., teriparatide, abaloparatide) are used. The bone formative effect of anabolic agents rapidly declines with discontinuation of therapy whereas the increased bone resorption caused by these agents persists. Rapid loss of the newly formed bone gained during therapy ensues with discontinuation unless antiresorptive therapy, typically a bisphosphonate or denosumab, is initiated within 1 month of completing the course of anabolic treatment. Based on these limitations, discontinuation of teriparatide (",

Therefore, normalization of serum calcium is the primary goal and most frequently monitored endpoint of therapy. A reasonable goal for most patients is a serum calcium concentration at or just below the reference range without hypercalciuria. Monitoring of urine calcium excretion is mandatory because hypercalciuria often limits therapy. Correction of coexisting hypomagnesemia is also required. Thiazide diuretics are commonly used because they decrease urine calcium excretion. However, loss of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-mediated renal excretion of phosphorus may also result in hyperphosphatemia. In hypoparathyroidism management, serum phosphorus concentrations are ideally maintained in the normal range. Initial treatment of hyperphosphatemia is reduction of dietary phosphorus but occasionally requires addition of oral phosphate binders if serum phosphorus exceeds the normal range. Measurement of this patient's serum phosphorus level is an integral part of managing his hypoparathyroidism."

SGLT2 inhibitors promote renal excretion of glucose by blocking the SGLT2 receptor in the proximal tubule. Euglycemic DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use is believed to be initiated by glucosuria, which results in decreased plasma glucose levels and decreased insulin release. The resultant relative insulin deficiency may be insufficient to suppress lipolysis and ketogenesis. In addition, carbohydrate deficiency, volume depletion, and upregulation of counterregulatory stress hormones promote increased lipolysis and ketogenesis, while also maintaining euglycemia. A high level of suspicion is necessary to promptly identify DKA in these individuals, and serum ketones should be checked in those with nausea, vomiting, or malaise while taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. The presence of an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels in the setting of SGLT2 use suggests the diagnosis of DKA."

The pathogenesis of PCOS is thought to be persistent and rapid gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulses leading to an excess of luteinizing hormone and insufficient follicle-stimulating hormone secretion. This effect promotes ovarian androgen production and interferes with normal follicular development. Inherent abnormalities of ovarian and adrenal steroidogenesis are also a suspected factor in PCOS. The Endocrine Society endorsed the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS diagnosis in premenopausal women. Fulfilling two of the following three criteria support the diagnosis: oligo- and/or anovulation; clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism; and polycystic ovaries visualized on ultrasound. PCOS diagnosis is then confirmed by excluding other causes of hyperandrogenism. This patient has evidence of hyperandrogenemia (hirsutism, elevated total testosterone, elevated dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS]), ovulatory dysfunction (irregular menses since menarche), and other disorders causing hyperandrogenemia have been excluded."

Severe hyperandrogenism manifests as virilization (voice deepening, clitoromegaly, male pattern baldness, severe acne) and significantly elevated serum androgen. Total testosterone is typically greater than 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L) and DHEAS is typically greater than 700 μg/dL (7 μg/L). Mildly elevated testosterone and DHEAS can occur in PCOS. This patient demonstrates no virilizing signs, her testosterone and DHEAS levels are only mildly elevated, and her hirsutism has not been rapidly progressive, ruling out an androgen-secreting tumor and making PCOS the most likely diagnosis."

Inpatient hyperglycemia, defined as consistently elevated glucose values greater than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), is associated with poor outcomes, but attempts to achieve blood glucose targets less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is associated with hypoglycemia. The American Diabetes Association recommends that insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold of 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). After insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8-10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for most critically ill and non-critically ill patients. This recommendation is based on the findings from the NICE-SUGAR randomized clinical trial and is supported by several meta-analyses, some of which suggest that tight glycemic control (80-110 mg/dL [4.4-6.1 mmol/L]) increases mortality compared with more moderate glycemic targets and generally causes higher rates of hypoglycemia. Intravenous insulin therapy is recommended for critically ill inpatients with a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Subcutaneous insulin is appropriate for non-critically ill inpatients."

Thyroiditis is also supported by the lack of proptosis seen in Graves disease and the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Thyrotoxicosis occurs in destructive thyroiditis as a result of unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone from thyroid follicles damaged by inflammation. Thyroiditis typically has three phases: thyrotoxic, hypothyroid, and return to euthyroidism. The first two phases can last up to 3 months each. Symptomatic thyroiditis is treated with β-blockers for tachycardia and palpitations and anti-inflammatory treatments (prednisone, NSAIDs) for thyroid tenderness and pain. Most patients with thyrotoxicosis benefit from β-blockers to reduce adrenergic symptoms rapidly. Atenolol and metoprolol are preferred because of once-daily dosing and their cardioselective nature."

This interference results in a testing profile that mimics thyrotoxicosis. Biotin is a popular dietary supplement and is also used to treat multiple sclerosis and other neuromuscular disorders. Although biotin is also found in plants, the richest sources are liver, egg yolk, soybeans, and yeast. An adequate intake for adults is estimated to be 30 μg/d. Larger doses are commonly taken as an adjunctive medical treatment or for their perceived health benefits. Most case reports of biotin interference with thyroid function assays document biotin doses of 300 mg/d or higher, although interference with 10 mg/d has also been reported. Interference with thyroid assay results typically resolves within 48 hours, but expert opinion recommends testing after stopping biotin for several days."

An acute-phase response reaction characterized by low-grade fever, myalgia, and arthralgia may occur within 1 to 3 days after first administration of zoledronic acid in 30% of patients. Antipyretic agents (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) minimize the severity of symptoms, especially when given on a schedule rather than in response to symptoms. Symptoms are relatively mild and of short duration for most, but younger women and those who have never received oral bisphosphonate therapy may have more pronounced symptoms.

"). Primary hypogonadism is characterized by low testosterone with elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, indicating failure of the testes to produce testosterone. Klinefelter syndrome is the most common cause of primary hypogonadism and occurs in approximately 1 in 600 live births. Klinefelter syndrome is variable in phenotype and severity; the most severe forms are recognized before puberty, and manifestations include micropenis, clinodactyly, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. Prepubertal boys may present with behavioral abnormalities, language delay, and learning disabilities. Boys can also be diagnosed by delayed puberty, including testes growth failure, incomplete virilization, and gynecomastia. Diagnosis is often missed, however, and most diagnoses are in adulthood, with a mean age of 30 years. Adult men with Klinefelter syndrome typically present with tall stature; small, firm testes (≤4 mL); infertility (due to azoospermia); and signs of androgen deficiency, including gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, decreased muscle mass, and decreased sexual hair. The diagnosis is confirmed with karyotype analysis revealing a 47,XXY karyotype. Treatment is testosterone replacement; however, this therapy does not improve fertility. Consultation with a reproductive specialist is needed for patients who desire fertility."

Administration of iodinated contrast material may cause thyrotoxicosis in some patients with multinodular goiters. An iodine load, such as that associated with iodinated contrast media, initially decreases thyroid hormone production and release, but within 1 to 2 weeks, the effect dissipates, thus leading to thyrotoxicosis. Other sources of possible iodine exposure include medications (amiodarone) and over-the-counter preparations and supplements, including expectorants, vaginal douches, and kelp. The administration of iodinated contrast and other sources of iodine should be avoided in patients with multinodular goiters when possible to avoid precipitating iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Methimazole is an antithyroid drug that blocks further iodine uptake and synthesis of thyroid hormone; propranolol controls the heart rate. Both drugs are indicated in this patient with thyrotoxicosis."

Studies of transgender females show a significant increase in VTE with use of synthetic estrogens (ethinyl estradiol); therefore, current practice guidelines recommend only the use of estradiol preparations (oral, transdermal, or parenteral routes). This approach also facilitates monitoring the therapy because estradiol measurements are inaccurate in patients taking synthetic or conjugated estrogens. Avoiding supraphysiologic doses of estrogen and maintaining serum estradiol levels between 100 and 200 pg/mL (367-734 pmol/L) is recommended to reduce the risk for VTE. Assessment for VTE risk should be performed before starting estrogen therapy. Transgender patients who seek feminizing hormone therapy, particularly those at high risk, should be counseled on this potential adverse outcome of estrogen therapy. Smoking cessation should be encouraged before initiating therapy. Family or personal history of VTE may be a contraindication to estrogen therapy."

"). The term “ketosis-prone diabetes” incorporates several glycemic syndromes and is also known as ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes mellitus, “Flatbush diabetes,” idiopathic type 1 diabetes, type 1B diabetes, and atypical diabetes. These syndromes present with episodic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resulting from insulin deficiency but have variable periods of insulin dependence and independence. For individuals with ketosis-prone diabetes, insulin therapy for DKA is required until DKA has resolved and the β cells are no longer impaired by glucose toxicity and can produce sufficient amounts of insulin to suppress lipolysis. Assessment of β-cell reserve with a fasting C-peptide level should be performed weeks to months after the episode of DKA; β-cell function is indicated by a C-peptide concentration of at least 1 ng/mL (0.33 nmol/L). Patients should also be evaluated for type 1 diabetes with fasting C-peptide measurement or a glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies test. This patient has the clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetes (insulin production, obesity, strong family history), intact β-cell function, negative antibodies, and is on relatively low doses of insulin for her body weight. The insulin may be discontinued, and she can start metformin."

"). A pituitary lesion discovered incidentally on imaging is termed a “pituitary incidentaloma.” Small, incidentally noted pituitary lesions are common. In patients undergoing MRI for nonpituitary reasons, microadenomas are found in 10% to 38% of cases whereas incidental macroadenomas are seen in 0.2%. Most pituitary incidentalomas are benign nonfunctional adenomas. Pituitary hypersecretion should be ruled out by measurement of prolactin and insulin-like growth factor 1. Evaluation for Cushing disease is unnecessary in patients without signs or symptoms of cortisol excess. Pituitary tumors can also cause hypopituitarism. Screening for hypopituitarism is recommended in all patients with pituitary tumors, regardless of symptoms, with measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and total testosterone in men. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be assessed in premenopausal women through menstrual history. A history of normal menses essentially rules out hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and the need to measure FSH and LH."

Obesity lowers sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and leads to a falsely low total testosterone level (which measures free plus protein-bound testosterone); the free testosterone concentration remains normal. Measurement of free testosterone in a laboratory capable of performing the equilibrium dialysis assay is recommended to distinguish between a suspected binding abnormality and hypogonadism in a man with obesity. The binding abnormality caused by obesity is proportional to the degree of obesity. If free testosterone is low, a serum luteinizing hormone (LH) measurement is indicated. An elevated LH level and low free testosterone reflects primary hypogonadism (testicular failure), and further evaluation should be directed toward identifying the cause. A low or normal LH level with simultaneous low free testosterone reflects secondary hypogonadism (hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction). Several other causes of abnormal SHBG levels should also be considered in evaluation for hypogonadism. Increased SHBG levels may be associated with aging, hyperthyroidism, high estrogen concentrations, liver disease, HIV infection, and antiseizure drugs. In addition to obesity, reduced SHBG levels may be associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, growth hormone excess, exogenous androgens or anabolic steroids, glucocorticoids, progestins, and nephrotic syndrome."

Hypophysitis occurs in 0.5% to 17% of patients and often presents with headache and fatigue. Hypophysitis is more common in patients managed with anti-CTL-4 antibodies or combination therapy (anti-CTL-4 plus anti-PD-1 antibodies), in men, and in older patients. Although endocrine evaluation usually reveals adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency, as well as low levels of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency is the most immediate concern because cortisol deficiency can be life-threatening. Imaging demonstrates enhancement or enlargement of the pituitary gland with thickening of the pituitary stalk. Diabetes insipidus is uncommon. Treatment includes replacement of the hormone deficiencies and high-dose glucocorticoids in severe cases to treat the inflammatory process, although hormone deficiencies often persist. It is important to replace cortisol before initiation of thyroid hormone to avoid precipitating an adrenal crisis."

Causes include medications, alcohol, kidney or liver dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and, rarely, pancreatogenous insulinoma or noninsulinoma (endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia that is not caused by an insulinoma). If the hypoglycemia occurs while fasting, a prolonged fast, up to 72 hours, should be initiated. Plasma glucose should be drawn every 6 hours and sent to the laboratory immediately. If the level is less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L), four tests should be sent: C-peptide, insulin, proinsulin, and β-hydroxybutyrate. Insulin antibodies and an oral hypoglycemic agent screen should also be measured at the beginning of the fast. Blood sample collection should increase to every 1 to 2 hours when the glucose measurement is less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Testing is complete when one of the following two sets of parameters is met: plasma glucose 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) or less with neuroglycopenia (neurologic symptoms, most commonly confusion), or plasma glucose less than 55 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) with previously documented Whipple triad, defined as plasma glucose less than 55 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L), neuroglycopenic symptoms, and resolution of symptoms with glucose ingestion. Point-of-care glucose values and hyperadrenergic symptoms (palpitations, diaphoresis, headache, tremor, pallor) should not be used to determine the end of the fast. Blood samples should be collected again at the end of the 72-hour period if none of the complete testing criteria has been met."

Thyrotoxicosis affects 5% of patients treated with amiodarone. Type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) (hyperthyroidism) occurs in patients with Graves disease or thyroid nodules. This form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon) is typically treated with methimazole. Type 2 AIT (destructive thyroiditis) is more common and occurs in patients without underlying thyroid disease. Type 2 AIT is usually self-limiting but sometimes requires treatment with glucocorticoids. Thyroid ultrasonography with Doppler studies, in addition to identifying thyroid nodules, allows assessment of the gland vascularity. Increased vascularity suggests type 1 AIT as the cause, whereas decreased vascularity suggests type 2 AIT. The decision to discontinue amiodarone depends on the patient's cardiac condition and type of thyrotoxicosis and should be done in consultation with a cardiologist."

Complications include macrosomia, labor and delivery complications, preeclampsia, neonatal hypoglycemia, spontaneous abortion, and intrauterine fetal demise. Many women with gestational diabetes are able to meet glycemic targets with a low–glycemic-index diet and reduced carbohydrate intake. However, when the glycemic targets of less than 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L) fasting and less than 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) 2 hours after a meal are not achieved with therapeutic lifestyle modifications, medical therapy should be initiated to improve perinatal outcomes. Insulin is the preferred therapy in gestational diabetes because it does not cross the placenta to the same degree as other medications. Basal insulin (insulin detemir or neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] based on their established safety in pregnancy) should be used to treat fasting hyperglycemia, whereas rapid-acting insulins, such as insulin aspart or insulin lispro, are best to treat postprandial glycemic excursions."

Given that this patient has primary adrenal insufficiency, she requires both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy. The preferred glucocorticoid for treatment of adrenal insufficiency is hydrocortisone two or three times daily to better mimic the circadian rhythm of endogenous cortisol secretion. The higher dose of hydrocortisone is given in the morning (typically 10-15 mg), and the lower dose is given in the afternoon (approximately 5 mg)."

The optimum duration of denosumab use is unknown; notably, however, fracture rates are comparable over 10 years to those treated for 3 years in clinical trials, suggesting continued benefit for up to 10 years if denosumab therapy is followed by an alternative antiresorptive therapy."

MACE is a condition characterized by ACTH-independent cortisol secretion that may result in metabolic (hyperglycemia and hypertension) and bone (osteoporosis) effects of hypercortisolism, but not the more specific features of Cushing syndrome (centripetal obesity, facial plethora, abnormal fat deposition, and wide violaceous striae). The preferred diagnostic test for MACE is a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test; a morning cortisol level greater than 5 μg/dL (138 nmol/L) is considered positive.

This patient has a normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, so measurement of urine calcium excretion is the next diagnostic step. The initial response to a decline in serum calcium is an increase in parathyroid hormone level (PTH) secretion, which decreases renal calcium excretion and increases calcium resorption from the bones. Continued PTH-mediated mobilization of calcium from bone over months to years in response to chronic negative calcium balance can lead to metabolic bone disease. In this patient who has sufficient vitamin D, low urine calcium excretion will confirm inadequate intake and/or absorption of calcium and explain her low bone mass."

"), which is approved as initial therapy for neuropathic pain. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (distal symmetric polyneuropathy) typically has an ascending presentation with a “stocking and glove” distribution. It may involve damage to both small and large nerve fibers. Symptoms from small nerve fiber damage include pain, burning, and tingling. Small nerve fiber abnormalities can be detected by assessment of monofilament or pinprick testing and temperature sensations. The treatment goal of diabetic neuropathy is symptom control. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends pregabalin, gabapentin, or duloxetine as initial therapy for neuropathic pain. Head-to-head comparative studies and studies with quality-of-life outcomes are limited, so drug selection must consider the patient's comorbidities, previous treatments, and likelihood of adherence. Pregabalin is the most extensively studied drug for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and most studies reported a 30% to 50% improvement in pain; however, not all trials demonstrated positive results. Gabapentin, a related drug, has also shown efficacy in clinical trials, and is less expensive than pregabalin, but it is not FDA approved for treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy. The selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor duloxetine has also shown efficacy and, in some studies, improved quality of life; however, adverse effects may limit adherence."

After insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8-10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for most critically ill and non-critically ill patients. Basal insulin is long-acting insulin given once daily; prandial insulin is scheduled short-acting insulin given three times daily with each meal; and correctional insulin is dosing in response to continued elevated glucose rather than preemptively. A correctional dose of short-acting insulin should be given in addition to the scheduled prandial insulin to correct for hyperglycemia before eating. This approach leads to improved outcomes and avoids large fluctuations in glucose values through the day. A randomized controlled trial has shown that basal-prandial insulin treatment improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications compared with use of only correctional insulin (“sliding scale insulin”) regimens in general surgery patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

"). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. PCOS affects 6% to 10% of women and is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility in women. It is associated with rapid gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulses, an excess of luteinizing hormone, and insufficient follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, resulting in excessive ovarian androgen production and ovulatory dysfunction. PCOS is accompanied by insulin resistance. Elevated insulin levels in PCOS further enhance ovarian and adrenal androgen production, as well as increase bioavailability of androgens related to a reduction in sex hormone-binding globulin. PCOS is associated with increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. This patient with PCOS has evidence of ongoing hirsutism (i.e., dark coarse hair on the face, chest, back, arms/legs) and acne despite 6 months of oral contraceptive therapy. The next step is to add an antiandrogen agent to oral contraceptive therapy. Spironolactone is the most commonly used antiandrogen agent and is generally safe and well tolerated. Potential adverse effects include hyperkalemia (rare in patients with normal renal function), gastrointestinal discomfort, and irregular menstrual bleeding. In women prescribed spironolactone, concomitant contraception is mandatory because of teratogenesis in male fetuses."

FHA is a cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and often presents with amenorrhea in the setting of excess exercise/energy expenditure or decreased caloric intake. FHA is caused by disruption of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, which leads to decreased gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) levels. This decrease prevents normal follicular development and causes anovulation and low estradiol levels. The diagnosis of FHA is based on low serum gonadotropin and estradiol levels in addition to amenorrhea in the setting of extreme exercise, weight loss, or stress. FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, it is important to rule out other causes of secondary amenorrhea, such as pregnancy, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, and primary ovarian insufficiency. If hyperandrogenism (e.g., hirsutism, virilization) is evident, evaluation for an androgen-producing tumor, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercortisolism, and polycystic ovary syndrome should be pursued. Treatment for FHA centers on reducing the stressors that led to gonadotropin-releasing hormone disruption, such as extreme exercise, severe calorie restriction, or low body weight. The first step in management is increased caloric intake to match energy expenditure and to reduce exercise. Other effective interventions are stress reduction and behavioral therapy."

Glucosuria in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) causes an osmotic diuresis and severe volume depletion, which may progress to lethargy, obtundation, and death if the hyperglycemia, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities are not treated aggressively and early. Aggressive intravenous volume replacement with 0.9% saline is indicated. Electrolyte deficits, such as potassium, should be replaced, and hyperglycemia should be corrected with intravenous insulin. In DKA, total body potassium levels are depleted because of shifts from the intracellular to extracellular space caused by the ketoacidosis and insufficient insulin. Potassium urinary losses are generated by the glucose osmotic diuresis and result in potassium depletion. Normal or low serum potassium levels indicate a depletion of body stores and require supplementation before insulin therapy is initiated."

"). Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after 1 year of consistent and unprotected intercourse, and an evaluation for underlying causes of infertility is recommended. However, an evaluation after 6 months in a woman older than 35 years is reasonable. Ovulatory disorders are the most common cause of female infertility, so the first step in evaluation is to obtain a midluteal phase serum progesterone level, which is the best test to assess ovulatory function. The test is performed 1 week before expected menses, and a level greater than 3 ng/mL (9.5 nmol/L) is evidence of recent ovulation. If a midluteal phase progesterone is normal, further evaluation is needed for tubal patency and uterine abnormalities. Hysterosalpingography is used to assess for tubal occlusion and to evaluate the uterine cavity."

Common indications to initiate testing for pheochromocytoma include adrenergic-type spells (headache, sweating, tachycardia) with or without hypertension, resistant hypertension, onset of hypertension at a young age, and idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Other indications include familial syndromes that predispose to pheochromocytoma (e.g., multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2), or a family history of pheochromocytoma. Initial tests for pheochromocytoma include measurement of plasma free metanephrine collected with the patient in a supine position or 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrine and catecholamine levels. Elevation in catecholamines can occur in patients under psychological or physical stress. Certain medications can affect results and should be discontinued at least 2 weeks before testing. Mild elevations may require repeat testing. Levels more than four times the upper limit of normal, in absence of acute stress or illness, are consistent with a catecholamine-secreting tumor. The plasma free metanephrine test is highly sensitive (96%-100%). The specificity is 85% to 89%. Urine fractionated metanephrine and catecholamines have higher specificity (98%) and high sensitivity (up to 97%). Neither test is superior, so clinicians can use an estimate of pretest probability to select the initial test. In context of a high index of suspicion, plasma free metanephrine is chosen whereas urine fractionated metanephrine and catecholamines may be a better option for cases with low suspicion."

Acromegaly is caused by excess growth hormone (GH) secretion from a pituitary tumor in 95% of patients. Fewer than 5% of patients with GH excess have a GH-releasing hormone-secreting tumor or neuroendocrine tumor. When GH-secreting pituitary tumors occur in children before puberty, the result is increased longitudinal growth, resulting in gigantism. Although gigantism is easily recognized in children, features of excess GH (acromegaly) are more subtle in adults and may not be recognized for years. Because IGF-1 is produced in the liver in response to GH stimulation, obtaining an IGF-1 level is the most appropriate method to evaluate for acromegaly and it is the best screening biomarker for acromegaly because it is more stable than GH level. IGF-1 levels are normalized for age and sex, and aging lowers the normal range of IGF-1."

Primary aldosteronism caused by hyperplasia of both adrenal glands (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism) is the most likely diagnosis. Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism causes approximately 60% of cases of primary aldosteronism; a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) is found in approximately 35% of cases. Medical therapy with an aldosterone receptor blocker, spironolactone or eplerenone, is the treatment of choice for idiopathic aldosteronism, or when patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma are not candidates for or do not wish to undergo surgery. Spironolactone is often preferred over eplerenone because it is less expensive and has more potent aldosterone-blocking properties. However, patients on spironolactone are more likely to develop dose-dependent adverse effects, including gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction in men and menstrual irregularities in women."

Therefore, treating the hypertension with lisinopril without addressing the underlying hyperaldosteronism with an aldosterone receptor blocker would subject this patient to the deleterious effects of excess stimulation of aldosterone receptors."

In patients without cardiovascular disease or at high risk for cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, the choice of a second or third agent to add to metformin is not evidence-based. Instead, drug choice is based on avoidance of adverse effects, particularly hypoglycemia and weight gain, cost, and patient preferences. Treatment regimens must be continuously reviewed for efficacy, adverse effects, and patient burden.
