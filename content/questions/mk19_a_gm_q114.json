She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications."

This patient has symptoms and examination findings suggesting vertigo arising from a peripheral cause, including unidirectional nystagmus with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and catch-up saccades with head impulse testing. Labyrinthitis is caused by postviral inflammation of both branches of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), resulting in sudden-onset, severe, persistent vertigo and hearing loss. This patient's symptoms and her recent viral upper respiratory tract infection are consistent with the diagnosis of labyrinthitis. Labyrinthitis is usually treated with prednisone."

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is usually seen in young immunosuppressed persons (such as those with AIDS) or in adults older than 50 years."
