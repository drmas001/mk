"). ILD is common among patients with connective tissue disease and can occasionally be the first manifestation. In this patient, systemic sclerosis is suggested by the presence of Raynaud phenomenon, gastroesophageal reflux disease, “puffy fingers” (a finding of early skin disease), and positive antitopoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) antibody. A patulous esophagus can be seen on the chest CT scan. Radiographic findings mirror those of other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, with the nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern characterized by ground-glass opacities with predominance at the base of the lungs seen in this patient. This radiographic pattern is present in more than 80% of persons with systemic sclerosis–associated ILD. In patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease, the presence of an underlying connective tissue disease has prognostic and therapeutic implications. In contrast to idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, patients with connective tissue disease–associated ILD are treated with immunomodulatory medications and tend to have a more favorable prognosis."

However, this patient's chest radiographic findings, lack of environmental exposures, and findings of systemic sclerosis make the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis unlikely."
