"). BE is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease in which the normal squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by specialized columnar epithelium. Patients with BE have more severe esophageal acid reflux than those with nonerosive reflux disease. BE is a premalignant condition; patients have an estimated 30- to 50-fold increased risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma compared with those without BE, with an annual incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma of 0.5%. Patients without dysplasia have very low risk for progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Due to high interpersonal variability in staging BE, the diagnosis should be made by a pathologist with expertise in esophageal disease. In patients without dysplasia, surveillance upper endoscopy every 3 to 5 years is recommended. Patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia are candidates for ablation therapy, but endoscopic surveillance, as initially chosen for this patient, is an accepted alternative. Patients with high-grade dysplasia should undergo treatment to eradicate all neoplastic and at-risk epithelium. Endoscopic therapy for BE includes mucosal resection as well as ablation, of which radiofrequency is the best studied. Ablation has a high rate of eradication of both metaplasia and dysplasia. Because BE has a high tendency to recur, continuation of treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole, and posttreatment surveillance are essential."

The diagnostic criteria for EoE are esophageal symptoms (dysphagia), esophageal biopsy specimens showing persistent eosinophil counts of 15/hpf or greater, and exclusion of other causes of eosinophilia. If assessment identifies no other causes of eosinophilia, EoE can be diagnosed and appropriate therapy initiated with a proton pump inhibitor and/or swallowed topical glucocorticoids (fluticasone or budesonide).
