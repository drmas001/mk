"A 71-year-old man is evaluated for a 6-month history of exertional chest pain. The pain has increased in frequency and now occurs earlier during his exercise regimen. The pain is relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 4 years ago. History is also significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications are metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and aspirin."

Although this patient can exercise, the presence of LBBB limits interpretation for heart rateâ€“dependent stress modalities."

Other scenarios in which dobutamine echocardiography is not an optimal stress option include resting wall motion abnormalities and contraindications to using dobutamine. Contraindications to dobutamine stress echocardiography include acute coronary syndromes; severe aortic stenosis; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; and uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias, or heart failure. Dobutamine echocardiography is recommended in patients who cannot exercise or when information on an area of myocardium at risk is needed."

") is not the most appropriate stress modality for this patient because of the presence of LBBB. Imaging modalities that require heart rate increases, such as exercise, are not recommended for patients with LBBB because the abnormal septal wall motion may limit interpretation. With the exception of LBBB, exercise single-photon emission CT is recommended when baseline ECG findings are abnormal or when information on a particular area of myocardium at risk is needed. With LBBB, conduction delay in the septum may cause false-positive abnormalities; vasodilator stress can improve the accuracy of perfusion imaging."
