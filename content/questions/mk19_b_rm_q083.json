"). No single radiographic feature is diagnostic of rheumatoid arthritis. However, features such as periarticular osteopenia, joint-space narrowing, and bony erosions are characteristic of established disease and may help solidify the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis when physical examination findings are equivocal. If present, they can also underscore the need for early treatment with disease-modifying agents, which can include biologics, because the presence of radiographic damage at the time of diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis predicts a more severe course of disease. Thus, plain radiography may aid in both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making as well as help establish a baseline to assist in monitoring disease activity."

ANCA testing is usually performed to help diagnose or exclude granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. However, polyarticular, symmetric inflammatory arthritis of the small joints of the hands as seen in this patient is not a feature of ANCA-positive vasculitis. The choice of which autoantibody tests to order should be guided by an accurate history and careful physical examination. In this case, ANCA testing is not the most appropriate diagnostic test."
