"). This patient probably has urge incontinence, or overactive bladder with incontinence. Urge incontinence is urine leakage preceded by a sudden urge to void. First-line therapy for any urinary incontinence is behavioral training. For urge incontinence, behavioral training consists of bladder training with timed voiding. Bladder training comprises scheduled voiding attempts at intervals shorter than the usual time between incontinence episodes, regardless of the urge to void, with a gradual increase in the time between voids. If an episode of urgency occurs before the designated voiding time, patients are encouraged to use pelvic floor muscle contraction until the urge passes and then proceed with voiding directly afterward."

") is a type of behavioral therapy in which the patient performs sets of contractions of the pelvic floor. Pelvic floor muscle training is five times more effective than no treatment for stress incontinence. Patients should be instructed to contract the pelvic floor as if attempting to avoid urination and sustain the contraction for 10 seconds. Contractions should be performed in three or four sets of 10 daily. Pelvic floor exercises are appropriate for stress incontinence and mixed stress and urge incontinence but will not be helpful for this patient who has only urge incontinence."
