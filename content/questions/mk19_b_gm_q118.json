"). Vaginitis describes conditions associated with vulvovaginal symptoms that may include vaginal discharge, burning, itching, or odor. Vaginal discharge can be physiologic, related to ovulation or pregnancy, or infectious, most commonly bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, or trichomoniasis. Other causes of vaginal discharge include irritation from use of douches, atrophic vaginitis, malignancy, or a foreign body. Physical examination includes assessment of the vulva and vagina for erythema, edema, excoriation, papillomas, and the type of discharge. However, clinical findings do not sufficiently distinguish among the common causes of vaginitis, and laboratory testing is necessary to establish a diagnosis. Diagnostic testing includes assessment of vaginal pH; amine (whiff) test; and microscopic evaluation of the specimen to look for clue cells on the wet mount and yeast, hyphae, and pseudohyphae on the KOH preparation. Occasionally, motile trichomonads can be visualized on a wet preparation, suggesting trichomoniasis; in these cases, antigen testing is recommended because it can be difficult to diagnose trichomoniasis on microscopy alone. If microscopy is unavailable, nucleic acid amplification testing for the common pathogens can assist with the diagnosis."

") is appropriate treatment for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, although the dose and duration differ. Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed using the Amsel criteria, which requires presence of three of the following four criteria: vaginal pH greater than 4.5; thin, homogenous vaginal discharge; positive whiff test, and at least 20% clue cells on saline wet mount. Patients with trichomoniasis typically present with increased discolored vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, itching, and postcoital bleeding. The diagnosis of trichomoniasis is most secure after a positive saline wet mount and nucleic acid amplification test."
