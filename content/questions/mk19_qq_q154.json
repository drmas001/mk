"). High breast density is common, occurring in up to 50% of women. Women with high breast density have an increased risk for breast cancer (relative risk of 1.2 for heterogeneously dense breast tissue, relative risk of 2.1 for extremely dense breast tissue) but not breast cancerâ€“related mortality. High breast density also decreases the sensitivity of film mammography to detect small lesions. Digital mammography has an increased sensitivity for detecting small lesions in dense breasts compared with film mammography; it is therefore the preferred modality for routine screening, if available."

"), also known as 3-D mammography, uses a moving x-ray source and a digital detector to capture breast images at different angles. A computer algorithm reconstructs the two-dimensional images into a three-dimensional image of the breast. Digital breast tomosynthesis exposes the patient to twice as much radiation as conventional mammography. There are no clinical studies comparing standard mammography to digital breast tomosynthesis, and it is not considered the standard of care for average-risk women with dense breasts."

No prospective trials of breast ultrasonography as a primary screening modality currently exist, and the role of ultrasonography as a supplemental test to mammography has not been clearly defined. It is therefore not recommended as a replacement for digital mammography."
