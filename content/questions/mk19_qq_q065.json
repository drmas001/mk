"). The increased femoral cortical width on the previous plain radiograph is a characteristic finding in patients who later have atypical femoral fractures. This complication is believed to occur as a result of a reduction in bone turnover and, therefore, bone repair after prolonged treatment with bisphosphonates. The abnormal bone is fragile and prone to fracture. A large, prospective cohort study identified risk factors for bisphosphonate-related atypical fractures: duration of bisphosphonate therapy greater than 3 to 5 years, older age, chronic glucocorticoid use, shorter height, and higher weight. In this group, the risk for an atypical fracture was decreased with discontinuation of bisphosphonates. In one large study, the number needed to harm during a 3-year period in order to encounter one case of atypical femoral fracture was 417, whereas the number needed to prevent a single vertebral fracture was 14 and to prevent a hip fracture was 91. Simply stated, for every atypical femoral fracture encountered, 30 vertebral fractures and five hip fractures were prevented. Although this analysis favors the use of bisphosphonates in appropriate patients, it also underscores the need for discretion in the selection of patients and supports consideration of a drug holiday in stable improved patients after 5 years of continuous bisphosphonate use."

Groin pain suggests lesser trochanteric and is worse with hip flexion and rotation. Pain over the greater trochanter suggests greater trochanteric fracture which increases with abduction and tenderness over the greater trochanter. The patient's age and findings are not consistent with trochanteric fracture."
