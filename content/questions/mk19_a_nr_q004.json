"A 27-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department after three episodes of loss of consciousness and falling down that started 2 weeks ago. He has no memory of the events. The third event was witnessed by a coworker who noted that the patient cried out, had whole-body stiffening, and fell backward off his chair. While on the ground, the patient's whole body shook with synchronous limb jerking for 2 minutes. Afterward, the patient was very sleepy and had slow, snoring-like breathing. He remained in a state of impaired alertness for 8 minutes. He gradually awoke by the time he reached the emergency department 20 minutes later, and now has recovered to normal."

Although this patient's first two seizures were unwitnessed, the third event was characterized by an ictal cry, whole-body stiffening and falling down, rhythmic synchronous limb jerking, and subsequent postictal lethargy and stertorous respirations (slow, deep, snoring-like breathing due to upper airway obstruction); these features characterize a GTCS."

Convulsive status epilepticus is diagnosed clinically. This patient's clonic activity lasted 2 minutes with an 8-minute postictal period of impaired alertness and does not meet the definition of generalized convulsive status epilepticus. The postictal period of confusion and impaired alertness is not accounted for as part of seizure duration, although the layperson may inadvertently include it when interviewed about the event."

") may be considered in the differential diagnosis. PNES are most often related to posttraumatic stress disorder or conversion disorder. Patients often have a history of military combat, sexual or physical abuse, chronic medical illness, or prominent life stressors. PNES often mimic GTCS, but certain features help distinguish the diagnoses. PNES findings may include asynchronous flailing of variable limbs, side-to-side head shaking, pelvic thrusting, and prolonged duration (>5 minutes or even hours). Event capture during video EEG monitoring usually is required to confirm the diagnosis. GTCS are a better fit for this patient's symptoms."
