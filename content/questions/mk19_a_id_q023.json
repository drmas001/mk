"). Although a tuberculin skin test has not been performed and the final sputum culture is pending, the patient has a significant personal history that increases her risk of tuberculosis; she works in a high-risk setting (prison). She has several key symptoms and signs of pulmonary tuberculosis, including weight loss, fever, night sweats, productive cough, malaise, and fatigue; the chest radiograph is compatible with active tuberculosis, and she has a classic sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain. When a sputum smear result is positive for AFB, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is highly recommended to verify the organism. The positive predictive value of a NAAT on a smear-positive sputum sample is 95%. When active tuberculosis is verified, in vitro susceptibility testing of the initial isolate should be done for the first-line agents (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) which should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent further disease progression and transmission."
