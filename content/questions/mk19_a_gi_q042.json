She has obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She underwent sleeve gastrectomy 4 months ago. Current medications are omeprazole, promethazine, metformin, and lisinopril."

"). This patient most likely has dumping syndrome as a consequence of her sleeve gastrectomy. Dumping syndrome can follow a variety of surgical procedures, including vagotomy, pyloroplasty, Roux-en-Y bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and esophagectomy. Early dumping syndrome, as in this patient, results from the rapid transition of food into the small intestine, causing a fluid shift and potential release of gastrointestinal hormones with vasoactive properties. Classic gastrointestinal symptoms can include abdominal pain, epigastric fullness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, borborygmi, and bloating. Classic vasomotor symptoms can include palpitations and tachycardia, faintness or syncope, diaphoresis, and flushing and pallor. Symptoms typically occur within 1 hour of eating. Treatment should be tiered, beginning with dietary modifications and patient education by a trained dietitian. Dietary interventions can include the pursuit of smaller and more frequent meals (at least six per day); delayed intake of fluids by at least 30 minutes after intake of solids; avoidance of rapidly absorbable carbohydrates and alcohol; increased intake of high-fiber, high-protein foods; and lying down after a meal for 30 minutes. The use of dietary supplements, such as guar gum or pectin, to increase food viscosity can also be helpful."
