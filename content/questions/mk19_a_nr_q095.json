The highest risk of stroke after a TIA or minor stroke is associated with symptomatic large artery atherosclerosis in patients with extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis. These patients benefit from urgent carotid revascularization to prevent a subsequent stroke. Carotid ultrasonography is a low-cost, readily available test not associated with radiation and should be performed emergently in order to identify patients who may require surgery."

") is an expensive test and may not immediately change management. Intracranial atherosclerosis is associated with a high risk of stroke after a TIA and minor stroke, and the indicated treatment for stroke prevention is best medical therapy. Intracranial stenting is high risk without a significant reduction in stroke. MRI of the brain also will not result in an immediate change in management and is high cost. The latest American Heart Association guidelines do not recommend routine use of MRI in the inpatient setting; an infarct present on MRI will not change recommendations on initiation of antithrombotic treatment or necessarily inform risk of stroke better than the less expensive carotid imaging. After the initial diagnostic testing, an MRI may allow for further stroke subtyping and confirm the diagnosis of minor stroke."

TTE also is not routinely indicated in patients with stroke unless there is a clinical suspicion of a cardioembolic stroke based on medical history or examination findings."
