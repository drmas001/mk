"). This patient has signs of skin atrophy, telangiectasias, and striae caused by overuse of clobetasol cream, a high-potency topical glucocorticoid. Side effects are most frequently seen when higher potencies are used for longer periods or when used under occlusion, and they can appear as soon as 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Use of glucocorticoids around the eyes can exacerbate glaucoma and cause cataracts. Skin atrophy is more likely to occur in intertriginous areas, the face, and often in the popliteal or antecubital fossa. Topical glucocorticoids may also cause easy bruising. Although this patient has signs of skin atrophy, she continues to have flares of her atopic dermatitis requiring treatment. Topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are immunomodulators (calcineurin inhibitors) that can be effective in treating atopic dermatitis, having similar efficacy to low- to medium-potency glucocorticoids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors can be used on the face and intertriginous areas without the risk for skin atrophy, telangiectasias, and striae that can occur with topical glucocorticoid use. The most common side effect of topical calcineurin inhibitors is stinging or burning after application. Both drugs have been associated with an increased risk for viral skin infections, such as herpes simplex and varicella zoster. These medications have a black box warning for the rare development of skin cancer and cutaneous lymphoma. Replacing clobetasol cream with tacrolimus ointment is the most appropriate choice to continue to treat this patient's atopic dermatitis in the setting of glucocorticoid atrophy."

") is a mid-potency topical glucocorticoid. Although it is effective in treating atopic dermatitis and is less potent than clobetasol cream, it can potentially exacerbate the current atrophy, striae, and telangiectasias seen in this patient's skin. Topical glucocorticoids are frequently commercially combined with topical antifungal agents (clotrimazole-betamethasone). These combinations should also be avoided. The use of a combination drug can worsen some tinea infections and when used in the groin area has a high risk for causing striae."
