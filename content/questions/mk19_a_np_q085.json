Of the nephrotic states, RVT appears more commonly with membranous nephropathy (MN) than with other pathologies. Hematuria and flank pain are suggestive in this patient, although RVT can be asymptomatic. The gold standard diagnostic test for RVT is selective renal venography. However, less invasive procedures are more typically used. In this patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) (or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <30 mL/min/1.73 m",
