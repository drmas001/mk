") to avoid an adrenal crisis. Patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy may be at risk for secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) and perioperative adrenal crisis. Historically, increased glucocorticoid doses (stress dosing) were administered liberally in the perioperative period to mimic the natural response of the adrenal glands to physiologic stress. However, studies have shown that stress dosing may not be required in many patients receiving low-dose and short-course glucocorticoid therapy. When managing a patient with glucocorticoid exposure within the past year, considerations include the type of surgery (low, intermediate, or high risk) and the dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy. Patients on high doses of glucocorticoids for extended periods (equivalent of >20 mg/d prednisone for >3 weeks) are at high risk for AI and should receive stress dosing when undergoing intermediate- to high-risk surgery. These patients may not need glucocorticoid support for a low-risk procedure, such as cataract surgery. Patients at low risk for AI (those taking low doses of glucocorticoids for shorter periods) can generally proceed to surgery of any risk level without stress-dose glucocorticoids. Patients at moderate risk for AI may require testing to assess for the presence of adrenal insufficiency before determining best perioperative management, although newer guidelines suggest treating empirically with stress-dose glucocorticoids for a large proportion of this intermediate-risk group. This patient is at moderate risk for AI because she received more than 5 mg/d of prednisone during the past year; previously required supplemental glucocorticoids during another major operation; and is undergoing total knee arthroplasty, which is an intermediate-risk procedure. Continuing her baseline glucocorticoids alone (",
