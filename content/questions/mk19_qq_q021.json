In general, the ABCDEs of identifying characteristics can help diagnose melanoma, where “A” stands for Asymmetry, “B” for irregular Border, “C” for multiple Colors, “D” for Diameter greater than 6 mm, and “E” for Evolution or change over time. There are four clinical subtypes of melanoma: superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, acral lentiginous, and nodular melanoma. Risk factors include ultraviolet light (both chronic and intermittent blistering sunburns), genetics (family history, and ",

" gene mutations), large number of nevi, dysplastic nevi, and fair skin. Nodular melanomas typically present as uniformly dark blue or black \"berry-like\" lesions that most commonly originate from normal skin but may also arise as amelanotic lesions with a pink hue, making diagnosis difficult. This patient has a small back nodule and a large, mainly pink nodule with some melanotic pigmentation, making the diagnosis easier. Nodular melanomas can also arise from preexisting nevi. All suspicious pigmented lesions must be biopsied. The preferred method to biopsy a pigmented lesion is an excisional biopsy with a 1- to 2-mm margin to obtain the entire lesion and to prevent sampling error. Poor prognostic factors include male gender, increasing age, increased tumor thickness (Breslow depth), ulceration, increased tumor mitotic rate, and head/neck/trunk locations."

It has a prolonged radial growth phase and can be present for many years before developing invasive, malignant vertical growth. After invasion, lentigo maligna is called lentigo maligna melanoma and is distinguishable from benign processes by positive ABCDE criteria."
