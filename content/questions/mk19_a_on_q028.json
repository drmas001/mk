"). Metastasectomy can be the optimal therapy in appropriately selected patients with solitary or oligometastatic metastases in a variety of malignancies (mostly commonly melanoma, renal cell cancer, colorectal cancer, and sarcomas). Metastatic melanoma can be cured in some cases with metastasectomy. Melanoma may be more likely than some other more common cancers to manifest solitary or oligometastatic disease. The lung is the most common site of visceral metastasis for melanoma, although it has the potential to go anywhere and is more likely than other tumors to involve unusual sites such as the heart and small bowel. Although patients with fully resected metastatic melanoma are prone to develop other sites of disease, some do not. In some cases, repeated excisions of solitary metastases can lead to long-term remission. Solitary pulmonary metastases could also be addressed in some cases by radiosurgery or percutaneous radiofrequency. Positive prognostic factors for patients undergoing metastasectomy include longer disease-free intervals, fewer than three pulmonary nodules, the absence of extrathoracic and lymph node metastases, and a response to chemotherapy or immunotherapy."
