Mucormycosis has five major clinical forms: (1) rhinocerebral; (2) pulmonary; (3) abdominal, pelvic, gastric, and gastrointestinal; (4) primary cutaneous; and (5) disseminated. This patient has rhinocerebral mucormycosis. This is a rapidly fatal infection that spreads from the sinuses retro-orbitally to the central nervous system. Mucormycosis is diagnosed by tissue biopsy and culture. Treatment requires emergent surgical debridement in addition to antifungals."
