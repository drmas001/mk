") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. The patient has symptoms of refractory heart failure despite efforts at diuresis and rhythm control. The features of preserved systolic function, significant biatrial dilatation, and pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram support the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Survival is poor in patients with RCM, with a 5-year mortality rate of 36% and a 10-year mortality rate of 63%. Cardiovascular mortality is predominantly related to progressive heart failure and arrhythmias. Mortality rates increase with male sex, severity of left atrial dilatation, age older than 70 years, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. The patient should be referred to an advanced heart failure and transplantation specialist for evaluation for possible cardiac transplantation. Heart transplantation may be limited by pulmonary hypertension."
