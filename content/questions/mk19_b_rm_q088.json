"). In some very stable patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mycophenolate mofetil could be discontinued with maintenance on hydroxychloroquine alone. SLE is associated with increased risk for miscarriage, premature delivery, and other pregnancy complications. Patients with SLE who desire pregnancy should be advised to wait until disease has been well controlled for at least 6 months to reduce these risks. Certain therapies, such as mycophenolate mofetil, belimumab, and methotrexate, should be avoided in patients considering pregnancy because they are teratogenic. Cyclophosphamide is associated with age- and dose-dependent infertility and should not be used in patients contemplating pregnancy without a compelling life- or organ-threatening indication. This patient has well-controlled SLE but is taking mycophenolate mofetil, which should be discontinued 3 months before conception is attempted. Routine use of azathioprine in pregnancy is not advised; however, this drug is safer than other agents and can be used if necessary. In this patient with a history of lupus nephritis, azathioprine can reduce the risk for flare or disease progression. Hydroxychloroquine can be safely used during pregnancy in most patients to reduce the risk for SLE flare or other complications and should be continued."
