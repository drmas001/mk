") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. He has hemodynamically stable narrow-complex tachycardia consistent with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The rhythm is regular, and no obvious P waves are visible on his ECG. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which accounts for up to two thirds of SVT, is the most likely cause. Patients often report neck pulsations, which are caused by simultaneous contraction of the atria and ventricles. The ventricular rate is generally between 120/min and 220/min. Vagal maneuvers block the atrioventricular (AV) node by increasing vagal tone and can help diagnose and treat SVT. Because the patient could not terminate his tachycardia with vagal maneuvers, adenosine should be administered. Adenosine is an endogenous nucleotide that is a short-acting blocker of AV node conduction. It is highly effective at termination of nodal-dependent rhythms and can help identify the underlying cause. For example, continued atrial activity (P waves) during AV block can help identify atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia. Patients given adenosine should be on a cardiac monitor with a running paper rhythm strip to document the results. Before taking adenosine, patients should be warned that they may experience nausea, flushing, chest pain, or a sense of dread. Patients with bronchospastic lung disease should not receive adenosine."
