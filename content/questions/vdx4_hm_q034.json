"The most likely diagnosis is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In ALL, the leukocyte count can be low, normal, or elevated, but most patients have circulating lymphoblasts as seen in this smear. Lymphoblasts vary from small cells with minimal cytoplasm, condensed nuclear chromatin, and difficult to visualize nucleoli to larger cells with moderate amounts of cytoplasm, dispersed chromatin, and multiple nucleoli. Auer rods are never present. ALL is more common in children and adolescents than in adults. Patients with ALL present with malaise, bleeding, infections, bone pain, or a combination of these symptoms, with a small subset (<10%) having symptomatic central nervous system involvement at diagnosis. Although the smear suggests the diagnosis, flow cytometry is needed to confirm the presence of ALL."
