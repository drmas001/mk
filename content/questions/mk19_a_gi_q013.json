"). Although most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are sporadic, some are associated with hereditary endocrinopathies, such MEN1, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis. Among these inherited endocrinopathies, MEN1 is most frequently associated with pancreatic NETs (≥80%), whereas pancreatic NETs occur in 1% to 20% of the other inherited endocrinopathies. MEN1 is a rare heritable disorder classically characterized by a predisposition to tumors of the parathyroid glands, anterior pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells, including insulinoma, as seen in this patient. MEN1 is clinically diagnosed by the presence of two or more primary MEN1 tumor types. In patients who have family members with a diagnosis of MEN1, the presence of a single MEN1-associated tumor satisfies the diagnostic criteria for MEN1. Pancreatic NETs account for the greatest proportion of deaths in patients with MEN1, and gastrinoma is the most common of the functioning NETs. However, most gastrinomas are located in the duodenal wall, not the pancreas. Insulinomas are the second most common NET and the most common pancreatic NET; they tend to be small and may be multiple. Sporadic insulinomas occur in patients age 40 years and older; therefore, the diagnosis of insulinoma in a younger patient is cause to screen for MEN1."
