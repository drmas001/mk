"). Although he is asymptomatic, it should be assumed that he was intentionally exposed to anthrax spores. Postexposure prophylactic antibiotic therapy must begin immediately after any local or systemic infection has been excluded. Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are the preferred first-line agents. Doxycycline is the safer choice in this patient, who has a history of tendon repair, because of the association of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone options (levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) with the risk of tendinopathy. Because antibiotics are only active against vegetative bacilli, they are administered for 60 days, helping to ensure that late germination of spores lying dormant in the lungs and macrophages does not evolve into active disease. Postexposure protocols for anthrax include immunization along with antibiotics. The approved vaccine should be given within 10 days of exposure and is administered subcutaneously on weeks 0, 2, and 4."
