Patients with stage G3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more likely to die of a cardiovascular event than they are to progress to stage G4 CKD or to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) that requires initiation of renal replacement therapy. Also, the risk for cardiovascular-related death in patients with stages G3 and G4 CKD is four to five times higher than the risk for progression to ESKD (",

Mortality risk in these patients increases with a decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate and increasing albuminuria. Therefore, management of CKD addresses traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure control, glycemic control for patients with diabetes mellitus, and treatment of hyperlipidemia."
