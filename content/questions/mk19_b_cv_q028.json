"). This patient has limb symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Generally, patients with claudication have an ABI of 0.40 to 0.90, whereas patients with ischemic rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene have an ABI less than 0.40. A resting ABI greater than 1.40 indicates the presence of noncompressible, calcified arteries in the lower extremities and is considered uninterpretable. Between 19% and 31% of patients with typical claudication symptoms have a normal or borderline ABI. Because this patient with classic claudication symptoms and faint pulses has a nondiagnostic ABI, further testing is indicated. Exercise ABI testing is useful in patients with ABI values between 0.91 and 1.40 and high pretest probability of PAD. It requires ABI measurements at rest and after treadmill walking or plantar flexion exercises. A post-exercise ankle pressure drop of 30 mm Hg or more or significant decline in the ABI suggests PAD."

In this patient, the resting ABI was normal; thus, the indication for segmental blood pressure measurement is unclear."
