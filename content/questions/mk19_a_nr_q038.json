His history includes high-frequency hearing loss, macular degeneration, and hypertension. Medications are lisinopril and chlorthalidone."

"). Delirium is a potentially preventable syndrome associated with other medical disorders, the adverse effects of medication, or drug withdrawal. It is common in hospitalized patients, and elderly patients such as this one are at higher risk postsurgery. Delirium is associated with increases in morbidity, medical complications, hospital length of stay, and rate of discharge to long-term care facilities; prevention is more effective than treatment of delirium, especially in at-risk patients. Identifying and correcting sensory impairments, including providing patients with their visual and hearing aids, is an environmental modification that has been shown to be effective in the prevention of delirium."

Because altered circadian rhythm is a component of the clinical syndrome of delirium, promoting a normal sleep-wake cycle by limiting interruptions during nocturnal sleeping hours, minimizing light and noise at night, and opening curtains and encouraging activity during the daytime is an important element in the prevention of delirium. Finally, frequent monitoring of vital signs may provide early detection of changes in clinical status but will not prevent delirium."

"No medication is currently approved by the FDA for the management of delirium, so the use of these agents for such an indication is off-label.
