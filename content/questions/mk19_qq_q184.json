"). Urticaria, also known as hives, is a common skin finding caused by mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory proteins. This results in sudden, but transient, cutaneous swelling and erythema. Individual lesions may be erythematous or white, often surrounded by a red halo, and have a variety of shapes, including round, oval, annular, arciform, and serpiginous. The center of a lesion is typically blanchable pink or clear skin. These lesions are extremely pruritic and tend to appear on body sites with repetitive pressure or rubbing, such as the waistline and posterior neck. Although individual urticarial lesions should resolve in less than 24 hours, recurrent crops of hives may last for weeks. Acute urticaria may be related to environmental allergens, including drugs, viral infections, foods, and occasionally inhalants; however, in most cases, the cause is never determined. This man with transient, well-demarcated, pruritic plaques exhibits key features of acute urticaria. Chronic urticaria is an urticarial condition lasting longer than 6 weeks. If individual urticarial lesions do not resolve after 24 hours, or if they are accompanied by pain or systemic symptoms (joint pain, fever), urticarial vasculitis must be considered."

The skin is either normal or red in color, and itching is absent unless associated with urticarial lesions. This man has urticaria that is neither severe nor localized to characteristic angioedema body locations."
