") is the most appropriate test to perform next. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with heart failure, and the elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level supports this. Significantly increased wall thickness is present on the echocardiogram, with discordantly low voltage on the ECG. These findings suggest an infiltrative cardiomyopathy and, in combination with the patient's history of carpal tunnel syndrome, suggest possible transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) amyloidosis. ATTR amyloidosis is much more common in men. If cardiac amyloidosis is present in this patient, CMR imaging with gadolinium contrast would likely show diffuse late mid-myocardial gadolinium enhancement in a noncoronary distribution. CMR imaging with gadolinium is highly sensitive and specific for cardiac amyloidosis, but it does not distinguish between AL (immunoglobulin light-chain) amyloidosis and ATTR amyloidosis. An abnormal 99m-technetium pyrophosphate scan would confirm ATTR amyloidosis without the need for a biopsy."
