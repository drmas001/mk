"). Allopurinol is associated with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Allopurinol-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions are rare, usually occur in the presence of chronic kidney disease and diuretic use, and have a high mortality rate. The risk for severe cutaneous adverse reactions is significantly increased in patients with the HLA-B*58:01 haplotype, but these reactions still occur infrequently. The use of allopurinol is contraindicated in patients with HLA-B*58:01 positivity. HLA-B*58:01 prevalence varies by race and ethnicity; rates are higher in Asian (5.3%) and African (3.8%) persons than in White and Hispanic persons (<1%). The 2020 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Management of Gout conditionally recommends genetic testing before prescribing allopurinol for patients of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, or African descent."

") is recommended for patients with gout plus any of the following: (1) stage 2 or greater chronic kidney disease; (2) two or more acute attacks per year; (3) one or more tophi; or (4) uric acid nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the recommended first-line choice for urate-lowering therapy. During initiation of urate-lowering therapy, mobilization of uric acid crystals from the joints and soft tissues can provoke acute attacks. Accordingly, patients starting urate-lowering therapy should receive anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to prevent flares. Choices include colchicine, low-dose NSAIDs, or low-dose glucocorticoids. In this patient, initiation of urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol with colchicine or prednisone) is not appropriate until the results of genetic testing are known."
