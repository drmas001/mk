The patient is able to ambulate short distances in the home with a walker. She does not toilet independently and requires assistance with feeding, bathing, and dressing. Current medical problems include type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. Medications are metformin, losartan, atorvastatin, and acetaminophen."

"). Abuse and mistreatment occur in up to 10% of older adults and can take the form of neglect or physical, sexual, verbal/emotional, or financial abuse. Women are at higher risk than are men. Other risk factors include dementia; low socioeconomic level; younger age; poor social support; poor functional status; and shared living situations, especially in homes with multiple adults other than the spouse. Elder abuse is associated with increased risk for hospitalization and nursing home placement, as well as mood disorders and reduced quality of life. Findings suggestive of abuse or neglect, whether thought to be intentional or unintentional, should prompt additional investigation. Such investigation should ideally include a home assessment, which can be most reliably conducted under the auspices of Adult Protective Services."

") is a survey-based screening instrument for elder abuse. It is mostly reliant on patient self-report of symptoms; therefore, its use is limited, particularly if the patient is afraid of reporting neglect or abuse. Patients who are willing and able to communicate should be interviewed separately from the suspected abuser, using indirect questions (such as “Do you feel safe in your home?”). It is doubtful that this patient would complete a self-report screening tool such as the Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test."
