") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient who presents with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This patient is reflective of those included in the EAST-AFNET 4 randomized clinical trial, which evaluated a rhythm control strategy versus usual care (typically including rate control) in patients with a recent diagnosis (within 12 months) of atrial fibrillation and coexisting cardiovascular conditions. The inclusion criteria were age older than 75 years or previous transient ischemic attack or stroke, or two of the following: age older than 65 years, female sex, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, severe coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The trial demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, including a reduction in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure or acute coronary syndrome, among patients randomly assigned to an early rhythm control strategy, including asymptomatic patients. The intervention included either antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation, but importantly, it included aggressive concomitant medical therapy (e.g., oral anticoagulation when indicated, hypertension treatment) in both the intervention and the control groups. Based on the trial results, this patient is mostly likely to benefit from early rhythm control for atrial fibrillation."

"Oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation can be accomplished with a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or DOAC, such as rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and is associated with less intracranial and fatal bleeding. The 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association atrial fibrillation guideline recommends DOACs in preference to warfarin in DOAC-eligible patients. Thus, there is no suggestion that switching to warfarin (",
