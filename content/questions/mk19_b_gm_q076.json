"). This patient developed allergic contact dermatitis to bacitracin ointment. Contact dermatitis is an eczematous eruption that occurs at the site of allergen contact with the skin and is characterized by pruritic, erythematous patches or plaques that may show vesicles and weeping acutely, or dry scaling and lichenification at later stages. Although the patient discontinued using bacitracin 3 days before presenting, erythema and pruritus persist and would be best treated with a topical glucocorticoid, such as triamcinolone cream. Bacitracin, polymyxin B, and neomycin are common topical antibiotics used to treat or prevent wound infections and are frequently associated with allergic contact dermatitis. For clean wounds, such as a skin surgical site, the application of plain petrolatum is recommended over the use of topical antibiotics."
