"). Heat stroke is a failure of the body's thermal regulatory system caused by dysfunction, as in elderly patients taking anticholinergic medications; volume depletion (diuretics, insensible water loss); or overwhelming of the system, as in athletes or military recruits who train strenuously in hot, humid weather. They may also experience hypotension, nausea, and muscle weakness. This patient has nonexertional heat stroke. It is generally defined by a core body temperature above 40 °C (104.0 °F) along with encephalopathy. Additional complications of heat stroke can include kidney and liver injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rhabdomyolysis. The elderly are particularly vulnerable, with added risk from comorbidities and medications. If untreated, mortality in heat stroke can reach 60%. Treatment of nonexertional heat stroke includes evaporative cooling (with water mist and fans) with or without ice packs to lower the core temperature to a safe temperature, usually 38.5 °C (101.3 °F). Evaporative cooling is effective, noninvasive, and easily performed, and does not interfere with other aspects of patient care. It is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality when used to treat elderly patients with classic heat stroke."

"). When a patient with inherited susceptibility is exposed to one of these agents, he or she may develop muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and core body temperature elevation to 45.0 °C (113.0 °F) or more. Mortality can reach 10%. Treatment consists of discontinuing the triggering agent, active cooling, and administration of the muscle relaxant dantrolene every 5 to 10 minutes until muscle rigidity and hyperthermia resolve. Dantrolene is ineffective in patients with severe temperature elevation not caused by malignant hyperthermia."
