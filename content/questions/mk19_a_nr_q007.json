"). The patient has had a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to a ruptured aneurysm in the posterior communicating artery that has now been occluded to prevent neurologic decline from aneurysmal rebleeding. Treatment of SAH focuses on prevention of early (â‰¤48 hours) and late neurologic complications. Within the first 48 hours, a major cause of morbidity is aneurysmal rebleeding; early surgical exclusion of the ruptured aneurysm and blood pressure control are the foundations of early treatment. The target blood pressure for patients following SAH is not well defined, but guidelines suggest a systolic blood pressure of less than 160 mm Hg as reasonable. Late complications include elevated intracranial pressure from obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebral edema, seizures, and cerebral vasospasm. Cerebral vasospasm with resultant cerebral ischemia and neurologic worsening may develop beginning near day 5. Nimodipine should be started as early as possible once the patient is stabilized to improve neurologic outcomes. Nimodipine was thought to prevent cerebral artery vasospasm, but evidence for this effect is lacking. However, nimodipine does improve clinical outcomes in patients with SAH and is recommended in all patients as soon as possible following diagnosis."
