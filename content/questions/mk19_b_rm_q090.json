Plain radiography of the hands and/or feet is the standard imaging study for rheumatoid arthritis and can aid in diagnosis. Radiography of the hands and/or feet may also detect changes suggesting other diseases that may mimic rheumatoid arthritis, such as psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, gout, or chondrocalcinosis. Although early radiographs may be normal, this patient has the typical radiographic changes of rheumatoid arthritis, including periarticular osteopenia, marginal erosions, and joint-space narrowing. These radiographic findings add to the diagnostic certainty that the patient has rheumatoid arthritis and are helpful not only in establishing the diagnosis but in monitoring the course of the disease."
