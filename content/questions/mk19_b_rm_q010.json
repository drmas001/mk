"). Some patients with dermatomyositis never develop muscle involvement (amyopathic dermatomyositis); these patients can be diagnosed with skin biopsy confirmation of dermatomyositis in the setting of at least 6 months without muscle involvement. A characteristic skin rash should prompt consideration of dermatomyositis even with normal muscle strength and a normal serum creatine kinase level. This patient has a typical photosensitive distribution of dermatomyositis rash on the face, including a probable early heliotrope rash over the eyelids. He also has Gottron papules on the elbows and knees. Skin biopsy would likely show characteristic interface dermatitis. Further evaluation can include antibody and additional testing for subtle muscle inflammation, using electromyography or MRI, but even if the results are normal, this patient should be treated for dermatomyositis. Patients with amyopathic dermatomyositis also have a high risk for interstitial lung disease and cancer; screening for these conditions should also be part of the initial evaluation."
