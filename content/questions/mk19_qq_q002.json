"). She has end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and presents with muscle weakness, hyperkalemia, and peaked T waves on ECG. Signs and symptoms are related to adverse effects of serum potassium on skeletal and cardiac muscle cell membranes, including muscle weakness and cardiac conduction and rhythm abnormalities. IV calcium gluconate stabilizes the myocardium by lowering the threshold potential and is usually administered acutely to decrease the risk for arrhythmias; however, calcium does not have any effect on serum potassium levels. The appropriate treatment for reducing serum potassium quickly in this patient with ESKD and hyperkalemia is both insulin and glucose given intravenously to rapidly shift potassium intracellularly. Insulin effectively drives potassium into cells by increasing activity of the Na",
