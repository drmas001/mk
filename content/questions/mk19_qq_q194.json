") is the most appropriate next step before initiating pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis. Although osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is most commonly associated with nonmodifiable risk factors (age, sex, menopausal status, height, and build), it is always important to assess for possible secondary causes of bone loss that might be amenable to treatment, particularly if there is clinical suspicion in a specific patient. Appropriate laboratory testing for most patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis includes complete blood count (to evaluate for malignancy, including multiple myeloma); metabolic profile (calcium levels, liver and kidney function); and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, TSH, and urine calcium (hypercalciuria) levels. This patient's unintentional weight loss and heat intolerance may be symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which might contribute to her osteoporosis and should be treated along with therapy for her osteoporosis."

"), are released from osteoclasts and osteoblasts as part of bone metabolism. However, they are not used for clinical decision making in most patients with osteoporosis, primarily because of the significant variability in the different measures within individual patients or among different patients, which makes standardization of results difficult. Therefore, use of bone turnover markers is typically limited to research settings or the management of specific patients who have not responded to usual therapy for osteoporosis."
