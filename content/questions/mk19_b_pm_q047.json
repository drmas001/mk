") should be performed next. PET utilizes the radionuclide 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose, which accumulates within highly metabolically active cells such as cancer cells and can be visualized as discrete areas of uptake. Integrated PET/CT allows improved localization of the metabolic activity. PET scans are widely used to evaluate risk of malignancy in lung nodules, to stage known thoracic tumors, and to evaluate for metastatic disease from other nonthoracic malignancies. False-positive PET scans can occur in other hypermetabolic conditions, such as infection or inflammation, in which cells accumulate fluorodeoxyglucose. False-negative results can occur when tumors have low rates of metabolic activity, such as carcinoid, adenocarcinoma in situ, and, rarely, metastatic kidney, prostate, or testicular cancer. PET is not useful in determining malignancy in lung nodules less than 8 mm in size; however, a PET/CT scan can help in staging and needle positioning for biopsy targets. For example, in this patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule, a PET/CT scan may help determine whether any lymph node involvement is present that was not visible on the chest CT scan, providing a potentially more accessible and strategically important biopsy target."

EBUS with transbronchial needle aspiration is the initial procedure for obtaining tissue from mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in the diagnosis and staging of patients with known or suspected thoracic malignancy. An integrated PET/CT scan can guide where to biopsy, and it would be premature to perform an EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration without this information."

However, because the slice interval (the distance between individual slices) with high-resolution CT is larger than with conventional CT, this technique “skips” interval sections of the lung and should not be used to evaluate lung nodules. A high-resolution CT scan cannot stage lung cancer or guide where to biopsy."
