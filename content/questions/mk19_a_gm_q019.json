"). Falls onto outstretched hands resulting in pain in the anatomic snuffbox, especially in male athletes in the second or third decade of life, should raise high clinical suspicion for scaphoid fracture. The location of the scaphoid bone, articulating with the distal radius and four carpal bones, makes it prone to fracture. Because of the complexity of the anatomy, scaphoid fractures are often missed on initial radiographs, which are normal in up to 20% of patients. If scaphoid fracture is suspected and initial radiographs are normal, either splinting with repeat radiography in 1 to 2 weeks or immediate advanced imaging with MRI or CT is indicated. Several studies suggest that immediate MRI or CT is more cost-effective than splinting and repeat radiography when follow-up care, missed fracture, and lost productivity are taken into account. If diagnosed immediately, nondisplaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures may be managed with immobilization of the wrist in a cast or with splinting for 4 to 12 weeks. Undiagnosed, untreated scaphoid fracture may develop into scaphoid nonunion with degeneration of the distal radius, leading to progressive arthritis months to years after the initial injury."

") has the greatest sensitivity of all advanced imaging modalities for acute scaphoid fracture. However, to maximize sensitivity, scintigraphy must be delayed for 72 hours after the event. Scintigraphy also has the lowest specificity of all advanced imaging modalities, resulting in overtreatment of patients with positive scan results but no fracture. Bone scintigraphy is not the best option for this patient."
