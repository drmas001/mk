"). This patient's symptoms of dyspnea and syncope are consistent with symptomatic, potentially severe aortic stenosis. When caused by aortic stenosis, syncope is usually a late finding and raises concern for sudden cardiac death if aortic stenosis is not adequately treated. Severe aortic stenosis is typically defined by a small valve area (≤1.0 cm",

},
"), high peak velocity (≥4 m/s), and/or high mean gradient (≥40 mm Hg). However, although the two-dimensional morphologic description of this patient's aortic valve is consistent with severe aortic stenosis (severely thickened, minimally mobile tricuspid aortic valve), the mean valve gradient and aortic valve area are consistent with moderate aortic stenosis. Because technical considerations may result in either over- or underestimation of aortic valve gradient and aortic valve area by echocardiography, further hemodynamic testing with cardiac catheterization should be pursued in cases of discrepant clinical and echocardiographic findings."
