"). Stage III is defined by metastases to the local-regional lymph nodes. Stage III colon cancer is potentially curable, although the risk of treatment failure increases with the number of positive nodes. Currently, all patients with stage III disease are recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy after definitive surgery, as large randomized trials have shown that this treatment modestly improves the likelihood of cure. The combination of oxaliplatin plus a fluoropyrimidine such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or its oral prodrug, capecitabine, has long been the accepted standard postoperative management for stage III colon cancer. The most commonly used regimen is the FOLFOX regimen of 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. 5-FU is given with the reduced folate leucovorin, which is inactive alone but causes 5-FU to bind more tightly to its target enzyme. Oxaliplatin with oral capecitabine is also an acceptable regimen for adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer."

"), and cetuximab have all been shown to be ineffective in improving survival in the adjuvant setting, yet all are part of standard treatment of metastatic disease. For example, the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab is often given concurrently with first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in patients with metastatic colon cancer. This agent has essentially no antitumor activity in colorectal cancer on its own, but it does potentiate other chemotherapies, resulting in a modestly increased duration of progression-free survival, and in some studies, in increased duration of overall survival. Because bevacizumab is not an effective adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer, treatment with this agent is not appropriate."
