") will most likely confirm the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis as the cause of this patient's acute kidney injury (AKI). In rhabdomyolysis, myoglobin is released in the circulation from damaged skeletal muscle, causing AKI via intravascular volume depletion, renal vasoconstriction, direct proximal tubular injury, and tubular obstruction. Major causes of rhabdomyolysis include trauma, drugs and toxins, seizures, metabolic and electrolyte disorders, endocrinopathies (diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, hypothyroidism), and exercise. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and a history of predisposing factors (such as prolonged immobilization or drug toxicity) and confirmed by the presence of an elevated serum CK level (often >5000 U/L) and myoglobinuria (detected by a positive urine dipstick for blood in the absence of erythrocytes). Other possible laboratory manifestations may include hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment consists of aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation; fluids should be adjusted to maintain the hourly urine output of greater than 200 to 300 mL until the urine is negative for myoglobin. AKI resulting from acute tubular necrosis occurs in approximately one third of patients with rhabdomyolysis. Dialysis is sometimes necessary to correct severe electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities or significant volume overload."

Causes include glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, drug reactions, hemolysis related to cardiopulmonary bypass circuits, transfusion of stored red blood cells, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, malaria, certain poisonings, and snakebites."
