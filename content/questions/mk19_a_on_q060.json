"). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects. This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including patients with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy (such as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ). This recommendation does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. A variety of tools, including the Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool (",

"), provide decision support in estimating the risk of breast cancer. The USPSTF advises against using any hard cut-off point for defining increased risk but suggests focusing instead on each woman's values and priorities in weighing the reduced risk of breast cancer with increased likelihood of adverse effects."

"). Tamoxifen is effective in the chemoprevention of breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women and reduces the risk of breast cancer by approximately 30%. Tamoxifen is associated with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and has a black box warning for use among patients with a previous history of VTE. Raloxifene, effective in breast cancer chemoprevention for postmenopausal women, also increases the risk of VTE, although not to as great an extent. Both drugs should be avoided in women with prior VTE if there are suitable alternatives. Exemestane is an option for chemoprevention of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with a previous history of VTE. Exemestane is not associated with an increased risk of VTE."
