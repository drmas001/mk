{

"), is the safest choice. This patient likely has allergic contact dermatitis in reaction to his cologne. Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IV, T-cell–mediated, delayed hypersensitivity reaction. On re-exposure to a specific allergen, sensitized T-cells trigger an inflammatory cascade, leading to an eczematous eruption at the site of contact; rarely, a widespread eruption (autoeczematization or id reaction) may occur. Irritant contact dermatitis is more common than allergic contact dermatitis and is not immune mediated. Irritant contact dermatitis occurs from direct damage to the skin from harsh chemicals, soaps, or detergents. In addition to avoidance of the causative agent and treatment with emollients several times a day, topical glucocorticoids may help with symptom resolution. Appropriate choice of a topical glucocorticoid requires consideration of both the nature of the skin disease and the anatomic site being treated. Adverse effects of topical glucocorticoids include thinning of the skin, development of striae and hypopigmentation, and, with long-term use, development of telangiectasias. Anatomic areas that are at particular risk of complications from topical glucocorticoids include the face (particularly around the eyes, where skin is very thin) and any occluded areas of skin, such as the axillae, inguinal folds, skin under pendulous breasts, and abdominal pannus. When used on the face, halogenated (mid- and high-potency) glucocorticoids can induce acne, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, and rebound dermatitis. To minimize the risk of complications, lower-potency glucocorticoids should be used in intertriginous areas, and hydrocortisone base should be used on the face. Patients should be taught to use an adequate amount of glucocorticoid to treat the affected skin and should be encouraged to use it only as long as necessary."
