") in this patient who most likely has a malignant melanoma. Melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancerâ€“related deaths, and early detection and diagnosis are imperative. Skin biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. An excisional biopsy, a technique in which the entire lesion is removed using 1- to 2-mm peripheral margins, is the most appropriate biopsy technique. For localized melanomas, prognosis is related to the depth of invasion, either by Clark level (I to V) or by Breslow depth. A high mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, and the presence of bleeding or ulceration are poor prognostic signs. As the depth of invasion increases, the risk for nodal and ultimately distant metastasis increases. Lesion depth also informs the nature of definitive excision. A margin of 1 cm is acceptable for lesions that are less than 1 mm in thickness. Melanomas between 1 mm and 2 mm in thickness should be resected with a 2-cm margin, provided that a skin graft is not required for closure. Lesions that are greater than 2 mm in thickness should also be resected with 2-cm margins."

") or other destructive therapies, such as electrodesiccation and curettage, should not be used to treat pigmented lesions that are suspicious for malignant melanoma. Destructive therapies of this type remove the ability to determine the depth of the lesion, which is important for determining prognosis and planning surgical excision. In addition, destroying the tumor removes the ability assess for genetic mutations that may guide future therapy."

A deep shave (scoop or saucerization) biopsy to a depth below the lesion is also adequate but is best performed by dermatologists, who have more experience with this procedure. However, an excisional biopsy is most appropriate because it enables the entire lesion to be examined by the pathologist for an accurate Breslow depth measurement, the most important factor in determining prognosis."
