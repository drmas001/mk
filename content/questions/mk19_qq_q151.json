"). To decrease the burden of pertussis in infants (who are at greatest risk for the disease), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that pregnant women receive a single dose of the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy, regardless of when they last received either the tetanus and diphtheria (Td) or Tdap vaccine. Because maternal immunity wanes over time, administering the Tdap vaccine between 27 weeks' and 36 weeks' gestation is thought to provide optimal protection against pertussis for the infant throughout the newborn period, during which time the child is solely dependent on maternal antibodies for protection, by boosting the mother's antibody levels. The Td and Tdap vaccines do not contain live elements and are considered safe to administer to pregnant women; there is no evidence to suggest an increased rate of adverse events in this population."
