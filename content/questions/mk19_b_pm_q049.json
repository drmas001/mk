"). The patient has hypercapnic respiratory failure due to a combination of opiates (oxycodone) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), in which the obesity has led to mechanical changes that increase the load that the respiratory muscles must overcome. The addition of opiates decreased the respiratory drive in a patient that had underlying hypoventilation. BPAP delivers a higher level of positive airway pressure during inspiration than during expiration. In the acute setting, the difference between expiratory and inspiratory pressure helps the respiratory muscles generate appropriate tidal volumes. A backup respiratory rate can also be designated to initiate breaths in patients who have a low respiratory rate. The 2019 guidelines from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend that hospitalized patients suspected of having OHS should be started on noninvasive ventilation with either BPAP or volume-targeted pressure support and continued on this therapy until they undergo outpatient evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ideally during the first 3 months after hospital discharge."

However, it does not address concurrent obstructive sleep apnea and can lead to electrolyte abnormalities. Acetazolamide may be considered as an adjuvant treatment in patients with refractory OHS who continue to hypoventilate even with noninvasive ventilation and weight loss."

Until that time, the ATS recommends that patients with OHS be treated with either BPAP or volume-targeted pressure support."
