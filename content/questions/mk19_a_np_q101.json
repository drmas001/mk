"). This patient has end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to long-standing urinary retention from prostatic hyperplasia. There is no significant diuresis during the 48 hours since bladder catheter placement, and the decrease in his serum creatinine level is insignificant. The small kidney sizes with severe cortical echogenicity and thinning suggest advanced chronic kidney disease. Patients with ESKD and advanced age or multiple comorbidities may not want renal replacement therapy. For these patients, palliative care aimed at improving the quality of life may be a better option. Such care aligns treatment with a patient's goals through culturally sensitive shared decision-making and advance care planning, along with treating symptoms resulting from uremia, hypervolemia, hyperkalemia, and/or acidosis. Therefore, a discussion of overall goals of care is the most appropriate next step."
