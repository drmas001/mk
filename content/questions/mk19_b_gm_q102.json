"), or inflammation of the episclera, the highly vascularized connective tissue layer that lies between the conjunctiva and sclera. This patient has a classic presentation of episcleritis, with abrupt onset of unilateral eye redness, irritation, and tearing. Pain, photophobia, and vision changes are typically absent. Examination shows dilation of superficial episcleral blood vessels, with normal sclera visualized between the blood vessels. Redness can be localized or diffuse; involvement is more commonly unilateral than bilateral. Nodular variants of episcleritis also occur. Although most causes of episcleritis are idiopathic, it can be associated with systemic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Women are more commonly affected than men, with most cases occurring in those who are young or middle aged. Use of a topical vasoconstrictor, such as phenylephrine, results in improvement in eye redness and can help confirm the diagnosis."
