"). Atrial fibrillation (AF) complicates nearly 40% of heart failure cases, and the combination of AF and heart failure dramatically worsens outcomes. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that aggressive efforts to achieve rhythm control in patients with AF and concomitant heart failure decrease morbidity and mortality. In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, recent clinical trials have shown that catheter ablation of AF is associated with a favorable effect on morbidity and mortality compared with medical therapy. Amiodarone is another option for rhythm control. Although amiodarone carries a risk for toxicity, this patient's lifetime exposure to the drug is likely to be relatively low given her age, comorbid conditions, and probable amiodarone dosage, which is generally lower for AF than for ventricular arrhythmias. Monitored appropriately, it can be used safely and effectively in patients her age."

ICD placement is recommended for the primary prevention of SCD in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction less than 35%, and New York Heart Association functional class II or III heart failure. This patient with AF and an ejection fraction of 45% does not have an indication for ICD therapy."
