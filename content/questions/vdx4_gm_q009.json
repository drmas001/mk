"This patient's skin finding is most consistent with a halo nevus, which is a benign melanocytic nevus surrounded by a round “halo” of hypopigmentation or depigmentation. The lesion has three stages. In the first stage, there is pigment loss, which usually lasts months, and often heralds the regression of the nevus. The second stage is the regression of the nevus, which usually lasts years. In the third stage, there is repigmentation of the halo. It is commonly found on the upper back of adolescents and young adults."
