"). Patients with atypical features of Bell palsy, including multiple cranial nerve palsies, require additional evaluation. This patient should undergo MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium and with attention to the brainstem and internal auditory canal. Bell palsy is an acute-onset (usually over a period of hours) peripheral mononeuropathy involving the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) that leads to weakness in the muscles of facial expression in both the upper and lower face, hyperacusis, and impaired taste. In classic Bell palsy, initial brain imaging and laboratory testing are not required. However, muscles of mastication are innervated by the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and ocular abduction (ability to bury the sclera on lateral gaze) is innervated by the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). Presence of these findings and a subacute progressive course over 10 days are red flags that should prompt further workup, including brain imaging. In addition, serologic testing for causes of multiple cranial neuropathies and, if needed, cerebrospinal fluid analysis with cytology should also be considered."
