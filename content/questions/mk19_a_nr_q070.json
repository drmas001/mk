"A 51-year-old woman is evaluated for a 5-year history of increasingly frequent and disabling migraine episodes. Whereas she previously had migraine on the first 2 days of menses, migraine episodes now have increased to 10 days monthly; once monthly, she experiences a scotoma lasting 20 minutes before migraine onset. Oral and subcutaneous sumatriptan have been effective in controlling symptoms, but because of the increased frequency of her headaches she sometimes runs out of medication during the month. Preventive trials of propranolol, amitriptyline, and topiramate over the past 2 years have been unsuccessful."

"). The patient has migraine meeting criteria for migraine with aura. They remain episodic (<15 days monthly) but have become increasingly frequent. Pharmacologic prophylaxis should be considered when the headache frequency reaches 4 to 5 days per month and almost always is initiated when the frequency reaches 10 days per month. Data suggest preventive medication can reduce migraine attack frequency and intensity, patient disability, and medical costs. According to evidence-based guidelines, five medications (three β-blockers [propranolol, timolol, metoprolol] and two antiepileptic drugs [divalproex sodium and topiramate]) have Level A evidence supporting their use for the pharmacologic prevention of episodic migraine; level B evidence supports the use of amitriptyline and venlafaxine. Migraine-specific biologic therapies have been developed and proven extremely effective in the prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. The monoclonal antibodies erenumab, fremanezumab, eptinezumab, and galcanezumab target the calcitonin gene–related peptide or its receptor and are delivered by monthly subcutaneous injection. Guidelines recommend integrating these agents into prevention of episodic or chronic migraine after two or three adequate but unsuccessful trials of oral preventive medication."
