"). This patient has patent ductus arteriosusâ€“related Eisenmenger syndrome and symptomatic relative anemia. Most patients with cyanosis have compensated erythrocytosis with stable hemoglobin levels. Iron deficiency and resultant microcytosis in these patients are often caused by inappropriate phlebotomy or blood loss, such as menorrhagia, as in this case. This patient's baseline hemoglobin level was nearly 18 g/dL (180 g/L), and initial therapy should include oral iron therapy, which often causes a rapid increase in erythrocyte mass. When the hemoglobin level and hematocrit begin to increase in 7 to 10 days, iron therapy should be discontinued. Correction of iron deficiency is associated with increased exercise capacity and improved quality of life."
