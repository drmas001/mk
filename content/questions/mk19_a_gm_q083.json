"). Depression can present as cognitive impairment or worsening of preexisting cognitive impairment. Symptoms of depression, including somatic symptoms; fatigue/low energy; and cognitive symptoms, such as decreased concentration and psychomotor agitation or retardation, are often misattributed to chronic illness or cognitive impairment. All patients being evaluated for cognitive impairment should also be screened for depression. Both the Geriatric Depression Scale and the PHQ-9 have acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detecting depression in older patients. There are effective treatments for depression that can alleviate suffering and improve functioning."

") provides a more thorough assessment of cognitive function than office-based clinical assessments but is more time-consuming and costly. Detailed neuropsychological testing is especially useful for the following patients: those with milder cognitive symptoms, to determine whether the cognitive difficulties are within the realm of normal age-associated cognitive decline versus mild cognitive impairment; those with definite dementia, diagnosed on the basis of clinical impression and results of screening cognitive tests, who have clinical features overlapping two or more underlying pathologic processes; and those with cognitive symptoms whose clinical picture is confounded by significant depression. However, screening for and potentially treating depression should occur before considering neuropsychological testing in this patient."
