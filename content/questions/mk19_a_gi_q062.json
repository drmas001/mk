"). A 3-year colonoscopy interval is appropriate for patients with larger adenomas (≥10 mm), 5 to 10 tubular adenomas less than 10 mm, adenomas with tubulovillous or villous histology, or adenomas with high-grade dysplasia. A 3- to 5-year interval is appropriate for three or four tubular adenomas less than 10 mm. Between 20% and 53% of adults older than age 50 years have premalignant adenomas of the colon detected on screening, and 3% to 8% of the adenomas have advanced histologic features. Because adenomas are an intermediary step in the progression from normal colonic mucosa to colon cancer, identification and management of polyps are critical. The progression of adenoma to carcinoma takes approximately 8 to 10 years. Adenomas with any degree of villous histology or high-grade dysplasia have greater malignant potential. Risk is also substantially increased in polyps 10 mm or larger."
