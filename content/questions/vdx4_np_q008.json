"Glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis. This patient's urinalysis shows an erythrocyte cast and indicates glomerular disease. Erythrocytes may be distinct or incorporated into a homogenous mass. The most characteristic feature of an erythrocyte cast, when present, is its orange-red appearance. The glomerular hematuria seen in the nephritic syndrome can be distinguished from other causes of urinary tract bleeding by the presence of either dysmorphic erythrocytes (resulting from distortion that occurs as they pass through the glomerular basement membrane and then along the renal tubules) or erythrocyte casts on urine microscopy. Red blood cells lack a nucleus, which helps to distinguish them for other nucleated cell types. Common features of glomerulonephritis are hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic) and proteinuria, with the more severe forms typically including hypertension, edema, and kidney dysfunction (elevated serum creatinine)."
