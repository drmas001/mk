"). High-dose therapy is defined as â‰¥80 mg daily. Upper endoscopy should be performed within 24 hours in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). In this patient, endoscopy revealed a nonbleeding visible vessel within the ulcer base, which is classified as an ulcer with high risk for rebleeding (high-risk findings include active bleeding, active oozing, and nonbleeding visible vessels). Endoscopic therapy was appropriately performed to reduce the risk of rebleeding and mortality. To further reduce the risk of rebleeding and mortality following endoscopic therapy, high-dose PPI therapy should be provided either via continuous infusion or intermittently for 72 hours while the patient is hospitalized. Suggested continuous PPI therapy should consist of 80-mg bolus followed by 8-mg/hr infusion. Alternatively, intermittent oral or intravenous therapy should consist of an 80-mg bolus followed by a 40-mg bolus two to four times daily. The risk of rebleeding is further reduced by continuing the patient on twice-daily PPI therapy for a total of 2 weeks following the endoscopy (i.e., days 4 to 14 post therapeutic endoscopy)."
