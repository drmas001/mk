"A 34-year-old woman is evaluated for concerns about long-term stressors. She reports ongoing court battles with her former spouse over child custody. She also describes frustration about her current living situation stemming from arguments with her roommate about rent payments. She was previously treated by a psychiatrist for major depression but terminated the relationship because she and the psychiatrist “did not see eye to eye” about treatment options; she becomes angry when discussing this situation. She takes no medications."

") is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. A personality disorder is characterized by persistent patterns of inner experiences and behaviors that digress substantially from the expectations of the affected person's culture. Personality disorders are manifested by extreme behavior traits that cause clear difficulties in the lives and relationships of patients. These disorders can be divided into subtypes based on clusters of specific behaviors. In this case, the patient describes multiple problematic relationships (ex-spouse, roommate, former psychiatrist), which is a clue to the diagnosis."

Mania is clinically defined as an episode of at least 7 consecutive days of irritable, expansive, or elevated mood that interferes with social or occupational functioning and has at least three of the following characteristics (four if the patient reports irritable mood only): inflated self-esteem (grandiosity), increased talkativeness, flight of ideas, distractibility, decreased sleep need, increased goal-directed activity, and excessive risk-taking behaviors (promiscuity, spending sprees). This patient does not fulfill any of the diagnostic criteria."

Diagnosis requires the presence of three of the following physical symptoms: restlessness, being easily fatigued, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. The patient does not report any of these symptoms."
