"This patient has essential tremor, the most common movement disorder. Essential tremor often presents with a bilateral upper extremity postural and action tremor. As seen in the video, it is commonly present when the arms are outstretched but is not seen when the arms are relaxed and not held against gravity. This type of tremor may also involve the voice, head, or legs. Common features include a positive family history (50% of patients), slow progression, and onset at either adolescence or middle age."
