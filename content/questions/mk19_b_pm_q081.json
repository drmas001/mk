"). This patient has a unilateral exudative pleural effusion in the setting of pleural thickening and evidence of asbestos exposure. This clinical scenario strongly suggests malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm that originates from the cells that line the pleural cavity (mesothelium). It can present as small nodules, plaque-like masses, or confluent sheets that can encase the lung. It is associated with inhalational exposure to asbestos fibers and has a latency of 20 to 40 years. Tissue biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis; it can be performed with medical thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which has 90% sensitivity for malignancy. Because mesothelioma can be difficult to diagnose, patients will typically present with advanced disease. Other conditions that may have a similar presentation include a chronic empyema and malignant conditions such as sarcomas and peripheral adenocarcinomas."

"The sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology for the diagnosis of mesothelioma is as low as 5%; therefore a pleural biopsy is required to make the diagnosis. Adding a closed pleural biopsy to thoracentesis increases the sensitivity to approximately 36%. Medical or surgical thoracoscopy has greater than 90% sensitivity for malignancy. Therefore, neither a closed biopsy (",

") should be performed to evaluate the extent of the disease and help with staging. PET will not be as useful before biopsy because it will not differentiate between an infectious and an inflammatory cause of the pleural thickening. After tissue confirmation, mesothelioma is staged according to the TNM system; PET is often performed to help determine the extent of involvement. If there is limited involvement and no distant disease, some patients will benefit from surgery as well as chemotherapy and radiation. Prognosis for mesothelioma depends on the histologic features (sarcomatoid versus epithelioid) and staging at diagnosis, but overall it remains poor (median survival, 6-9 months)."
