"). Pulmonary nodules appear on radiography as small radiographic opacities (<3 cm in size) surrounded by normal lung parenchyma. These nodules are asymptomatic and are found either incidentally or on screening. In contrast, a focal pulmonary opacity larger than 3 cm is considered a lung mass and is presumed malignant until proved otherwise. This patient presents for evaluation of an incidentally found solid solitary pulmonary nodule. The first step in evaluation of a solitary pulmonary nodule is to determine likelihood of malignancy according to clinical and radiographic features. The risk can be considered low, intermediate, or high. This risk can be determined clinically or with quantitative prediction models such as the Brock University ",

". Factors that help predict malignancy include smoking history, age, sex (female sex is associated with greater risk than male), family history of lung cancer, emphysema, asbestos exposure, size of the nodule, location (upper lobe is associated with greater risk than is lower lobe), and nodule type. It is also important to review older scans to determine whether the nodule has grown over time. In patients who have a low risk for malignancy, like this patient, a nodule (solid or subsolid) that is smaller than 6 mm requires no further follow-up."
