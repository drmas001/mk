"). He has several risk factors for HIV acquisition, including diagnoses of rectal gonorrhea and syphilis, history of condomless sex, and insertive and receptive anal sex. PrEP is recommended for populations in which annual HIV incidence is at least 2%, which applies to men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States, especially with risk factors previously described. With good adherence, the efficacy of daily PrEP in MSM can be as high as 92%. A fourth generation HIV antigen/antibody combination assay should be performed within 7 days of PrEP initiation and repeated every 3 months; additionally, sexually transmitted infection screening should be done every 3 months, and serum creatinine should be evaluated every 6 months. Since 2012, the coformulation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine has been used for prevention and has been found to be safe overall, aside from a low risk of kidney dysfunction and reduced bone mineral density. Because of this, TDF and emtricitabine is not recommended for persons with a creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning is recommended in men older than 50 years and others at risk for osteoporosis. A second PrEP regimen, daily tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine, with a presumed lower risk of kidney and bone-related adverse effects, was approved in 2019 for use in men at high risk of HIV infection."
