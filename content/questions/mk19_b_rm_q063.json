Although gonococcal arthritis may present as an acute inflammatory monoarthritis, the most typical presentation is an arthritis-dermatitis syndrome characterized by fever, chills, malaise, acutely painful tenosynovitis, migratory arthralgia, and pustular or vesiculopustular skin lesions. More rarely, hemorrhagic macules or papules may be seen. Most patients have 2 to 10 skin lesions, most commonly on the distal extremities. Women may present during or immediately after menstrual periods. However, genital symptoms are often absent. Disseminated gonococcal infection should be part of the differential diagnosis for any sexually active patient presenting with possible infectious arthritis or infectious tenosynovitis, regardless of age."
