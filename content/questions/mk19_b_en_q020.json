"). “Cushing syndrome” is a term used to describe hypercortisolism, regardless of the cause. The initial step in evaluating suspected Cushing syndrome is to seek biochemical evidence of hypercortisolemia. At least two first-line tests must be abnormal to confirm the diagnosis. First-line tests include the overnight low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, 24-hour urine free cortisol measurement, and late-night salivary cortisol measurement. In this patient, the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome has been established given that both the urinary and late-night salivary cortisol levels are abnormal. After confirmation of Cushing syndrome, subsequent steps are to (1) determine if the Cushing syndrome is ACTH independent or dependent, and (2) localize the source of ACTH in ACTH-dependent disease or confirm the presence of adrenal mass (or masses) in ACTH-independent disease. In this patient, the next appropriate step is ACTH measurement to establish whether the patient has ACTH-dependent or -independent Cushing syndrome."

") or MRI is indicated. Cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas and, rarely, carcinomas account for 15% to 20% of endogenous causes of Cushing syndrome. Excess cortisol secretion from these tumors suppresses pituitary ACTH production and is ACTH independent. Demonstration of ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome is required, however, before adrenal CT imaging is ordered, so this step is not appropriate at this time for this patient."
