"). All persons with HIV infection should begin ART as soon as they are ready, regardless of CD4 cell count. A large prospective, randomized clinical trial has resolved controversy over whether to start ART in asymptomatic patients with normal CD4 cell counts, demonstrating clear clinical benefit. Waiting for the CD4 cell count to drop below 350/µL was shown to put patients at risk for harm from AIDS and non–AIDS-related complications (",
{
"type":"tag",
"tagName":"b",
"attrs":{
},
"children":[
"Option B"
]
},
"). HIV treatment guidelines recommend immediate ART initiation (either the same day as or within 2 weeks of diagnosis) if no medical contraindications (concomitant opportunistic infection in which immediate ART may be harmful) or structural barriers (staffing and linkage to care service availability) prevent doing so. The World Health Organization also endorses ART initiation within 7 days of new diagnosis (including same day), citing improved viral suppression. Transmitted drug resistance mutations have been a concern, and standard practice was to initiate ART only after genotyping data were available. However, this is changing as the rate of transmitted drug resistance mutations continues to fall. Many experts recommend initiating three-drug ART without waiting for genotyping results, especially if no barriers prevent immediate initiation. Updated guidelines have added select two-drug ART as a potential option for initial treatment of HIV infection; however, this should only be considered for individuals with HIV RNA less than 500,000 copies/mL, no hepatitis B co-infection, and available HIV reverse transcriptase genotypic resistance testing results. With immediate or rapid start, when genotype data are unavailable, a three-drug ART regimen is recommended."
