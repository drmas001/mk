"). The patient's history (fatigue and exertional dyspnea) and examination findings (opening snap and diastolic rumble) are consistent with mitral stenosis, which the echocardiogram confirms. However, quantitation of the mitral stenosis reveals a gradient and valve area consistent with moderate, rather than severe, mitral stenosis. Severe mitral stenosis is defined by a mitral valve area of 1.5 cm",

" or less, which usually corresponds to a mean mitral gradient of more than 5 to 10 mm Hg at a normal heart rate. This patient's symptoms are predominantly exertional, and decreased diastolic filling time with exertion typically results in an increased mitral gradient and left atrial and pulmonary pressures in mitral stenosis. In patients with a discrepancy between the clinical and echocardiographic findings, exercise echocardiography or exercise testing during cardiac catheterization should be pursued to assess the response of the mitral gradient and pulmonary pressures to an increased heart rate. Exercise testing is important because percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy is indicated for patients with severe mitral stenosis and favorable valve morphology."
