"). This patient has esophageal dysphagia in the setting of weight loss and history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Endoscopy should be performed to evaluate for malignancy. The most common initial presentation of esophageal carcinoma is dysphagia with solid foods; other symptoms include weight loss, anorexia, anemia caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, and chest pain. The two types of esophageal carcinoma are squamous cell carcinoma (most commonly located in the proximal esophagus) and adenocarcinoma (usually found in the distal esophagus). Risk factors for adenocarcinoma include male sex, older age, GERD, Barrett esophagus, obesity, and tobacco use. Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include tobacco and alcohol use, caustic injury, achalasia, past thoracic radiation, nutritional deficiencies (zinc, selenium), and poor socioeconomic status."

Even if a peptic stricture secondary to GERD were suspected, biopsy would still be necessary, making endoscopy the initial test of choice."
