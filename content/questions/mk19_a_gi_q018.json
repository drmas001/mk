"). Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic, inflammatory liver disease that has variable presentation, from asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferase levels to extrahepatic symptoms (e.g., myalgia and malaise) to acute liver failure. Diagnosis is based on laboratory test results, including the presence of antinuclear and smooth-muscle antibodies and elevated IgG levels, exclusion of other diagnoses (e.g., Wilson disease, viral hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury), and liver biopsy. Patients with severe presentations require management by a hepatologist. The mainstay of treatment is immunosuppression. Induction of remission is typically with prednisone or a combination of prednisone and azathioprine. Depending on response, maintenance therapy may consist of prednisone or azathioprine monotherapy or combination therapy. Because of the high rate of relapse, therapy is recommended for at least 2 to 3 years. Biochemical response may occur within 3 to 8 months of treatment in 85% of patients whose disease responds to standard treatment, but histologic response can lag by several months. Therefore, a liver biopsy is recommended to demonstrate absence of active inflammation before cessation of therapy."

"Normalization of liver test results is insufficient to determine when it is safe to stop therapy.

") are not recommended. Because of the adverse effects of immunosuppressant therapy, indefinite treatment is avoided if possible. Some patients will require indefinite maintenance therapy because of relapsing disease. However, it is too soon to know whether this patient will remain in remission or relapse after discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy."
