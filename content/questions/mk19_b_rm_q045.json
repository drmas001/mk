"). Inclusion body myositis is an uncommon cause of weakness generally seen in older adults, characterized by a slow, insidious onset. It can be distinguished clinically from polymyositis by the involvement of distal muscle groups in addition to proximal muscle groups. Weakness in finger flexors and atrophy of forearm muscles are characteristic features. Muscle distribution is usually but not always symmetric. Up to half of patients with inclusion body myositis have cricopharyngeal muscle involvement, leading to dysphagia and increased risk for aspiration. Patients with inclusion body myositis can have elevated serum creatine kinase levels, but elevations are usually more modest, less than 10 times the upper limit of normal, as compared with other forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in which serum creatine kinase levels are generally higher. A muscle biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis but is not needed when clinical features are characteristic."

") can also present with progressive muscle weakness. However, it generally progresses more rapidly over weeks or months and involves only the proximal muscles. Activities such as arising from a chair, climbing stairs, and lifting objects above shoulder height are typically affected. Onset over several years with a more modest degree of weakness, as seen in this patient, would be unusual in polymyositis. In addition, polymyositis would not be expected to cause weakness of the hands or the distal arm muscles."

"Statins are generally safe and well tolerated.

The patient's prolonged course, minor serum creatine kinase elevation, and muscle weakness distribution are more characteristic of inclusion body myositis than statin myopathy."
