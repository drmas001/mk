"A published systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effect of a new biologic agent for treatment of metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The largest of these demonstrated a statistically significant benefit associated with the new biologic agent. Three smaller trials showed a trend toward benefit that was not significant, and two trials showed a nonsignificant trend toward no benefit. In the trials that showed no benefit, the disease was considerably more advanced and patients had poorer performance status. Studies demonstrating trend toward benefit varied regarding inclusion of patients previously treated with other agents. The meta-analysis showed a beneficial treatment effect (",

"). Meta-analysis is a statistical method that combines the results from different studies included in systematic reviews. Systematic reviews are systematic literature searches performed by using predefined criteria to collect all relevant studies. The systematic selection of the included studies minimizes bias. The resultant larger sample size has greater power to discriminate differences between groups; thus, meta-analysis increases sample size and statistical power. Meta-analysis of high-quality randomized controlled trials is considered one of the highest levels of clinical evidence. Factors that limit the ability to combine study results meaningfully include differences in the study populations, research measures, and statistical techniques. These differences are termed heterogeneity. This systematic review had differences in patient populations that included more advanced disease, sicker patients, and variability in previous treatment before inclusion in the study."

") occurs when factors other than the treatments being studied are independently associated with the participants being studied and the end point being assessed. Although statistical techniques can account for known or anticipated confounders, random assignment of the intervention being studied (i.e., a randomized controlled study) best protects against both known and unknown confounders. This protection should also apply to meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials."
