" inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor) for 1 year after an acute coronary syndrome not treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients should also receive high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin), an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and a Î²-blocker (metoprolol, carvedilol). For patients with type 2 diabetes who have established ASCVD or established kidney disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) with demonstrated cardiovascular disease benefit is recommended as part of the glucose-lowering regimen. SGLT2 inhibitors with established cardiovascular disease benefit include empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin; corresponding GLP-1 RAs include albiglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and injectable semaglutide. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients demonstrated a reduction in the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular-related death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke) and all-cause mortality when empagliflozin was added to standard care versus placebo. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with previous amputation, severe peripheral neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or active diabetic foot ulcers or soft tissue infections. Patients should be monitored for genital fungal infection, urinary tract infection, euglycemic diabetic acidosis, and lower limb ulcerations and soft tissue infections. The presence of any of these conditions should prompt consideration of an alternative drug to reduce cardiovascular complications."
