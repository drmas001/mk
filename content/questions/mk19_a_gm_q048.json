"A 28-year-old woman is evaluated in the emergency department for an episode of syncope. Before the syncopal event, she was standing motionless in a warm environment for several minutes, and then she felt warm, dizzy, and nauseated. She lost consciousness for less than 30 seconds. She experienced no trauma during the event and had no confusion afterward. She has previously experienced presyncope at work while standing for long periods of time but had never lost consciousness. She has no medical problems and takes no medications."

"). This patient probably has vasovagal syncope, which is provoked by noxious stimuli, fear, stress, or heat overexposure and is preceded by a prodrome of warmth, dizziness, and nausea. In cases of vasovagal (reflex) syncope, explaining the diagnosis to the patient is strongly recommended, along with targeted education about avoiding triggers (e.g., prolonged standing, warm environments) and how to cope with noxious events (e.g., blood draws). In addition, physical counterpressure measures, such as squatting and leg crossing, and increased fluid and salt intake can decrease the risk for recurrence of the syncopal event in selected patients."

") has mineralocorticoid activity that increases blood volume through sodium and water retention. Hypertension and hypokalemia are expected adverse effects. Fludrocortisone might be considered for patients with vasovagal syncope not responding to avoidance of triggers and physical counterpressure measures. Studies show a 31% non–statistically significant reduction in recurrent syncope in patients with frequent vasovagal syncope after 2 weeks of therapy. Fludrocortisone is not indicated in this patient who has yet to try more effective means of syncope prevention that are associated with fewer side effects."
