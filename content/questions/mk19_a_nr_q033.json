Since he started this treatment 2 months ago, tremor and walking have improved, but he feels lightheaded upon standing. He also has type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Current medications are carbidopa-levodopa, metformin, and atorvastatin."

"). Patients with Parkinson disease and falls, such as this patient, should be assessed for postural imbalance, impaired stepping, freezing of gait, and orthostatic hypotension. This patient's history of lightheadedness on standing and substantial drop in standing blood pressure suggests orthostatic hypotension as the likely cause of his fall. Examination reveals no freezing of gait or postural impairment, findings that are often noted in more advanced Parkinson disease. Orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson disease can be due to disease-related autonomic dysfunction, comorbidities (such as diabetic autonomic neuropathy), or a peripheral effect of levodopa. Symptom onset after initiation of levodopa therapy should alert clinicians to this potential drug-related adverse effect. Carbidopa blocks the adverse effects of levodopa outside the brain and is always administered in combination with levodopa. However, in patients with severe peripheral side effects of levodopa, such as orthostatic hypotension, higher carbidopa doses can alleviate these symptoms."
