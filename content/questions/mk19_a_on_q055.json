"). She was diagnosed with locally advanced hypopharynx cancer. As is common in this type of cancer, treatment with combined chemotherapy and irradiation was recommended. She completed this treatment and achieved complete remission. Surveillance for recurrence is now indicated. Standard surveillance consists of physical examination and assessment for symptoms suggestive of recurrence. Physical examination includes in-office laryngoscopy to evaluate the upper aerodigestive tract for both local recurrence and development of second primary cancers. Following an imaging study identifying no active disease after completion of treatment, further imaging studies for surveillance purposes are not indicated. Such testing has not been shown to improve outcomes. Rather, imaging to look for recurrence is based on clinical suspicion of recurrence as directed by signs and symptoms. However, patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer are at risk for second cancers, most notably nonâ€“small cell lung cancer. This is especially true in patients aged 50 to 80 years who are current smokers or have quit less than 15 years ago and who have at least a 20-pack-year smoking history. All patients who meet criteria for lung cancer screening should be offered screening with a low-dose CT on an annual basis."
