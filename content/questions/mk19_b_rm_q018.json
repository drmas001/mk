"). This patient has an acute painful joint in the setting of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Hyperuricemia and gout are comorbidities associated with psoriasis. It is thought that the rapid turnover of skin cells in patients with psoriasis drives protein metabolism and increases serum urate levels. A recent study of two large cohorts, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses' Health Study, found that the risk for gout in participants with psoriasis was almost double that of participants without psoriasis; the risk was five times greater in participants with PsA than in those without either condition. This type of joint presentation (acute swelling, severe pain, unwillingness to flex or extend joint) can have one of three causes: infectious arthritis, hemarthrosis, or crystalline arthritis. Joint fluid analysis is necessary to make the correct diagnosis."
