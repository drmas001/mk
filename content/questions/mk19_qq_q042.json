"). Sinus node dysfunction can cause sinus or ectopic atrial bradycardia (rate <50/min), sinoatrial exit block, sinus pause (>3 seconds), sinus node arrest, tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, chronotropic incompetence, or isorhythmic dissociation. Symptoms of lightheadedness (most typical), near-syncope, syncope, or confusion are manifestations of hypoperfusion. Sinus node dysfunction can be caused by degenerative fibrosis of the sinoatrial node or be related to other myocardial disease processes. Medications such as β-blockers or parasympathetic nervous system stimulants (e.g., donepezil, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine) are the most common reversible cause of sinus node dysfunction. Permanent pacemaker implantation is the most appropriate treatment for symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with documented bradycardia not caused by treatable factors."

Ectopic junctional rhythm is characterized by lack of P waves before the QRS complexes, but retrograde P waves may be buried within QRS complex or occur after the QRS complex deforming the ST segment or T wave. Sinus node impulses are inhibited by the retrograde conducted P waves. This patient has P waves prior to each QRS complex, excluding the diagnosis of ectopic junctional rhythm."

This patient has no evidence of nonconducted P waves, excluding the diagnosis of second-degree heart block."
