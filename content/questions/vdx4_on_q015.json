"The most likely diagnosis is bladder cancer, the most common cancer of the genitourinary tract. Most patients have transitional cell carcinoma. This patient was diagnosed with a papillary transitional cell carcinoma. The most common presenting symptom is hematuria (often gross hematuria), which may be intermittent. It is typically painless, although irritative urinary symptoms may be present with or without hematuria. Any patient with gross hematuria should be referred for urologic evaluation, as should any patient confirmed to have persistent microscopic hematuria after evaluating benign causes, such as urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, or underlying kidney disease with a glomerular source of erythrocytes. Notably, use of anticoagulants does not alter these recommendations. The primary modality of initial evaluation is cystoscopy combined with urine cytology, with biopsy of any visible tumor or mucosal abnormality. Random biopsy is performed if no abnormality is seen."
