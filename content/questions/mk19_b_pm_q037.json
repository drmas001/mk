"). Approximately 10% of patients with systemic sclerosis develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are nonspecific; thus, the average time from symptom onset to diagnosis can exceed 2 years. Symptoms include exertional dyspnea or lightheadedness, lower extremity edema, chest pain, palpitations, and in some cases, syncope. Findings on physical examination frequently include an accentuated or persistently split S",

". A holosystolic tricuspid regurgitant murmur, jugular venous distention, a right ventricular heave, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema occur in the face of progressive right ventricular failure. Pulmonary findings reflect underlying lung disease when present. If PAH is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography should be pursued. Echocardiography provides an estimation of mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure and assessment of both right and left heart size and function. If the echocardiogram suggests PH, the patient should be referred for further evaluation, including right heart catheterization. In patients with systemic sclerosis, guidelines suggest annual screening with echocardiography for PH."
