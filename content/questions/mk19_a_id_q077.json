Brain abscesses in immunocompetent patients are mainly caused by bacteria that enter the brain through contiguous spread (e.g., following otitis, mastoiditis, sinusitis, neurosurgical procedures, or cranial trauma) or hematogenous dissemination (e.g., infective endocarditis, bacteremia from a dental source). Headache is the most common presenting symptom, with the classic triad (fever, headache, focal neurologic deficit) seen in only approximately 20% of patients. The most common bacteria causing brain abscesses are streptococci (e.g., ",
