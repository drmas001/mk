Treatment of the underlying cause may not lead to improvement in current symptoms but could prevent further progression. Otherwise, treatment of bronchiectasis focuses on airway clearance and preventing and treating exacerbations. This patient is experiencing a bronchiectasis exacerbation, which is often characterized as a change in sputum volume, viscosity, or purulence; increased cough; wheezing; shortness of breath; hemoptysis; or decline in lung function.
