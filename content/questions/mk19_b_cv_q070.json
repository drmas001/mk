Following delivery, patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy are treated the same as all other patients with heart failure. ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and should be used in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. ACE inhibitors can be started immediately in patients with acute heart failure in the absence of hyperkalemia; the estimated glomerular filtration rate should be monitored during uptitration. Enalapril, captopril, quinapril, and benazepril are present in very low levels in breast milk and are considered safe during breastfeeding. Valsartan-sacubitril should not be used during breastfeeding because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants."
