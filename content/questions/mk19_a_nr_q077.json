She has an acute ischemic stroke and is seen within 3 hours of onset of symptoms, which include the disabling neurologic feature of hemiparesis involving the left face, left arm and leg, and left-sided sensation. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score is 6. The patient does not have any absolute or relative exclusion criteria for thrombolysis, including recent surgery, prior or current intracranial hemorrhage, extensive hypodensity on imaging, or blood pressure above the target of 185/110 mm Hg. The benefits of intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke, including the lower likelihood of neurologic disability at 3 months poststroke, are generally thought to outweigh the small risk of hemorrhage."
