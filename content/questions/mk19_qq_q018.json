") is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Spinal stenosis results from narrowing of the spinal canal, usually due to degenerative arthritis of the spine that causes mechanical compression and ischemia of the lumbosacral spine nerve roots. Clinical manifestations of spinal stenosis are progressively worsening low back or buttock discomfort and severe leg pain (often bilateral but can be asymmetric) that is minimized when the low back is flexed (leading patients to lean forward) and worsened with spinal extension (such as when standing and walking up steps). Patients with chronic compressive myelopathy due to lumbar spinal stenosis may present with progressive leg weakness, spasticity, distal numbness, and bladder impairment. Diagnosis is supported by lumbar spine MRI. Notably, spinal stenosis may be incidentally detected in asymptomatic patients who have imaging for other reasons, and the degree of stenosis does not predict development of symptoms. Therefore, this finding alone does not require further evaluation in the absence of other signs or symptoms."

Its temporal course is often subacute with progression after 8 weeks of onset. This patient has normal reflexes, sensation, and motor strength. Finally, symptoms of CIDP would not change with changes in position."
