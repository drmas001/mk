"Patients who are at especially high risk for thrombosis while off anticoagulants may need a pre- or postoperative anticoagulant bridge with low-molecular-weight heparin to limit time off anticoagulation. This is most relevant for drugs with a delayed onset of action and longer half-life, such as warfarin. DOACs, however, have a rapid onset and short half-life; thus, bridging anticoagulation is not needed. The BRIDGE trial demonstrated no difference in thrombotic events in patients on warfarin with atrial fibrillation who were bridged perioperatively but did observe a higher rate of bleeding in this group. Therefore, bridging anticoagulation is rarely recommended, except in the setting of very high thrombosis risk off warfarin therapy, such as atrial fibrillation with a mechanical heart valve. This patient is not at very high risk for thrombosis and is not on warfarin; therefore, bridging is not warranted (",
