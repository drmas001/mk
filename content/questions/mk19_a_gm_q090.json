") is most likely responsible for this patient's adverse drug reaction. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are primarily known for their role in the oxidative metabolism of drugs. Both genetic and environmental factors can alter cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. Of the environmental factors, drug-drug interactions are the most relevant to clinicians. Of the genetic factors, significant pharmacokinetic alterations are most commonly caused by alleles in genes affecting the cytochrome P450 system, such as ",

". Clinical phenotypes of these genetic variations are assigned on the basis of enzyme activity: poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, extensive/normal metabolizer, rapid metabolizer, and ultrarapid metabolizer. The effect of the phenotype on a particular medication depends on whether the medication is an active drug or a prodrug. Levels of drugs taken in their active form are reduced in patients who are ultrarapid metabolizers and increased in patients who are poor metabolizers. Prodrugs require conversion to their active form; ultrarapid metabolizers will have increased drug levels, whereas poor metabolizers will have reduced levels. The most likely cause of this patient's altered mental status is codeine toxicity. He has evidence of opioid toxicity on physical examination, with miotic pupils and bradypnea that responded to naloxone. Codeine is a prodrug that is converted to morphine by the CYP2D6 enzyme; patients with a rapid or ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype, such as this patient, are at increased risk for toxicity. Intake of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as diltiazem, ketoconazole, or grapefruit, can also increase the risk for toxicity."
