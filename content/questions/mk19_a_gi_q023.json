In addition to continued intravenous fluid resuscitation, rapid identification of the bleeding source is essential. CTA is the study of choice in this setting because it can be performed quickly and has the greatest likelihood of localizing the site of bleeding (with an accuracy of nearly 100%). CTA can detect bleeding at a rate of 0.3 mL/min."

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a consideration in this patient taking aspirin and an NSAID. However, the presence of bilious fluid without blood following nasogastric tube lavage suggests that the pylorus is open and there is no active upper gastrointestinal bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz. In this patient, CTA is the preferred initial diagnostic test."
