"). GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety about activities or events (occupation, school) that a patient finds difficult to control and occurs more days than not for at least 6 months. The anxiety causes significant distress and functional impairment. Diagnosis requires the presence of three of the following physical symptoms: restlessness, being easily fatigued, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. Patients with significant anxiety or multiple unexplained physical symptoms should be screened for GAD using the GAD-7 screening tool. The shorter-form GAD-2 can be administered in less time and may be equivalent to the GAD-7 in screening for GAD in primary care populations. The GAD-2 asks patients how often they have been bothered by “feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge” and “not being able to stop or control worrying” over the previous 2 weeks."

ADHD is most frequently recognized in childhood, but the diagnosis may be delayed until adulthood. This patient's symptoms are related more to worry than inattention."
