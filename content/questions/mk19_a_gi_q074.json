"). This patient has acute cholecystitis. This condition is associated with severe right-upper-quadrant or epigastric pain lasting longer than 6 hours, accompanied by fever and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. A positive Murphy sign (inspiratory arrest during right-upper-quadrant palpation) may be seen on physical examination. Laboratory studies may show leukocytosis. Results of liver chemistries are not usually abnormal in acute cholecystitis unless choledocholithiasis is present. Acute cholecystitis can be diagnosed by ultrasonography showing gallbladder wall thickening and/or edema and a sonographic Murphy sign, elicited with compression of the right upper abdomen with the ultrasound probe. Treatment includes analgesia, intravenous antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage, and cholecystectomy before hospital discharge."

Common duct stones can be visualized on transabdominal ultrasonography, but in the absence of visualization, an elevated serum bilirubin level and dilated common duct on ultrasonography make the diagnosis likely. Cholangitis is suggested by fever, jaundice, and right-upper-quadrant abdominal pain. Cholangitis is potentially life-threatening; identified common bile duct stones should be removed urgently with ERCP, after which elective cholecystectomy should be performed during the initial hospitalization. This patient's laboratory and imaging findings do not suggest choledocholithiasis or cholangitis."
