"The most likely diagnosis is gastric angiodysplasia. Angiodysplasias are composed of ectatic, dilated, thin-walled vessels and may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, but they are most commonly reported in the colon. Other synonymous terms include arteriovenous malformation, angiectasia, and vascular ectasia. Telangiectasia may be used in the context of a hereditary disease, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Although the prevalence of angiodysplasia increases with age, and most cases are without a clear cause, associations of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia with advanced chronic kidney disease, von Willebrand disease, and aortic stenosis have been reported."
