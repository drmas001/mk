") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Unintentional weight loss occurs in 15% to 20% of elderly persons and is associated with increased risk for hospitalization, skilled nursing facility placement, and mortality. Some weight loss is expected with normal aging, but loss of more than 5% of body weight in a 6- to 12-month time period should be investigated. Malignancy, gastrointestinal disorders, and psychiatric conditions (including dementia) are the most common causes when a cause is identified. However, in 15% to 20% of patients, no cause is found. Recommended first-line treatment strategies in these patients include diet modification to address patient preferences and swallowing and chewing issues. This patient is edentulous; modification to a soft diet that does not require chewing would be appropriate. Other strategies of potential benefit include nutritional supplements (in addition to, rather than instead of, meals) and flavor enhancers. In patients in communal living situations, such as skilled nursing facilities, modification of the dining environment to resemble the home environment has been shown to improve caloric intake."
