"). The patient's new onset fever suggested the possibility of an infection. In the course of evaluating the infection, a urinalysis was obtained, which revealed pyuria. However, the presence of pyuria is a nonspecific finding, is not a symptom of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and should not be interpreted as an indication for antibiotic treatment. The next step should be to determine if the patient has any additional evidence-based symptoms of CAUTI such as hematuria, rigors, flank pain, pelvic discomfort, or suprapubic pain; after removal of the urinary catheter, the presence of urgency, frequency, or dysuria should be determined as well. This patient had no symptoms of CAUTI other than fever. The next question should be whether the patient had any other diagnosis that could account for the fever. In this case, the normal physical examination and stability of the vital signs other than temperature suggest that the fever could be a postoperative fever. Postoperative fever is mediated by cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-γ released following surgical stress. The median time to peak temperature is 11 hours, and half of patients have a temperature exceeding 38 °C (100.4 °F). Most fevers resulting from surgical stress resolve spontaneously after several hours; those related to surgery for severe trauma may persist for days."
