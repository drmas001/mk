"). According to the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on VTE prevention and treatment in patients with cancer, routine pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis should not be offered to all outpatients with cancer. Increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer is measured using the Khorana score. The guideline recommends that high-risk outpatients with cancer (Khorana score of 2 or higher before starting a new systemic chemotherapy regimen) may be offered thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) provided no significant risk factors for bleeding and no drug interactions are identified. Consideration of such therapy should be accompanied by a discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and harms, drug cost, and duration of prophylaxis in this setting. The Khorana score places highest risk of VTE on gastric and pancreatic cancers (2 points), with lymphoma and lung, gynecologic, bladder, and testicular cancers also being high risk (1 point). An additional point is given for BMI greater than 35, platelet count greater than 350,000/μL (350 × 10",

},
"). Data do not support the use of warfarin in the primary prophylaxis of VTE in patients with cancer. In those with cancer and active VTE disease, LMWH compared with warfarin was associated with a reduction in the rate of recurrent VTE at 6 months (9% vs 17%) and was not associated with an increased rate of major bleeding (6% vs 4%) or overall mortality (39% vs 41%). In patients with cancer, warfarin is not generally recommended for either primary VTE prophylaxis or treatment, although its use may be considered in patients with multiple myeloma at high risk who are treated with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide combined with other agents such as glucocorticoids, doxorubicin, or erythropoietin. In these patients, LMWH may be preferred."
