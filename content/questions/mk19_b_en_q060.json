"). This patient has a persistent 2-cm thyroid nodule previously evaluated by thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Thyroid nodule evaluation begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement; if it is normal or elevated, ultrasonography and FNAB are performed. Approximately 60% to 70% of biopsied nodules have benign cytology; 20% are indeterminate, and 5% to 10% have evidence of malignancy. Benign thyroid cytopathology results are associated with a 0% to 3% risk for malignancy. Repeat ultrasonography should be performed in 6 to 12 months for all high-suspicion nodules, 12 to 24 months for intermediate- and low-suspicion nodules, and 24 months or longer for very low-suspicion nodules."
