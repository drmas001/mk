Commercial airlines are required to pressurize cabins to the equivalent of approximately 2500 meters (~8200 feet) in altitude with occasional pressurization to an equivalent altitude of about 3000 meters (~10,000 feet) for short durations, if necessary, to accommodate flying conditions. People with normal cardiopulmonary function experience very little change in oxygenation at these altitudes. In patients whose baseline arterial P",
