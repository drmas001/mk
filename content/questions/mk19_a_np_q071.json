"), which has the highest sensitivity and specificity of all imaging options used in evaluating nephrolithiasis. The sensitivity of noncontrast helical abdominal CT for the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is greater than 95%. Noncontrast helical CT can also detect stones independent of their composition, with the exception of stones composed of indinavir crystals. Furthermore, noncontrast helical CT may be able to predict the composition of the stone based on the Hounsfield units. However, this should not preempt stone analysis. Finally, noncontrast helical CT potentially provides alternative diagnoses if nephrolithiasis is not detected."

IVP has high sensitivity for the diagnosis of hydronephrosis that might be caused by a stone but lacks the sensitivity and specificity of noncontrast helical CT in the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and potential diagnosis of stone type. When noncontrast helical CT is unavailable or contraindicated, kidney ultrasonography is preferred to IVP. Finally, IVP requires the use of intravenous contrast."

However, if noncontrast CT is unavailable or if the patient is pregnant, ultrasonography is the preferred method of evaluation."

Because of low cost and low amount of radiation, radiography is useful for following the movement and growth of a stone as well as monitoring total stone burden."
