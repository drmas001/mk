Patients often present with constitutional symptoms that include night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue, and splenomegaly is common; laboratory studies frequently show marked leukocytosis with a left shift, and basophilia and thrombocytosis can be seen. First-line treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as imatinib is considered accepted care for patients with CML in the chronic phase. TKIs bind to the BCR-ABL oncoprotein and prevent downstream signaling. Other TKIs include nilotinib and dasatinib. Availability of TKIs has dramatically changed outcomes in CML, with the 8-year overall survival in CML exceeding 90%."
