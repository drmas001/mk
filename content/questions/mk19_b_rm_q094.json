"). This patient has had classic inflammatory low back pain for several years. Flexion, external rotation, and abduction of the hips elicit pain in this patient's right hip as well as low back pain. These findings, along with involvement of the right hip, suggest ankylosing spondylitis (AS). This patient was diagnosed with uveitis. Spondyloarthritis accounts for approximately 40% of cases of acute anterior uveitis in the United States, and most of these patients will have AS. Acute anterior uveitis has been reported to affect 27% of patients with AS and rarely causes permanent visual damage."

According to Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria, HLA-B27 positivity would be helpful if the pelvis radiograph is normal in a patient with high likelihood of AS. The presence of back pain plus HLA-B27 positivity plus two other features of spondyloarthritis (in this case, uveitis and hip arthritis) would classify this patient's disease as an axial spondyloarthritis."

") can identify sacroiliac inflammation even in the absence of radiographic changes. However, 25% of healthy individuals can have MRI changes that meet criteria for sacroiliitis, and up to 41% of persons who regularly participate in impact-loading athletics may have similar MRI changes. The extent of involvement and presence of erosions on MRI increase the specificity of the result. However, plain radiography remains the cornerstone of radiographic diagnosis in spondyloarthritis and has sufficient specificity to confirm a diagnosis. Sacroiliitis shown by MRI is included in the ASAS classification criteria and would be useful if the plain radiograph was normal. In this case, checking HLA-B27 antigen would be more cost-effective for classification as an axial spondyloarthritis if the plain radiograph was normal. Plain radiography is the initial imaging choice in patients suspected of having AS because of its relatively low cost and safety."
