Deep tendon reflexes are preserved but exhibit delayed relaxation. Percussion over biceps muscles leads to formation of a raised muscular ridge. Gait has a waddling quality. Sensory examination and muscle tone are normal. Plantar responses are flexor. There are no involuntary movements."

"). The clinical presentation of proximal symmetric weakness, myalgia, and cramps without sensory loss or upper motor neuron signs is consistent with a myopathy. In this patient, the finding of muscle mounding after percussion (myoedema) strongly suggests hypothyroidism. The diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism is made by measuring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level and, if elevated, measuring the level of serum free thyroxine (T",

},
"). Clinical symptoms and signs can be nonspecific, often resulting in a delayed diagnosis. If asked, most patients do have muscular symptoms (stiffness, myalgias, cramps, easy fatigability), and muscle symptoms may be the predominant or the only clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism. If measured, serum creatine kinase is elevated in many patients with hypothyroidism, but the degree of elevation does not always correlate with the severity of muscle symptoms. Other features that may be seen with hypothyroid myopathy include goiter, ptosis, enlarged muscle bulk, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes (Woltman sign)."
