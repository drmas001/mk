"). This patient has symptomatic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with a normal heart on echocardiogram. Laboratory studies have excluded common secondary causes of PVCs (anemia, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy). The PVCs are likely contributing to her anxiety, which may in turn increase their number. β-Blockers, particularly those with some anxiolytic effect (such as propranolol), are first-line therapy for PVCs. β-Blockers are also preferred in patients with ventricular dysfunction. Among patients with depression or very poor tolerance of β-blockers, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, such as verapamil, may be used."

"This patient's PVC burden may be quite high if she has several PVCs on a standard 12-lead ECG.

Patients with PVCs that account for more than 10% to 15% of beats may be at risk for developing PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and subsequent heart failure, which is an additional reason to treat this patient's symptomatic PVCs. If she develops cardiomyopathy, it may be reversible with more aggressive treatment of PVCs (e.g., catheter ablation)."

However, it may be toxic over the long term, potentially causing devastating injury to the lungs, liver, and/or thyroid. Furthermore, it may be unnecessary in this young patient.

When amiodarone is used, it should be taken for the shortest possible time at the lowest effective dose, with close monitoring."
