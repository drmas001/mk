"Most nodular melanomas are smooth, but others are eroded and have a particularly poor prognosis. Nodular melanomas grow rapidly (fulfilling the Evolution diagnostic criterion), particularly vertical growth, and are more aggressive than other subtypes. Because of the increased thickness of the melanoma at diagnosis and aggressive behavior, prompt identification, biopsy, and treatment are imperative. All suspicious pigmented lesions must be biopsied. The preferred method to biopsy a pigmented lesion is an excisional biopsy with a 1- to 3-mm margin to obtain the entire lesion and prevent sampling error."

After its rapid growth, some keratoacanthomas tend to involute in 6 months. Because keratoacanthomas are difficult to differentiate from squamous cell carcinoma, they are often treated with surgical excision. The lack of a keratin-filled center and uniform black pigmentation of this patient's skin lesion differentiates it from a keratoacanthoma."
