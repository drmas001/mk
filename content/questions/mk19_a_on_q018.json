") to look for evidence of transformation. This patient's clinical picture with rapid growth in a single nodal area with disproportionately higher PET standardized uptake values (SUVs) is suggestive of transformation of his low-grade follicular lymphoma to a more aggressive phenotype, typically to diffuse large cell lymphoma. Other features that can suggest transformation include new onset of B symptoms, declining performance status, marked rise in lactate dehydrogenase, hypercalcemia, and the development of new sites of extranodal disease. SUV on PET scan over 17 is strongly suggestive of transformation, but lower SUV levels cannot reliably rule in or rule out transformation, so biopsy is necessary if there is clinical concern based on other features."

"Transformation of low-grade follicular lymphoma to diffuse large cell lymphoma may occur in about one third of patients over time. Transformation has important prognostic and therapeutic implications, as such events indicate a worse prognosis and require more aggressive therapy. If his lymphoma has undergone transformation to a higher grade of disease, combination anthracycline-based chemotherapy, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and in some cases, CD19-targerted CAR-T cell therapy would be a treatment option."
