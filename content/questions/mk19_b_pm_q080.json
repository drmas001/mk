"A 54-year-old man is evaluated during a follow-up visit for asthma. He has a 5-year history of persistent asthma. He has had one exacerbation within the last year, which was treated with glucocorticoids. He reports no wheezing but notes an intermittent nonproductive cough. His Asthma Control Test score is 24, indicating well-controlled asthma. He reports adherence to his maintenance inhaler and demonstrates good inhaler technique. He describes symptoms of epigastric burning following meals. He has no other gastrointestinal symptoms. He does not smoke, and he exercises daily without limitation. Medications are fluticasone-salmeterol 100/50 μg and an albuterol inhaler."

"). The patient has a normal Asthma Control Test score, normal spirometry, and normal fractional exhaled nitric oxide, which all confirm that his asthma is well controlled. Measurement of the fraction of nitric oxide in an exhaled breath sample provides a noninvasive way to quantify eosinophilic airway inflammation and serves as a complementary tool in the diagnosis and management of asthma. However, his cough and other symptoms suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a common asthma comorbidity. At each asthma visit, clinicians should assess patient symptom control, inhaler technique and adherence, and comorbidities such as rhinosinusitis, obesity, and GERD. GERD is more common in patients with asthma than the general population and may contribute to respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. Potential mechanisms by which GERD may cause cough or worsened asthma control include increased vagal tone, bronchial hyperreactivity, and microaspiration of gastric contents into the upper airways. Empiric treatment of GERD in patients without worrisome symptoms such as weight loss, dysphagia, or hematemesis consists of a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole."
