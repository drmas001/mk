"A 73-year-old woman is evaluated for progressive left arm weakness. One year earlier, she noted difficulty with fine movements of her left hand. Within a few months, her entire left upper extremity became stiff and slow, such that she now cannot use this limb. Her left leg has also become rigid. She notes brief jerky movements of her left arm. She takes no medication."

"On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Language and memory are intact, but she speaks slowly and has difficulty with multistep commands. Results of cranial nerve testing, including extraocular movements, are normal. Muscle strength is preserved throughout. Her left upper and lower extremities are rigid and slow. Her left hand is forced into a bent position and cannot be opened by the examiner. She needs support during ambulation because of stiffness of her left leg. Her sensory perception is preserved, but she cannot identify an object placed into her left hand when her eyes are closed. Cerebellar examination findings, plantar response, and deep tendon reflexes are unremarkable."

Corticobasal degeneration is characterized by severely asymmetric parkinsonism, fixed dystonia, myoclonus, cortical sensory deficits, apraxia, and cognitive deficits. Parkinson-plus syndromes share some features of Parkinson disease but are distinguished by faster progression than in Parkinson disease, additional features that are atypical for Parkinson disease, and lack of typical response to levodopa. This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with corticobasal degeneration. Both symmetry and extreme asymmetry of clinical deficits are among the red flags for atypical Parkinson-plus syndromes."
