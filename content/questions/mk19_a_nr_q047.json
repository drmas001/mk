"). The patient is seen 24 hours after sudden onset of severe headache (thunderclap headache). Thunderclap headache is defined as a severe attack of headache pain developing abruptly and reaching maximum intensity within 1 minute. Although occasionally of primary origin, thunderclap headache is a medical emergency that warrants immediate diagnostic evaluation. Thunderclap headache has a broad differential diagnosis; the most serious is aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A small proportion (less than 5%) of patients with aneurysmal SAH will have a CT scan of the head that is negative for bleeding and require a lumbar puncture to rule out this condition. In patients with SAH, results on lumbar puncture performed 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset will reveal elevated erythrocyte counts and xanthochromia (yellow color caused by breakdown of red blood cells). If lumbar puncture is performed within 12 hours of symptom onset, it may be challenging to distinguish a traumatic process from the acute presence of erythrocytes from aneurysmal bleeding because xanthochromia may not yet have developed."

") is not appropriate because SAH has not been confirmed and an invasive diagnostic test is not yet indicated. If evidence suggests SAH, vascular imaging is indicated to first evaluate for an aneurysm; usually this is done with a less invasive test, such as CT angiography. Noninvasive vascular imaging will also allow for evaluation of other causes of thunderclap headache, such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). RCVS manifests as multifocal distal arterial narrowing on imaging."
