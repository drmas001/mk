Headaches previously occurred four to five times per month but now occur 16 to 20 times per month and last 12 to 24 hours. The headaches are bilateral, throbbing, moderate in intensity, aggravated by physical activity, and accompanied by photophobia and phonophobia. He has had no other associated symptoms. The patient takes amitriptyline and sumatriptan for the headaches and has been taking sumatriptan four to five times weekly for the past 3 months."

"). The patient has a history of headaches meeting criteria for episodic migraine and has likely now developed medication overuse headache (MOH). MOH is defined as headache occurring on at least 15 days per month in a patient with a pre-existing headache disorder exposed to regular overuse for more than 3 months of one or more drugs taken for acute and/or symptomatic treatment of headache. Use of triptans, ergot alkaloids, opioids, or combination analgesics for 10 or more days per month or simple analgesics for 15 or more days per month constitutes medication overuse. Affected patients often report daily or near-daily headache that is refractory to numerous treatments. MOH is more common in midlife, in women, and in persons with high baseline headache frequency. The development of MOH often coincides with the transformation of episodic forms of migraine or tension-type headache (occurring <15 days per month) into their chronic subtypes (15 or more days monthly). Treatment of MOH is to wean overused acute medications, initiate migraine preventive medication, and provide new acute medications limited in use to 10 or fewer days per month."
