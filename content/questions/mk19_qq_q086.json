An unenhanced CT can show gallstones and a hyperdense gallbladder wall, which can suggest the presence of gangrenous cholecystitis. However, CT is expensive and exposes the patient to ionizing radiation. It is generally reserved to resolve diagnostic dilemmas and to detect possible complications of acute cholecystitis, such as generalized peritonitis, sepsis, or bowel obstruction."

If the gallbladder is not visualized within 60 minutes, delayed images are obtained after 4 hours. In patients who are critically ill, morphine may be administered to increase sphincter of Oddi pressure and to reduce the likelihood of false-positive results."
