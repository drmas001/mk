"). Physicians may be reluctant to report colleagues suspected of impairment because of discomfort associated with “speaking up,” fears of retaliation, and desire to protect colleagues. However, physicians have a duty to speak up because an impaired and disruptive colleague's behaviors may harm patients, negatively affect team morale, and impede learning. This physician's colleague manifests multiple behaviors suggestive of impairment, including altered mood, lapses in judgment, and changes in clinical performance. Because the physician has already directly confronted the colleague and the concerns were dismissed, the physician should report the impaired colleague to the appropriate supervisor, such as a chief of service, chief of staff, institutional or medical society assistance program, or state medical board."
