"). Achalasia is associated with dysphagia with both solids and liquids, along with nonacidic regurgitation of undigested food. Additional symptoms include heartburn, weight loss, and chest pain unresponsive to acid-reducing agents. It can be idiopathic or associated with viral, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders and infection (e.g., Chagas disease). The initial diagnostic test is barium esophagography or upper endoscopy, which shows dilation of the esophagus with narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction. In classic achalasia, esophageal manometry shows incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and aperistalsis; however, not all patients with conditions on the spectrum of achalasia-type disorders have these classic findings. Upper endoscopy reveals retained food and saliva, no signs of mechanical obstruction, and “tightness” at the gastroesophageal junction while the scope is advanced into the stomach. Treatment of achalasia aims to decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure, which relieves symptoms. Treatments include botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic balloon dilation, peroral endoscopic myotomy, or laparoscopic myotomy. Choice of therapy depends on patient factors, type of disease, and available local expertise."
