He also takes aripiprazole and receives psychotherapy. He reports no improvement in his symptoms, which do not include mania or hypomania. He has not had suicidal ideation. He has no other medical conditions and takes no other medications."

"). This patient, who has severe major depressive disorder that is unresponsive to maximal combination oral therapy with a second-generation antidepressant (SGA) and an antipsychotic agent as well as psychotherapy, is a candidate for intranasal esketamine. Intranasal esketamine is approved as an adjunct to oral antidepressant agents for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. Esketamine is a glutamate receptor modulator, which offers a novel mechanism of action for depression treatment. Unlike most other antidepressant therapies, treatment effect is almost immediate; however, there are several barriers to its use. Labeling indications restrict the drug to patients whose symptoms have failed to respond to two courses of appropriately prescribed antidepressant therapy, and patients cannot drive or operate machinery for 24 hours after administration. Esketamine must be administered intranasally in a physician's office under direct supervision, and physicians must be enrolled in an FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program. Esketamine carries a black box warning for dissociation, sedation, and suicidal thoughts. The cost of the month-long induction is very expensive."
