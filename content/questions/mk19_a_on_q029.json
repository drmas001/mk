"). Fertility is a key survivorship issue for young patients with cancer. Premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive chemotherapy are at risk of chemotherapy-induced menopause and infertility. Alkylating chemotherapy agents (including cyclophosphamide) are known to be gonadotoxic and are included in most adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer. The risk of gonadotoxicity depends on age with very young women (age <35 years) having a low risk of permanent menopause from chemotherapy. All premenopausal women receiving chemotherapy should be counseled on the risk of permanent menopause and infertility associated with chemotherapy and the availability of fertility preservation options. Fertility counseling in this situation is associated with improved psychosocial outcomes. Oocyte and embryo cryopreservation involves ovarian stimulation followed by collection of oocytes, which are then cryopreserved as oocytes or as embryos. Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation may be performed before starting chemotherapy and does not appear to be associated with worse breast cancer outcomes. Aromatase inhibitors are often used during ovarian stimulation in this setting to prevent an increase in estradiol levels. Cryopreservation of oocytes/embryos usually takes 2 to 3 weeks leading to minimal or short delays in care. This is the gold-standard approach for fertility preservation, although it does not guarantee the ability to conceive in the future."
