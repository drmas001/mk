"). This patient most likely has primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is typically a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunodeficiency, including HIV infection, is the most consistent risk factor, but PCNSL incidence is increasing in older, immunocompetent patients. On MRI, PCNSL appears as a single, well-demarcated, deep white matter (periventricular) lesion with minimal to no mass effect or edema. The finding of lymphomatous cells in vitreous or cerebrospinal fluid samples (identified by cytology and flow cytometry) may obviate the need for biopsy. When these less invasive diagnostic measures are negative, brain biopsy should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis."

Furthermore, unless there is impending risk of death from herniation, glucocorticoids should be avoided prior to biopsy in cases of suspected PCNSL; glucocorticoids are known to temporarily suppress lymphoma, leading to false-negative biopsy results, delays in diagnosis, and possibly a negative effect on outcomes."
