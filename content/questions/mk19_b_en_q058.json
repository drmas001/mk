"). Adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes related to diabetes mellitus increase with worsening hyperglycemia. Complications include macrosomia, labor and delivery complications, preeclampsia, neonatal hypoglycemia, spontaneous abortion, and intrauterine fetal demise. Many women with gestational diabetes are able to meet glycemic targets with a lowâ€“glycemic-index diet and reduced carbohydrate intake. However, when the glycemic targets of less than 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L) fasting and less than 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) 2 hours after a meal are not achieved with therapeutic lifestyle modifications, medical therapy should be initiated to improve perinatal outcomes. Insulin is the preferred therapy in gestational diabetes because it does not cross the placenta to the same degree as other medications. Basal insulin (insulin detemir or neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] based on their established safety in pregnancy) should be used to treat fasting hyperglycemia, whereas rapid-acting insulins, such as insulin aspart or insulin lispro, are best to treat postprandial glycemic excursions."

Metformin also crosses the placenta freely and may increase the risk for preterm labor. The long-term safety data for metformin in pregnancy are unclear; thus, metformin is not recommended as first-line therapy for patients with gestational diabetes. Other oral and noninsulin injectable glucose-lowering medications also lack long-term safety data."
