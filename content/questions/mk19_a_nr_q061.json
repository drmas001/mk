"A 67-year-old woman is evaluated in the ICU. She is unresponsive. Three days ago, she was admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to community-acquired pneumonia and was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Prior to intubation, neurologic examination was normal. Antibiotics and propofol were initiated. Twelve hours ago, the propofol was discontinued, but the patient remains unresponsive. Medical history is significant for hypertension and previous right hemispheric stroke without residual deficits. Prehospitalization medications were aspirin, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide; current medications include ceftriaxone, azithromycin."

"). This patient has coma of unexplained etiology, and left-sided extremity twitching. In this patient with altered mental status and continuous focal motor seizures in the setting of critical illness, the diagnosis is most likely nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). NCSE should be suspected when a patient, particularly a critically ill patient, has altered mental status with an unclear cause. NCSE is characterized as electrical seizure activity without clinically evident seizure activity. Patients with NCSE may manifest rhythmic twitching of one or more muscle groups but these findings are often subtle and can be missed. NCSE requires continuous (24-hour) EEG confirmation for diagnosis."

However, in this case, empiric treatment would not help ascertain the cause of the otherwise unexplained coma. In general, expert opinion recommends that an effort should be made to diagnose NCSE as quickly as possible but with minimal sedation, so as to avoid inducing or prolonging coma and intubation."
