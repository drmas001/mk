"). Menopause is a clinical diagnosis made retrospectively when a woman has not experienced a menstrual period for 12 months. Menopause occurring in women older than 40 years, such as this patient, requires no additional laboratory or diagnostic evaluation. Menopause occurring in women younger than 40 years should be evaluated for premature ovarian insufficiency and other disorders by obtaining follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin levels; on the basis of results of these studies, additional evaluation may be required. Symptoms of menopause include vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats). Hot flushes generally start in the perimenopausal period and can last for a few years to lifelong. Women may experience other symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and irritability, but it is unclear whether these symptoms can be attributed to menopause. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause results from estrogen deficiency and is characterized by vaginal symptoms, such as burning or irritation; sexual symptoms, such as dyspareunia or sexual dysfunction; or urinary symptoms, such as dysuria or recurrent urinary infections."
