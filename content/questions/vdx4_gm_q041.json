"This patient has an erosive cervical lesion that is most consistent with carcinoma of the cervix. The most common signs of cervical cancer are vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods or after menopause, postcoital vaginal bleeding, and abnormal vaginal discharge. Direct examination usually shows an abnormal cervix, although a tumor in the cervical canal may be difficult to see. The diagnosis is usually established by punch biopsy of obvious lesions or by colposcopy with directed biopsy."
