"). CTEPH consists of organized, chronic thrombi within the pulmonary arterial system. Patients with CTEPH demonstrate both mechanical obstruction of pulmonary arteries and features of disordered pulmonary angiogenesis, fibrinolysis, and vascular remodeling. These changes manifest in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure. Untreated, CTEPH can lead to right-sided heart failure and death. Lifelong anticoagulation to help prevent further thromboembolism and consideration of thromboendarterectomy are indicated for CTEPH. The only potentially curative therapy for CTEPH is pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Because the disease is usually progressive, surgical evaluation at an experienced center is warranted in all patients with CTEPH, regardless of disease severity. Approximately half of patients with CTEPH will be eligible for surgery. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy can result in normalization of pulmonary hemodynamics in about one third of patients who undergo surgery."

") may be appropriate for some nonoperative patients. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty is an emerging field. A catheter-directed balloon is inserted into the pulmonary artery and inflated to improve blood flow and reduce vascular resistance within the pulmonary circulation. Neither riociguat nor balloon pulmonary angioplasty should be offered before considering surgical intervention. In patients with inoperable CTEPH and those who have persistent pulmonary hypertension following thromboendarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty or medical therapy with riociguat should be considered."
