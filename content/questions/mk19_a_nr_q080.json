Her current medication is lamotrigine at maximum dose, which she tolerates well with no adverse effects."

"). Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Based on the symptoms described, this patient most likely has focal impaired awareness seizures (formerly known as focal dyscognitive seizures or complex partial seizures) of temporal lobe origin. She has drug-resistant epilepsy, having ongoing seizures despite treatment with two tolerated, appropriately chosen, and adequately dosed antiepileptic medications (whether as monotherapy or in combination). The patient should be referred to an epilepsy center for video EEG monitoring to confirm the diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy and evaluate her for epilepsy surgery. Mesial temporal sclerosis with hippocampal atrophy is the most common cause of drug-resistant adult-onset focal epilepsy. Therefore, brain MRI is also an appropriate next step because surgical candidacy requires confirmation that seizure manifestations on video EEG match the location of pathology on MRI or other advanced functional imaging (single-photon emission CT or PET). These steps are required to determine if the patient can be considered for temporal lobectomy."
