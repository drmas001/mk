"). He has poststroke fatigue, which is highly prevalent (23% to 77%) in survivors of stroke and can significantly affect recovery, rehabilitation, and quality of life. There is likely a neuroanatomic and physiologic basis for poststroke fatigue; however, reversible causes need to be identified and treated first. Sleep-disordered breathing after stroke is highly prevalent (50% to 70%) and may not necessarily present with symptoms of snoring or be purely obstructive. Treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in stroke patients can reduce poststroke fatigue and cognitive impairment. Certain strokes may be more likely to lead to sleep-disordered breathing, including those involving the brainstem (such as in this patient); a normal BMI does not rule out sleep-disordered breathing."

In this patient, however, reversible causes such as sleep-disordered breathing have not yet been investigated."
