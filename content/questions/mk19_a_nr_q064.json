"A 60-year-old woman is evaluated for constant movements of her tongue and lips that she cannot suppress. She also has difficulty with keeping her jaw closed, and food spills out of her mouth during meals. The movements started 2 years ago following treatment with metoclopramide for diabetic gastroparesis. She stopped the medication, but movements persisted. Medical history is also significant for panic disorder. She has no history of depression and no family history of abnormal movements or dementia. Current medications are metformin, sitagliptin, canagliflozin, and clonazepam."

She cannot keep her mouth open more than a few seconds because of forced closure of the jaw, with associated hyperactivity of the masseter muscles. Minimal writhing finger flexion movements are noted during ambulation."

" receptor antagonists used as antipsychotic or antiemetic and prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. All patients receiving these agents must be warned about the risk for this complication. First step in management should be removal of the offending drug, as was done in this patient. If dyskinesia persists and causes functional or social impairment, treatment with a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor, such as valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, or tetrabenazine, can be helpful. Potential adverse effects include sedation, depression, and suicidality; patients should be monitored closely for psychiatric side effects. In trials, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine have shown a lower rate of psychiatric adverse effects compared with tetrabenazine. Other options include amantadine, clonazepam, and, in the case of tardive dystonia, botulinum toxin injection. In refractory cases, deep-brain stimulation can be beneficial."
