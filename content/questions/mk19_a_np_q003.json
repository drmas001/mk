") should be performed to screen for lung cancer in this patient newly diagnosed with phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)-negative membranous nephropathy (MN) and a history of heavy tobacco use. Testing for PLA2R antigen is used to help distinguish primary from secondary forms of MN. This distinction is crucial because secondary (PLA2R antigen–negative) forms are expected to remit if the underlying systemic disease responsible for the lesion is successfully treated. Therefore, age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening is recommended for all patients at the time of diagnosis, even those with PLA2R positivity. Thus, the initial step in management of newly diagnosed MN is to evaluate for secondary forms of the disease, which account for approximately 25% of MN cases and include lupus-, hepatitis-, drug-, and malignancy-associated forms of MN. Cancer screening is particularly important in evaluating for secondary forms of MN in patients >65 years of age. Up to 25% of such patients will have a malignancy discovered within 1 year of diagnosis. This 69-year-old man with a 45-pack-year history of smoking has not undergone risk factor–appropriate cancer screening, which would include a noncontrast CT of the chest."
