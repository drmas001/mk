") gene. PJS is a hamartomatous polyposis syndrome, and PJS-type polyps are found primarily in the small bowel as well as the stomach and colon. Small-bowel hamartomas develop at a young age (average age, 18.5 years), and patients may present with rectal bleeding (most commonly), bowel obstruction, and intussusception. A clinical diagnosis of PJS may be made when two of the following three criteria are met: two or more PJS-type hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract; typical mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation (melanotic macules) in the mouth, buccal mucosa, nose, eyes, genitalia, or fingers; and family history of PJS. Patients with PJS have increased lifetime risk for multiple malignancies: colorectal (39%), gastric (29%), small bowel (13%), breast (32%-54%), ovarian/sex cord tumor with annular tubules (21%), cervical/adenoma malignum (1%), uterine (9%), testicular/Sertoli cell tumor (9%), lung (7%-17%), and pancreatic (11%-36%). The multiple melanotic macules present on this patient's lips are not seen in other familial polyposis syndromes. It is important to recognize that people without PJS may also have melanotic macules, most commonly on the lower lip, but macules may also be found on the gingiva, buccal mucosa, or tongue or within the genital mucosa. Solitary lesions are the rule, but multiple lesions suggest PJS."
