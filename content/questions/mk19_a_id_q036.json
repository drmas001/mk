". This type of recurrent UTI is defined by three culture-positive infections in the previous 12 months or two infections within 6 months. Contributing factors for reinfection in premenopausal women include sexual activity, diaphragm and spermicide use, delayed urinary habits, and douching. Diminished estrogen levels and, to a lesser extent, increases in residual bladder urine volume and incontinence play much larger roles in UTIs in postmenopausal women. Episodic self-diagnosis and treatment with a first-line, short-course regimen such as nitrofurantoin is an appropriate initial strategy. Single-dose, postcoital antibiotics are effective in reducing bladder infections if infection is temporally related to coitus; avoidance of spermicides has also proven beneficial."
