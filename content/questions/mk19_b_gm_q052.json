He drinks artificially sweetened soda daily and one alcoholic beverage most evenings with dinner. He does not smoke cigarettes. He lives alone and does not maintain social relationships and describes himself as lonely. Depression screening is negative."

"). There is increasing evidence supporting loneliness and specifically social isolation as risk factors for cardiovascular disease and death. A study of over 450,000 patients demonstrated that social isolation was associated with a 1.43 (95% CI, 1.3-1.55) increased risk for incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.25-1.54) increased risk for stroke. Some, but not all, of these effects were attenuated by correction for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Social isolation was also associated with a 25% increase in mortality after AMI and a 32% increase in mortality after stroke."

"This patient's level of alcohol consumption (",

") is considered lower risk. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines indicate that adults should limit consumption of alcohol to no more than one drink per day for nonpregnant women and two drinks per day for men. Studies have shown that this amount of alcohol consumption may reduce the risk for MI. However, it is generally agreed that individuals who prefer not to drink alcohol should not initiate alcohol consumption for the purposes of cardiovascular risk reduction."

"This patient's consumption of artificially sweetened soda (",
{
"type":"tag",

") is unlikely to be a significant contributor to cardiovascular risk. The effect of artificial sweeteners on health is uncertain. Some studies indicate that artificial sweeteners may cause weight gain and have effects on bowel health and the gut microbiome. Although artificial sweeteners have been associated with increased risk for cancer in animal models, the association has not been found in humans. Artificially sweetened beverages are often recommended as a transition from sugar-sweetened beverages to water and can also decrease dental caries in these cases."

") is unlikely to be a significant contributor to cardiovascular risk. Many studies have shown that frequent consumption of red meat results in a modest increased risk for cancer; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; and, in some studies, mortality. Effect sizes are generally small and inconsistent, and no randomized controlled trial data confirm this. This patient's red meat consumption is quite minimal and is unlikely to contribute to cardiovascular risk."
