His disease converted to a secondary progressive course 4 years ago, and 2.5 years ago, he became nonambulatory. His only medication is interferon-beta 1b."

") in this patient. His multiple sclerosis (MS) would be characterized currently as secondary progressive with progression but no activity. American Academy of Neurology guidelines recommend discontinuation of all disease-modifying therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS who have been nonambulatory for more than 2 years and who have had no relapsing activity during that same period. This patient has been nonambulatory for more than 2 years, has no evidence of MS activity within the past 2 years on a recent MRI, and has not had any relapses for 6 years. This recommendation is based on data from clinical trials in patients with progressive forms of MS that show a lack of benefit from disease-modifying drugs in patients of any age with high degrees of disability and no relapsing activity. Additionally, patients older than 65 years are more prone to infectious complications from disease-modifying therapy, which results in a risk-to-benefit ratio that does not favor treatment."
