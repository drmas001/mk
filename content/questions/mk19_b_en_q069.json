Combined oral contraceptive therapy was prescribed along with weight loss. She has been adherent to this treatment and now has monthly withdrawal vaginal bleeding; she also has lost 4.5 kg (10.0 lb). She has had some improvement in hair growth but is not completely satisfied."

"). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. PCOS affects 6% to 10% of women and is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility in women. It is associated with rapid gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulses, an excess of luteinizing hormone, and insufficient follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, resulting in excessive ovarian androgen production and ovulatory dysfunction. PCOS is accompanied by insulin resistance. Elevated insulin levels in PCOS further enhance ovarian and adrenal androgen production, as well as increase bioavailability of androgens related to a reduction in sex hormone-binding globulin. PCOS is associated with increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. This patient with PCOS has evidence of ongoing hirsutism (i.e., dark coarse hair on the face, chest, back, arms/legs) and acne despite 6 months of oral contraceptive therapy. The next step is to add an antiandrogen agent to oral contraceptive therapy. Spironolactone is the most commonly used antiandrogen agent and is generally safe and well tolerated. Potential adverse effects include hyperkalemia (rare in patients with normal renal function), gastrointestinal discomfort, and irregular menstrual bleeding. In women prescribed spironolactone, concomitant contraception is mandatory because of teratogenesis in male fetuses."
