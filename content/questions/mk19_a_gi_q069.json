"A 65-year-old woman is evaluated at a follow-up visit. She presented to the emergency department 2 weeks ago with a 2-day history of left-lower-quadrant abdominal pain. CT revealed diverticulitis and a 15-mm cystic structure in the body of the pancreas. She was discharged on oral antibiotics and now feels well. Colonoscopy is scheduled in 6 weeks. She has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. The radiology report indicates that the pancreatic cyst has all the imaging features of a serous cystadenoma."

"). Characteristic findings of serous cystadenomas include multicystic, lobulated structures (sometimes described as a “bunch of grapes”), which may have a central fibrosis scar or calcification. Pancreatic cysts are being detected more frequently because of increased use of imaging and improved imaging techniques; these cysts may be found in 15% of individuals undergoing abdominal imaging. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are subcategorized as mucin-producing and non–mucin-producing cysts. Mucin-producing cysts, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms, are thought to have malignant potential, but many never become malignant. Non–mucin-producing cysts, such as a serous cystadenoma, have no malignant potential and can often be identified by their characteristic imaging features. These cysts require no further evaluation unless symptomatic."

") of high-risk cysts is the only treatment option. In addition to the high-risk features just described, cysts in patients presenting with obstructive jaundice are also high risk. Surgical resection is recommended for nearly all mucinous neoplasms and main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms if the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate. Mucinous cystic neoplasms occur almost exclusively in women in their fifth to seventh decades of life and are almost always located in the body or tail of the pancreas. These neoplasms have moderate malignant potential. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are equally prevalent in men and women, usually appearing in their fifth to seventh decades of life. Branch-duct IPMNs are characterized by cystic structures that may appear throughout the pancreas. Imaging characteristics of main duct IPMNs include main pancreatic duct dilation and parenchymal atrophy. These neoplasms have variable malignant potential."
