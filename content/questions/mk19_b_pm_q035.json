"). The patient most likely has sepsis or septic shock based on a source of infection, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mentation. Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and treatment with fluid resuscitation begins immediately. Guidelines recommend that in the resuscitation from sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, at least 30 mL/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluid be given within the first 3 hours with a balanced crystalloid solution such as lactated Ringer solution rather than 0.9% saline. A large 2018 clinical trial demonstrated that among critically ill adults, the use of a balanced crystalloid solution for intravenous fluid administration resulted in a lower rate of the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction than the use of 0.9% saline, with an absolute difference of 1.1%."

Although prespecified subgroup analyses in two of the trials initially suggested that albumin may improve survival over crystalloids in patients with septic shock, more recent meta-analyses suggest otherwise. Because albumin is significantly more expensive than crystalloid solutions, it is not recommended for routine use in resuscitation of patients with septic shock. Intravenous albumin may be considered in patients requiring large volumes of intravenous fluid during resuscitation."
