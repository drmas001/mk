"). During the perioperative period, patients with cirrhosis are at significantly greater risk for electrolyte abnormalities, fluid imbalance, delirium, kidney failure, worsening liver dysfunction, impaired clearance of medications, infection, bleeding, clotting, and death. The likelihood of poor outcomes increases with the extent of liver disease as measured by Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) or Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. The MELD score incorporates the INR, serum total bilirubin level, and serum creatinine levels. A progressive increase in perioperative mortality for all procedures is observed as MELD scores rise. Patients who have MELD scores below 8 to 10 generally do well perioperatively provided that their liver disease is stable and compensated, and it is reasonable to proceed with most surgeries with optimal medical management. When a MELD score is greater than 20, mortality rates increase to a degree that precludes all but the most urgent surgeries for life-threatening illness. A MELD score of 14 (as this patient has) indicates intermediate risk for surgery-related complications, and the risks and benefits of the anticipated elective surgery should be discussed with the patient after the perioperative evaluation."
