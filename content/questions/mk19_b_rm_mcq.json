"). Behçet syndrome is a systemic vasculitis characterized by recurrent oral aphthae. Other manifestations include genital aphthae, ocular disease, skin lesions, gastrointestinal involvement, neurologic disease, vascular disease, and arthritis. The treatment of oral and genital ulcers is guided by the severity of symptoms and the presence of other disease manifestations. This patient's disease does not seem to be responding adequately to colchicine, which is an appropriate first-line therapy for mucocutaneous ulcerations. Hence, an alternate or additional treatment should be tried. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved for treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and prevention of oral ulcers in Behçet syndrome. It is a reasonable alternative to colchicine as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent for patients with recurrent oral ulcers. Apremilast must be started at a low dose and uptitrated over a few days to achieve a maintenance dosage of 30 mg twice daily. Clinical trial data also suggest a positive impact on genital ulcers, with a trend toward improvement, but the studies were not powered to assess this outcome. Apremilast is usually well tolerated but is associated with adverse events, such as diarrhea, nausea, and headache. It should be used cautiously in patients with depression. Systemic glucocorticoids in tapering doses can be used in patients who are refractory to colchicine and apremilast. However, if the patient requires continued systemic glucocorticoid therapy, azathioprine, thalidomide, or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors are most appropriate."

" gene. This gene encodes pyrin, a protein important to the production and/or overproduction of interleukin-1β. Although the genetics continue to be studied, from a clinical point of view the disease is most commonly found in Jewish, Arab, and Turkish populations and follows an autosomal recessive pattern. Other symptoms may include other forms of serositis, including pericarditis. During episodes, inflammatory markers are elevated; in between episodes the physical examination and laboratory results may be normal. Diagnosis is made clinically and can be confirmed definitively in most patients through genetic testing. One long-term consequence of the episodic inflammation of FMF is amyloidosis, including of the kidneys; this patient's low-level proteinuria may be an early manifestation. Other autoinflammatory syndromes are rarer and have similar but nonidentical features that allow them to be distinguished from FMF.

Each of these is assigned 1 point except for current psoriasis, which is assigned 2 points. These criteria are 91% sensitive and 98% specific for the diagnosis of PsA if 3 or more points are present.

The disease course began with nonspecific symptoms but progressed to involve the upper and lower airways, eyes, skin, and kidneys. The skin rash, glomerulonephritis, and nodular lung disease are consistent with a vasculitic process. In GPA with kidney involvement, kidney biopsy is expected to show pathognomonic findings of pauci-immune crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Whenever possible, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of GPA with tissue pathology before beginning treatment, given the many risks that accompany intensive immunosuppression; prognostic data can help guide therapy as well. Guideline-directed initial therapy for active, severe GPA is either intravenous pulse glucocorticoids or high-dose oral glucocorticoids plus rituximab (preferred) or cyclophosphamide. If the diagnosis is clear and urgent treatment is necessary, however, biopsy may be bypassed (in this case, for example, if the ANCA panel were positive and the patient were more acutely ill)."

This patient has inflammatory low back pain manifesting as night pain, morning stiffness, and pain that improves with activity. He also has enthesitis of the Achilles tendon, which is seen in spondyloarthritis. A positive HLA-B27 antigen test result in the setting of a compelling clinical picture confirms the diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis. If the HLA-B27 antigen result is negative, MRI of the pelvis to evaluate for sacroiliac joint inflammation is warranted. In a patient with inflammatory low back pain and a positive HLA-B27 antigen result but no other features of spondyloarthritis, MRI is also indicated. In general, HLA-B27 antigen testing adds probabilistic certainty to the evaluation of low back pain.

An isolated positive ANA result with nonspecific symptoms and normal clinical examination does not establish the diagnosis of a connective tissue disease. In a patient with findings strongly suggesting an underlying rheumatologic disease, such as this patient with features of SLE, ANA testing is appropriate. ANA testing should be done before any subserology testing. If the ANA test result is positive, then specific subserologies are indicated on the basis of the clinical scenario.

Anti-Smith antibodies are the most specific for SLE (99%) but have low sensitivity. Antibody levels do not correlate with disease activity. Anti–U1-ribonucleoprotein antibodies (particularly high titers) are sensitive for mixed connective tissue disease. Antibody levels do not correlate with disease activity. In patients with SLE, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies are associated with photosensitive rash. In addition, offspring of mothers who are positive for anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB are at increased risk for neonatal lupus erythematosus (rash and congenital heart block).

Pharmacotherapy is often warranted, although nonpharmacologic measures remain a cornerstone of treatment. Pregabalin, an antiepileptic drug, improves quality of life and decreases pain. It is one of only a few medications that are FDA approved for treating fibromyalgia. The medication should be initiated at low doses at night (i.e., 50 or 75 mg at bedtime) and slowly titrated as tolerated up to a maximum dosage of 225 mg twice daily. Common adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and peripheral edema. Weight gain of 7% or more is seen in nearly 10% of patients. Off-label use of gabapentin, another antiepileptic drug, has demonstrated effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial and is frequently used for this disorder in dosages up to 600 mg twice daily."

"). One of the most provocative environmental factors for the development of rheumatoid arthritis is smoking. A dose-dependent relationship exists between smoking and the development of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Smoking can lead to lung inflammation, which activates such enzymes as peptidylarginine deiminase, which deaminates arginine to form citrullinated peptides. HLA-D alleles code for the shared epitope. The shared epitope, a five–amino acid sequence, preferentially binds and presents citrullinated peptide antigens. This leads to the production of anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies that could initiate inflammation by fixing complement in the tissues. Patients who smoke are at increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those with a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, and should be counseled about smoking cessation. The risk for RA increases with an increasing number of smoking pack-years, and the risk decreases as the interval of smoking cessation increases. Combining behavioral counseling with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either modality alone in achieving long-term smoking abstinence."

The presentation is usually inflammatory, with pain, swelling, and warmth of the involved joint. Systemic markers of inflammation may be elevated, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in this patient. Plain radiographs, like the one shown for this patient, may demonstrate chondrocalcinosis. Chondrocalcinosis is seen as a thin white line that tracks below the surface layer of the cartilage because it represents CPP deposition within the cartilage.

TNF inhibitors, such as etanercept (a fusion protein), adalimumab, or infliximab (monoclonal antibodies), can be used. The selection may depend on the presence of comorbid disease, such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease, where the monoclonal antibodies would be more appropriate. TNF inhibitors have been shown to be disease modifying in AS. Interleukin-17 inhibitors, such as secukinumab, could be used in patients in whom a TNF inhibitor fails or in whom a TNF inhibitor may be contraindicated. The ACR conditionally recommends TNF inhibitors over interleukin-17 inhibitors in patients in whom NSAIDs fail or who cannot tolerate NSAIDs."

"). This patient has hypertensive crisis due to underlying systemic sclerosis, which is best treated with an ACE inhibitor. Captopril in particular is useful in this situation because it has a relatively short half-life and can be titrated rapidly to control blood pressure. Scleroderma renal crisis can occur in limited or diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis but is more common in diffuse disease. Risk factors include recent onset of systemic sclerosis (≤4 years), diffuse skin disease, presence of anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies, and recent use of glucocorticoids. The pathophysiology is thought to be related to endothelial injury leading to vascular constriction, intimal thickening, and fibrin deposition, with endothelin 1 playing an important role in this process. Also important in the pathophysiology is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; interrupting this pathway has been a key to therapy. Manifestations of scleroderma renal crisis are those seen in patients with hypertensive emergency, such as headache, encephalopathy, retinopathy, acute kidney injury, and heart failure. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria are common laboratory features. Evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear is a clue to the diagnosis. ACE inhibitors are disease-modifying agents for this potentially fatal complication, regardless of the serum creatinine level. Patients may need temporary dialysis, and kidney function may improve during therapy for up to 24 months after presentation. Prophylactic use of ACE inhibitors does not prevent scleroderma renal crisis and may lead to poorer renal outcomes."

Symptoms and inflammatory markers usually respond rapidly to glucocorticoids. However, glucocorticoids have many adverse effects, and this patient will benefit from the addition of a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Generally accepted indications for a glucocorticoid-sparing agent include the presence of comorbid diseases that are negatively affected by glucocorticoids, development of glucocorticoid-related adverse effects, and prolonged need for treatment. This patient meets all indications for a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 blocker, is highly effective for the treatment of GCA when administered during glucocorticoid tapering or as monotherapy following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. The 2021 American College of Rheumatology guidelines make a conditional recommendation for glucocorticoids with tocilizumab over oral glucocorticoids alone in patients with newly diagnosed GCA."

"). Osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis is based on history and physical examination; radiography is confirmatory but may not be necessary. In early OA, clinical findings may not be accompanied by radiographic changes; conversely, some patients with prominent radiographic changes may have minimal or no symptoms. Patients with OA are typically older than 50 years of age; diagnosis at an earlier age should prompt inquiry into a history of previous joint damage, endocrine or metabolic disorders, or a genetic proclivity for early disease. Joints most commonly affected are the hands (first carpometacarpal joints, distal and proximal interphalangeal joints), feet (first metatarsophalangeal joint and mid foot), knees, hips, and spine, but the distribution varies. Localized OA, in which a single joint is affected, is more often a consequence of injury or joint asymmetry and often occurs in weight-bearing joints (hip or knee). Furthermore, this patient has noninflammatory arthritis, as evidenced by minimal morning stiffness and no evidence of warmth, soft-tissue swelling, or effusion; these findings further support the diagnosis of OA. Additional tests would be helpful if other causes of arthritis were being considered or would aid in decisions about therapeutic options. No additional tests are needed in this patient."

The disease causes inflammation and subsequent stenoses in the large arteries, including the aorta and its branches. Manifestations can include limb ischemia and associated diminished (or absent) pulses, mesenteric ischemia, and hypertension due to renal artery stenosis. Clues on examination include bruits over large vessels, absent pulses, discrepancy in blood pressure between limbs, and hypertension. Laboratory findings indicate active systemic inflammation but are not diagnostic. Imaging of the aorta and its branches is diagnostic; biopsy of an involved vessel is not feasible.

A serious complication of SLE is osteonecrosis, which most commonly affects the hips but can also involve other large joints, and should be suspected when there is otherwise unexplained pain and/or reduced range of motion in a single joint. Long-term and high prednisone dosages (>20 mg/d), severe/active SLE, and vasculitis are all associated with increased risk. In patients with osteonecrosis, the plain radiograph can remain normal for months after symptoms begin. MRI is the modality of choice for sensitive evaluation of early disease, with plain radiography useful to diagnose and monitor later stages. Small lesions can improve and resolve spontaneously, but larger lesions usually lead to bony collapse and structural sequelae. New hip pain in patients with a history of SLE should prompt evaluation for osteonecrosis with MRI."

There is no disease-modifying treatment to globally address manifestations of Sjögren syndrome, and no medication alters the natural history of chronic oral and ocular dryness. However, treatments can alleviate xerostomia and xerophthalmia. For oral dryness, behavioral management may be enough to allay symptoms. This can include chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugar-free sour candies or lozenges to stimulate saliva, taking frequent small sips of water, or using a spray bottle to moisten mucosal surfaces (to limit oral intake). Saliva substitutes are available commercially in the form of oral sprays, gels, and rinses for more severe symptoms but are often not effective. Cevimeline, a cholinergic muscarinic agonist, stimulates salivation and is appropriate for moderate oral dryness that does not improve with the aforementioned interventions. Pilocarpine, another muscarinic agonist, is an equally efficacious alternative to cevimeline. Cholinergic adverse effects of cevimeline and pilocarpine can include sweating, abdominal pain, nausea, flushing, and increased urination. Ocular dryness can be treated with over-the-counter remedies, such as artificial tears (used during the day) and eye lubricants (usually used before bedtime). Refractory or severe ocular dryness may be managed by using topical immunosuppressive-containing drops, such as cyclosporine (a calcineurin inhibitor) or lifitegrast (an integrin inhibitor)."

Her normal comprehensive metabolic panel, serum magnesium level, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level exclude all secondary causes other than hemochromatosis. Measurements of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are appropriate screening tests for hemochromatosis.

In particular, the presence of anti–Mi-2 antibodies predicts a good prognosis with a low risk for interstitial lung disease and cancer. Her symptoms have completely resolved with an initial course of oral prednisone, typically initiated at 1 mg/kg/d. Combination therapy with glucocorticoid-sparing agents is important for maintaining a clinical response and for minimizing glucocorticoid adverse effects in patients with dermatomyositis. Initiation of methotrexate or azathioprine at diagnosis or after an early initial response to glucocorticoids is the most appropriate next step to achieve long-term disease control and to allow effective tapering of the prednisone dose. Intravenous immune globulin can be added as first- or second-line treatment for patients with an inadequate response to initial combination therapy or with more severe disease. There is no guidance for optimal duration of therapy, but in the absence of flares, most patients can discontinue treatment in 9 to 12 months. Physical therapy may help maintain muscle function and should be used in all patients."

Patients with Felty syndrome are at risk for serious bacterial infections, lower extremity ulceration, lymphoma, and vasculitis. Patients may present with an asymptomatic decline in the neutrophil count that is detected on routine laboratory testing for medication toxicity. Because a decline in leukocyte count can also be an adverse effect of numerous medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, it is important to evaluate this possibility. However, medications are far less likely to specifically reduce only the neutrophil count and are not likely to be associated with splenomegaly. Some patients present with an infection related to neutropenia. In this instance, the total leukocyte count may be normal at the time of presentation but fall with treatment of the infection. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis can also have large granular lymphocyte syndrome, which can progress to large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Findings overlap with Felty syndrome and include neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and recurrent infections."

There are three primary patterns of lupus-specific skin rashes: ACLE, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The lupus-specific skin diseases are not found in other conditions and have varying associations with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Identifying the pattern of the skin disease can be important for guiding additional evaluation and treatment. ACLE often presents with a photosensitive malar or butterfly rash, with patchy, edematous, erythematous areas on the cheeks and over the nose, sparing the nasolabial folds. Similar rashes can occur on other sun-exposed skin, including the neck, upper chest, and arms. Nearly all patients with ACLE have SLE, and as such tend to have systemic symptoms and positive serologic results (typically antinuclear, anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB antibodies)."

Clues that this is GPA specifically include sinus, kidney, and lung involvement; the skin findings (palpable purpura is not specific for GPA but strongly suggests a small-vessel vasculitis); peripheral nervous system involvement (left foot sensory loss); and the presence of antiproteinase-3 antibodies. To confirm the diagnosis and guide management, tissue biopsy (in this case, kidney) may be done if possible. High-dose glucocorticoids plus either rituximab (preferred) or cyclophosphamide is the appropriate treatment for induction of remission in severe organ-threatening or life-threatening GPA. Selected patients may benefit from plasma exchange. Once remission is achieved, patients should receive maintenance therapy consisting of rituximab, methotrexate, or azathioprine; rituximab appears to be most effective for preventing relapse and is guideline preferred. On their own, high-dose glucocorticoids are not sufficient for induction and maintenance treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Mortality rates in patients receiving only glucocorticoids are high. Observational studies from the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated that glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide was associated with a significant improvement in survival, five times that of historical controls, and a lower frequency of relapse."

Patients whose condition is unresponsive to initial treatment with methotrexate, with or without another nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, could receive triple therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) or a biologic agent. The choice of a drug regimen in such patients depends on many factors, including disease activity, comorbid conditions, patient preferences for route of administration and frequency of dosing, adverse prognostic features, and regulatory and cost barriers to drug access. This patient has active clinical disease and radiographic evidence of worsening joint damage despite combination treatment with sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Escalation to additional therapy with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, such as adalimumab, is an appropriate choice. Despite multiple comorbidities, this patient has no contraindications to treatment with a biologic (such as active infection or heart failure). All TNF inhibitors provide similar benefit and may be used in this patient based on the factors outlined above. These regimens may have a faster onset of action than triple therapy with nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs."

Characteristic mucocutaneous findings of SLE accompany arthritis onset, including malar rash, discoid rash, and alopecia. Systemic involvement (e.g., leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nephritis) may also be present. Almost all patients with SLE will be positive for antinuclear antibodies. Because this patient lacks any additional features of SLE, and because positivity for anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies is not a feature of SLE arthritis, a diagnosis of SLE is unlikely."

"). This patient has dermatomyositis. A muscle biopsy is not necessary to diagnose dermatomyositis in patients with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings, including proximal muscle weakness, strikingly elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and skin manifestations that are unique to dermatomyositis. The most typical feature is the Gottron rash (Gottron papules and Gottron sign), which is characterized by erythematous to violaceous areas over the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. There is an association between risk for malignancy and dermatomyositis (3- to 12-fold higher in patients with new dermatomyositis than in age-matched populations) and, to a lesser extent, polymyositis. The risk for malignancy is greatest in the 3 years following the diagnosis of dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Common associated cancers are ovarian, lung, pancreas, stomach, and colon cancer and lymphoma. The most important initial step is symptom-directed testing and age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening because patients with active malignancy associated with dermatomyositis need prompt, appropriate treatment for both cancer and the autoimmune disease. If an initial directed cancer screen is normal, many experts will order CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Because this patient has unintentional weight loss and anemia, the first test should be a colonoscopy to assess for colorectal cancer."

This patient's symptoms (daily evening fevers accompanied by salmon-pink rash, inflammatory arthritis, sore throat, and serositis) and laboratory evidence of high inflammatory markers and leukocytosis are most consistent with AOSD, a condition of unknown cause. His high serum ferritin level, although not specific, is fairly characteristic of AOSD. Because no specific test exists for AOSD, it remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and other causes should be considered. Past treatment options for AOSD, including glucocorticoids and methotrexate, were frequently inadequate. The use of interleukin-β–directed biologic therapies, including anakinra and canakinumab, has been successful. Anti–interleukin-6 therapies have shown promise."

Choice of pharmacologic therapy is based on symptom profile, patient comorbidities, and medication adverse effects because few trials have directly compared the efficacy of medications. Of the available choices, duloxetine (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) is most appropriate for a patient with fibromyalgia and comorbid depression and anxiety because it is FDA approved for these indications as well. Duloxetine should be started at 30 mg/d and titrated to 60 mg/d after a week or so to mitigate nausea, a frequent early adverse effect that usually dissipates over time. If the drug is stopped, a slow taper should be used because withdrawal symptoms often occur with sudden discontinuation. Patients should be made aware that benefits of the medication will not be seen for several weeks. To measure interval improvement, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (a validated clinical tool) or other validated clinical tool should be completed before and an appropriate time after an intervention to assess change in clinical status."

"). Glucocorticoid therapy is a major risk factor for bone loss and increased fracture risk. In addition, fractures occur at higher bone mineral density values than in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The risk increases with dosage and duration, but even low dosages of 5 to 7.5 mg/d are associated with increased risk for fracture. Thus, patients receiving long-term glucocorticoids should be assessed for bone loss and fracture risk and treated on the basis of the assessment. Both bone density measurement and glucocorticoid-corrected (addition of 15% to the risk), Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX)–calculated, 10-year probability can be helpful in this assessment. This patient has a corrected FRAX score for the hip of 3.5%, placing her at a high risk for fracture and above the treatment threshold to prevent hip fracture (≥3% at the hip or ≥20% for major osteoporosis-related fracture). Thus, treatment for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is appropriate. This approach also applies to patients at moderate or intermediate risk for fracture (FRAX risk score for the hip of 1% to 3%); those with a score of 10% to 19% overall would also be a candidate for preventive treatment. Oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, are first-line therapy because of their efficacy, cost, availability, and ease of administration. They are preferred in guidelines not only because of cost, safety, and efficacy but also because of a lack of superiority of other osteoporosis medications. Clinical trial data show that both alendronate and risedronate have efficacy in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. For patients who cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates or have other circumstances precluding their use, intravenous zoledronic acid may be used."

Patients with autoimmune rheumatologic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are at increased risk for infections because of multiple factors, and infection prevention and vaccination are crucial. Ideally, patients with autoimmune diseases should be updated with vaccinations 2 to 4 weeks before initiating immunomodulatory agents, but this is not easy to accomplish. Evidence suggests attenuation of response to vaccines in patients receiving biologic agents. Patients receiving traditional immunomodulatory agents (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) in doses that cause only low-grade immunosuppression can receive any immunizations, killed or live, without any problems. Low-grade immunosuppression is defined as short-term prednisone use of less than 20 mg/d, methotrexate dosage of less than 0.4 mg/kg/wk, and azathioprine dosage of less than 3.0 mg/kg/d. Patients who are receiving these immunosuppressive agents at higher dosages should not receive live vaccines. Similarly, patients receiving biologic or small-molecule therapies should not receive live vaccines, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, or live attenuated vaccines, such as influenza and herpes zoster, because of risk for infection by the vaccine agent. In this patient, methotrexate at a low dosage (0.2 mg/kg/wk) would not constitute a contraindication to administration of any vaccination. However, she is also is being treated with tofacitinib, and vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella is therefore contraindicated."

") will be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Among some 100 genetic loci currently recognized as associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk, the most important is the class II HLA group, especially HLA-D alleles. These alleles code for the shared epitope, a five–amino acid sequence that binds and presents citrullinated peptide antigens important in the pathophysiology of RA. Because citrulline is an amino acid that does not normally occur in humans, citrullinated proteins are immunogenic, especially in people who also have the shared epitope. Citrulline is formed by the action of the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase, which is found at sites of inflammation and deiminates arginine to form citrullinated peptides. Anti-CCP antibodies are closely associated with the pathogenesis of RA and are highly specific (95%). In addition, anti-CCP antibodies may be positive in patients with RA who are negative for rheumatoid factor. Rheumatoid factor is less specific for RA, is present in only about 70% of patients with RA, and may be seen in other diseases (such as hepatitis C virus infection, endocarditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus). However, a few patients, particularly early in the course of the disease, may be negative for anti-CCP antibodies but positive for rheumatoid factor; thus, both anti-CCP antibodies and rheumatoid factor, rather than either alone (",
{

It can be distinguished clinically from polymyositis by the involvement of distal muscle groups in addition to proximal muscle groups. Weakness in finger flexors and atrophy of forearm muscles are characteristic features. Muscle distribution is usually but not always symmetric. Up to half of patients with inclusion body myositis have cricopharyngeal muscle involvement, leading to dysphagia and increased risk for aspiration. Patients with inclusion body myositis can have elevated serum creatine kinase levels, but elevations are usually more modest, less than 10 times the upper limit of normal, as compared with other forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in which serum creatine kinase levels are generally higher.

"). This patient has new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with nephritis. Lupus nephritis can present with minimal laboratory abnormalities (non-nephrotic proteinuria, hematuria), frank nephritis (hypertension, lower extremity edema, active urine sediment, and elevated serum creatinine level), and/or nephrosis (nephrotic-range proteinuria, dependent edema, and thrombosis). Anti–double-stranded DNA antibody titers are a marker for risk, and complement consumption is a common phenomenon during active kidney disease. Untreated active disease may progress to kidney failure. He has few other symptoms of SLE, but laboratory findings and clinical presentation strongly suggest this diagnosis. Although kidney biopsy is indicated to determine histologic subtype and chronicity, treatment should not be delayed. High-dose or “pulse” glucocorticoids are indicated for new or recurrent active nephritis and should be followed by a glucocorticoid taper. Hydroxychloroquine is indicated in almost all patients with newly diagnosed SLE. In addition, for moderate or severe disease that is organ-threatening, additional immunosuppressive therapy is indicated to control disease and to allow for tapering of glucocorticoid therapy. For most patients with new nephritis, induction with mycophenolate mofetil is the preferred agent. Intravenous cyclophosphamide can also be used if patients have severe disease or are intolerant to mycophenolate."

She has no ocular dryness; has a serologic profile that does not comport with a diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome (absence of high titers of antinuclear antibodies and/or rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies); and has no other symptoms, physical examination findings, or laboratory results to suggest the disease. Although it is not impossible that she has Sjögren syndrome, the oral dryness is more likely the result of another cause. Several medications (such as antidepressants and antihistamines) frequently cause oral dryness. The patient takes three such medications (amitriptyline, cetirizine, and citalopram). It is important that patients like this are not misdiagnosed with rheumatologic disease and treated inappropriately with immunosuppressive agents."

"). Prominently absent from this patient's history are indications of skin disease, serositis, and kidney disease; other than dry mouth, the physical examination is normal. The normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate argues against a system inflammatory or autoimmune condition. An antinuclear antibody titer of 1:80 is nonspecific and unremarkable and may be seen in up to 50% of persons tested. Even at much higher titers, a positive antinuclear antibody result alone does not imply the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus."

The appearance of the rash suggests small-vessel rather than medium-vessel involvement (for example, there are no subcutaneous nodules or necrosis). Several types of small-vessel vasculitis can affect the skin. The first step in the evaluation of a cutaneous vasculitis is to determine whether systemic symptoms or findings are present. In this case, no findings suggest a systemic illness. The physical examination is unremarkable aside from the rash, and results of laboratory testing are similarly unrevealing. This strongly suggests that the diagnosis is hypersensitivity vasculitis. This condition is often triggered by medications (thiazide diuretics are among the most frequent culprits) or infections, although about 50% of patients have no known precipitant. Drug-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis most often occurs 7 to 10 days after the introduction of a new medication, and recovery is likely with discontinuation of the drug. If symptoms persist or recur, anti-inflammatory agents, topical or low-dose systemic glucocorticoids, colchicine, or dapsone may be helpful."

This reaction is heralded by a rash that may progress to DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome (DRESS is also increasingly being referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [DIHS] and drug hypersensitivity syndrome [DHS]). Hypersensitivity to allopurinol may also include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. This patient has risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity, including Han Chinese descent, and should undergo HLA-B*58:01 allele testing. Additional risk factors for severe cutaneous reactions include female sex, history of rash with allopurinol, and concurrent use of thiazide or loop diuretics. Drug hypersensitivity can still occur in patients negative for the HLA-B*58:01 allele, and patients must be counseled to stop the drug immediately if a rash occurs."

The patient has an inflammatory disease with new-onset kidney disease but without evidence of glomerular involvement. Unlike small-vessel vasculitis, which causes glomerulonephritis, PAN affects the renal vasculature; therefore, it does not generally cause an active urinary sediment but can cause renal insufficiency and hypertension. The nodular skin lesions suggest medium-vessel vasculitis. The postprandial abdominal pain points to mesenteric ischemia. The patient has a left foot drop, suggesting peripheral neuropathy. Mononeuritis multiplex, which can be seen in small- or medium-vessel disease, is common in PAN. When a patient suspected of having PAN has abdominal symptoms, imaging of the mesenteric vasculature can be diagnostic. In this case, magnetic resonance angiography would demonstrate characteristic findings of PAN affecting the gut: multiple aneurysms and luminal irregularities (stenosis) in bigger arteries, with occlusive lesions in smaller ones."

Testing for the HLA-B*58:01 allele before starting allopurinol is conditionally recommended by the ACR in high-risk populations (including persons of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, and African descent).

Symptoms are most pronounced in the morning and improve after several hours. Although some patients also have peripheral arthritis (usually of the knees and wrists), most do not. Physical findings are usually limited to difficulty moving the affected areas (shoulders and hips). There is no diagnostic test specific for PMR. With a reasonable degree of suspicion for PMR, an empiric glucocorticoid trial is appropriate. Initiating prednisone at 12.5 to 20 mg/d is appropriate for this generally self-limited illness.

"). Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis results from cryoglobulin-containing immune complexes depositing in small- and medium-sized arteries, leading to an inflammatory response. Of the three types of cryoglobulinemia, only types II and III (mixed cryoglobulinemia) cause vasculitis. Type II, which usually results from certain viral infections and autoimmune disease, is typified by a monoclonal IgM with activity against IgG (i.e., a rheumatoid factor) as well as polyclonal IgG. Type III is usually associated with autoimmune disease and is characterized by polyclonal IgG and polyclonal IgM. This patient has severe cryoglobulinemia, with new-onset kidney failure, palpable purpura, and peripheral neuropathy affecting the left radial nerve. Cutaneous involvement (palpable purpura, digital ischemia, ulcers, necrosis, and livedo reticularis) occurs in about 90% of patients. Other common manifestations include glomerulonephritis (usually membranoproliferative) and arthralgia without arthritis. Pulmonary and/or gastrointestinal involvement is rare. In addition to detection of cryoglobulins, laboratory abnormalities frequently include depressed C4 complement and low CH50, as well as a positive rheumatoid factor result; this patient's undetectable C4 level in conjunction with a high rheumatoid factor level therefore strongly support a cryoglobulinemia diagnosis. Most cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia result from another underlying condition, the most common of which is hepatitis C virus infection (suggested by elevated aminotransferase levels). Patients with cryoglobulinemia should undergo hepatitis C virus testing and be treated if the result is positive. Severe cryoglobulinemia requires urgent treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids plus rituximab."

The active metabolite of leflunomide (teriflunomide) undergoes enterohepatic circulation and has a half-life of nearly 3 weeks. Because 5 half-lives are required for a metabolite to be significantly cleared, leflunomide levels have been detected in the serum months following discontinuation of the drug. Demonstration of undetectable blood levels is needed before conception. An 11-day cholestyramine washout must be used to remove teriflunomide and should be followed up with measurement of leflunomide and its metabolite levels to ensure removal of drug. Management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during pregnancy is complicated."

Because this patient is allergic to allopurinol and febuxostat has failed, pegloticase is indicated. Pegloticase is recombinant pegylated uricase administered intravenously every 2 weeks. All patients should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity before administration of pegloticase; low activity of G6PD poses a risk for hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia, and pegloticase is contraindicated in that setting. Pegloticase rapidly lowers the serum urate level, and prophylactic therapy (colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids) must be administered concurrently with treatment. Formation of antibody to pegloticase may occur (30%-50% of patients) and cause severe infusion reactions. Serum urate level must be checked before each infusion. After the initial dose, a serum urate level greater than 6.0 mg/dL (0.35 mmol/L) on two consecutive assessments indicates loss of efficacy due to antibody formation, necessitating discontinuation of pegloticase. Pegloticase should not be given with any other urate-lowering therapy so that interpretation of the serum urate level before each infusion is clear. Therefore, this patient should discontinue febuxostat."

", and a high-resolution CT scan that is typical for nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. Patients may also have usual interstitial pneumonitis. A usual interstitial pneumonitis pattern demonstrates honeycombing on high-resolution CT and is less responsive to therapy than nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. The 6-minute walk test provides a functional assessment; if oxygen desaturation of 88% or below occurs while the patient is walking, the patient is a candidate for home oxygen therapy. Some studies suggest that aggressive treatment of gastrointestinal reflux disease may have a positive effect on ILD progression. Mycophenolate mofetil is a mainstay of therapy for ILD in systemic sclerosis. Data from open-label trials suggest that mycophenolate mofetil can stabilize and, in some cases, improve lung function. The Scleroderma Lung Study II compared oral cyclophosphamide for 1 year to mycophenolate mofetil for 2 years. Both agents were equally efficacious in improving and stabilizing FVC; however, mycophenolate mofetil was better tolerated and can be used for many years, whereas cyclophosphamide has a time-limited utility due to toxicity. Expert opinion places mycophenolate mofetil first for both induction and maintenance therapy in patients with systemic sclerosis and ILD."

Both proximal and distal muscle involvement occur; finger and forearm flexor involvement is nearly pathognomonic. Up to half of patients with inclusion body myositis have cricopharyngeal muscle involvement, leading to dysphagia and increased risk for aspiration. Serum creatine kinase levels are elevated to a lesser extent than seen in other forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Autoantibodies are less often present, but anti-NT5c1A autoantibodies are found in up to half of patients and rarely in healthy persons.

The patient has post–enteric infection reactive arthritis, with asymmetric pauci-arthritis involving the lower extremities, enthesitis involving the Achilles tendon, and dactylitis of the right fourth toe and left third and fourth toes. Reactive arthritis is the least common form of spondyloarthritis (2% of cases). Reactive arthritis typically entails arthritis/enthesitis in the lower extremities 2 to 3 weeks after an enteric infection or a bout of nongonococcal urethritis or cervicitis. Joint inflammation can be intense, with high leukocyte counts in the synovial fluid. The sacroiliac joints and spine may be involved. Enthesitis usually affects the heel (plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendinitis) or may present as dactylitis of the fingers or toes. Extra-articular features can include nonpainful oral ulcers; ocular inflammation (conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, or anterior uveitis); and a psoriasiform rash (keratoderma blennorrhagicum), typically on the hands and feet. Some patients also develop circinate balanitis on the glans penis or erythema nodosum on the lower extremities. Reactive arthritis is treated with NSAIDs at anti-inflammatory doses for at least 2 weeks. If relief is incomplete, intra-articular glucocorticoid injections and oral glucocorticoids can be used. If symptoms persist beyond 3 to 6 months, the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, may be necessary for symptom control and to prevent joint erosion. Therapy is discontinued 3 to 6 months following disease remission. Most cases of reactive arthritis last 6 weeks to 6 months; only 25% of patients have persistent disease. Long-term complications can include erosive arthritis, usually of the metatarsophalangeal joints; aortitis with aortic valve insufficiency; atrioventricular heart block; and uveitis."

IgG4-positive plasmablasts on biopsy confirm the diagnosis. The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase level suggests associated biliary involvement. The absence of elevated serum IgG4 antibodies is not exclusionary because serum antibodies are often not present. Treatment of IgG4-related disease most often consists of initial high-dose glucocorticoids followed by a slow taper. Because the disease often recurs during taper, and because glucocorticoids bear significant toxicity, coadministration of rituximab (an anti-CD20 antibody that indirectly depletes plasmablasts) is often initiated to permit accelerated glucocorticoid taper. However, rituximab monotherapy is also effective and can be used alone in patients with absolute or relative contraindications to glucocorticoid therapy."

The prevalence of kidney disease in AS is 2% to 13%; in the past, AA amyloidosis was the leading cause of kidney disease (and remains a major cause) in patients with uncontrolled AS. With the advent of biologic therapy and subsequent control of inflammation in AS, the prevalence of AA amyloidosis has declined. AA amyloidosis most commonly affects the kidneys, manifesting as proteinuria and eventually end-stage kidney disease. It less commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract, heart, and peripheral nerves. In AS, AA amyloidosis is most often seen in men, patients with peripheral joint disease, and patients with a history of uveitis. Affected patients will usually manifest high levels of inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, indicating insufficient control of disease-related inflammation. Treatment with effective medications, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, may stabilize or improve the kidney manifestations of AA amyloidosis in patients with AS. When AA amyloidosis is suspected, Congo red staining of biopsy specimens from the kidney, rectum, or abdominal subcutaneous fat will reveal amyloid deposition."

The organism most commonly implicated in prosthetic joint infection in this setting with subacute onset, subtle findings 3 to 12 months after surgery is coagulase-negative staphylococcus.

First-line therapy for mild SLE includes hydroxychloroquine, often with glucocorticoids if a more rapid response is needed. Many patients will need additional immunomodulatory therapy at some point in their disease. Hydroxychloroquine is a mainstay of treatment in SLE because it reduces disease-associated damage, prevents disease flares, and improves kidney and overall survival. In addition, hydroxychloroquine may reduce the risk for thrombosis, liver disease, and myocardial infarction and improve lipid profiles. Glucocorticoids are also used in most patients with SLE, particularly in acute disease. After disease stabilizes, glucocorticoids are tapered to the lowest effective dosage, preferably to no more than 7.5 mg/d within 4 to 6 months, and should be discontinued entirely if possible. Glucocorticoid exposure, especially at high doses, should be limited because of associated risk for organ damage, infection, and premature mortality. Azathioprine or methotrexate is recommended if patients with mild disease have refractory symptoms. All patients with SLE should be counseled on sun protection, vaccinations, and lifestyle modifications to optimize cardiovascular health."

This patient has classic ankylosing spondylitis (AS), as suggested by inflammatory low back pain with signs of sacroiliac joint irritation, limitation of lumbar spine motion, and changes of sacroiliitis on radiograph. NSAIDs are recommended first-line therapy for AS. In general, an NSAID must be dosed toward the higher end of the dosing range to modify new bone formation and have a significant impact on inflammation. If an NSAID is started early in the course of AS (<3 years), 35% of patients will enter remission compared with only 12% to 15% of those starting it later. Unlike with other rheumatologic diseases, evidence suggests that NSAID use in AS has a disease-modifying effect. Patients should be aware of and monitored for NSAID toxicity, such as hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and kidney disease. Physical therapy is the most important nonpharmacologic intervention in AS. The goals of therapy include improving pain and stiffness, maintaining range of motion, and reducing disability; transition to an ongoing daily exercise program is optimal."

Patients may have skin and joint symptoms but are at a much lower risk for organ damage. Patients with drug-induced lupus erythematosus often have transiently positive antinuclear antibodies but may lack typical autoantibodies specific to SLE. Classically, patients with drug-induced lupus erythematosus may have antihistone antibodies, although these antibodies are not always present and are not specific. Other antibodies, including ANCA (especially p-ANCA) and F-actin, can be seen with minocycline use. Most patients with drug-induced lupus symptoms will improve with discontinuation of the medication causing the symptoms, but some may need symptomatic treatment."

Diagnosis is suggested by history and can be confirmed with validated criteria (e.g., the 2016 revisions to the American College of Rheumatology Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria). This illness is not autoimmune or inflammatory, and extensive laboratory testing is not advised unless another comorbid disease is suggested. Although some patients may have tender points, assessment of tender points on examination is unreliable (particularly in men) and no longer among the clinical criteria for diagnosis. Fibromyalgia tends to be associated with other medically unexplained syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, and is especially common in patients with migraine headaches."

The most robust evidence supports exercise in the treatment of knee and hip OA; less evidence is available for hand OA. Many helpful exercises are available for knee and hip OA, and the evidence indicates that no one exercise program is superior. However, the best program is likely the one to which the patient will adhere. Walking is the most common form of aerobic exercise evaluated in studies, either on a treadmill or as part of a supervised community program. Strengthening exercises with the use of isokinetic weight machines, resistance exercises, and isometric exercise also provide value. Aquatic exercise often encompasses aspects of aerobic fitness exercises and exercises for enhancing joint range of motion in a low-impact environment. The ACR/AF guideline notes a dose-response relationship of weight loss and resultant symptom and functional improvement in patients with OA who have overweight or obesity. Weight loss attempts coupled with an exercise program increase the benefit to the patient. Even small amounts of weight loss (5%) can have a positive effect on pain and function."

Headache is present in more than 60% of patients with GCA and may be frontal, occipital, unilateral, or generalized; it may be constant, intermittent, or waxing and waning. The important point is that the headache is new. A frequent nonheadache manifestation of GCA is jaw claudication, owing to decreased blood flow to the muscles of mastication. Jaw claudication is found in nearly 50% of patients with GCA, and this symptom should always be explored on review of systems in a patient with polymyalgia rheumatica. Other key questions to ask such patients include whether they have recent changes in vision (e.g., short-lived episodes of amaurosis fugax, diplopia, or blurriness) and scalp tenderness (e.g., with hair brushing). A blood C-reactive protein level of 12.8 mg/dL (128 mg/L) would be unusual for polymyalgia rheumatica alone; this degree of systemic inflammation is more in keeping with a vasculitis, such as GCA."

"). This patient has had a first episode of podagra (gout of the great toe) treated effectively with colchicine. He has a minimally elevated serum urate level. Hydrochlorothiazide and other loop diuretics cause hyperuricemia and may have contributed to this gout episode. Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker that may have some uricosuric effect in addition to lowering blood pressure. For patients with gout, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conditionally recommends switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternate antihypertensive when feasible. The ACR also conditionally recommends switching to losartan preferentially as an antihypertensive agent when feasible. Although this patient has had only a single flare, modifying his iatrogenic risk factors for gout is reasonable at this time."

Because relapsing polychondritis is a clinical diagnosis for which no specific tests exist (although certain autoantibodies, including those to type 2 collagen, may be supportive), other causes should be considered and ruled out as appropriate. Management depends on severity: NSAIDs and dapsone for mild symptoms and high-dose glucocorticoids for initial management of acute and/or severe involvement.

Because 90% of patients with GPA are positive for antiproteinase-3 antibodies, testing can be considered."

"). This patient is experiencing the manifestations of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which affects 39% of patients with systemic sclerosis. SIBO occurs in both the limited and diffuse cutaneous forms of systemic sclerosis. The most frequent symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea. The diarrhea is often explosive and typically follows a meal. Over time, SIBO can lead to malabsorption, malnutrition, and weight loss. Jejunal aspirate is considered the gold standard but is often not used in clinical practice because of the requirement for endoscopy to obtain cultures and the patchy nature of small intestinal overgrowth. Glucose and lactulose breath tests have acceptable specificity (around 80%) but poor sensitivity (30%-40%) for diagnosing SIBO. Diagnosis requires typical symptoms and a confirmatory test, although empiric antibiotic therapy with monitoring for improvement in symptoms may be reasonable in patients with a high probability of SIBO, such as this patient. The protocol is to a take a different antibiotic with activity against bowel flora (e.g., ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and rifaximin) for the first 10 days of the month for 4 months. Systemic sclerosis affects both smooth muscle and autonomic nerves and leads to small intestine hypomotility. Hypomotility results in food and liquid stasis, which then fosters bacterial overgrowth. SIBO also causes bile acid deconjugation, leading to dietary malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. A low-fat diet may help reduce the intensity of the diarrhea."

The extent of involvement and presence of erosions on MRI increase the specificity of the result. However, plain radiography remains the cornerstone of radiographic diagnosis in spondyloarthritis and has sufficient specificity to confirm a diagnosis. Sacroiliitis shown by MRI is included in the ASAS classification criteria and would be useful if the plain radiograph was normal. In this case, checking HLA-B27 antigen would be more cost-effective for classification as an axial spondyloarthritis if the plain radiograph was normal. Plain radiography is the initial imaging choice in patients suspected of having AS because of its relatively low cost and safety."

"), 1 mg/kg/d, to treat a flare of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during pregnancy. An SLE flare during pregnancy can be difficult to distinguish from preeclampsia. Common features include proteinuria with hypertension and edema as well as headaches and other nonspecific symptoms. Thrombocytopenia is a relatively common feature of SLE but is also seen with preeclampsia, especially with progression to the HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets) syndrome. Clues to an SLE flare include markers of lupus activity, such as rising anti–double-stranded DNA antibody titers and falling serum complement levels. The serum urate level is often elevated in preeclampsia but not in SLE flares. This patient's clinical features suggest a flare of lupus nephritis. Treatment of SLE during pregnancy is difficult because many medications that could otherwise be used to treat a flare are contraindicated in pregnancy, including cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and belimumab. In this case, first-line treatment would include addition of high-dose or “pulse” glucocorticoid therapy. Concurrent treatment for preeclampsia may also be considered if diagnostic uncertainty remains. Blood pressure management with labetalol would be indicated for systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater."
