"). According to the pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm, this patient has a very low probability of having a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has an elevated D-dimer measurement, but D-dimer levels progressively increase during the course of pregnancy, making interpretation difficult. To assist in the diagnosis of PE in pregnant women, diagnostic algorithms have been developed. The YEARS criteria have been shown to reduce the risk of unnecessary CT angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having a PE. The YEARS algorithm assigns 1 point each for the presence of three cardinal criteria: clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis, hemoptysis, and PE as the most likely diagnosis (point range 0-3). The score is used in conjunction with four potential D-dimer results (<0.5 μg/mL [0.5 mg/L], ≥0.5 μg/mL [0.5 mg/L], <1 μg/mL [1 mg/L], and ≥1 μg/mL [1 mg/L]). This patient met no YEARS clinical criteria and had a D-dimer measurement less than 1 μg/mL (1 mg/L). This corresponds to very low risk for PE, so she should not undergo additional testing or anticoagulation."
