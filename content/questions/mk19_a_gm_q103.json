"A 46-year-old woman is evaluated for an 8-month history of chest pain. She describes constant pain in the chest that intermittently worsens both at rest and with exertion. She misses work once or twice per month because of the pain. Results of previous evaluations, including cardiac enzyme levels, ECG, chest radiography, echocardiography, exercise stress testing, and CT of the chest, have been normal. She is worried and frustrated that a diagnosis has not been established, and she spends several hours daily searching for answers on the internet. She has no other medical problems. She currently takes acetaminophen, but it does not relieve the pain."
