Risk factors for infection include exposure to antibiotic and chemotherapeutic agents, older age, presence of inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal surgery, and (possibly) gastric acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors. Antibiotic stewardship is paramount in reducing incidence of infection, and hand washing with soap and water is the gold standard for infection control; alcohol-based gels do not eliminate spores. Disease severity (nonsevere, severe, and fulminant) and initial or recurrent presentation guide treatment selection. Nonsevere CDI is defined by a leukocyte count of less than 15,000/µL (15 × 10",

The 2021 Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America clinical practice guideline for CDI suggests either oral fidaxomicin (preferred) or oral vancomycin (alternative) for treatment of an initial episode of nonsevere or severe disease.
