He reports no eye or skin symptoms or neurologic disease. He is taking a therapeutic dosage of colchicine to prevent disease flares but has had three episodes of painful oral ulcers in the last 6 months during this treatment. He has received tapering doses of prednisone to control the disease during these episodes."

"). Behçet syndrome is a systemic vasculitis characterized by recurrent oral aphthae. Other manifestations include genital aphthae, ocular disease, skin lesions, gastrointestinal involvement, neurologic disease, vascular disease, and arthritis. The treatment of oral and genital ulcers is guided by the severity of symptoms and the presence of other disease manifestations. This patient's disease does not seem to be responding adequately to colchicine, which is an appropriate first-line therapy for mucocutaneous ulcerations. Hence, an alternate or additional treatment should be tried. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved for treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and prevention of oral ulcers in Behçet syndrome. It is a reasonable alternative to colchicine as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent for patients with recurrent oral ulcers. Apremilast must be started at a low dose and uptitrated over a few days to achieve a maintenance dosage of 30 mg twice daily. Clinical trial data also suggest a positive impact on genital ulcers, with a trend toward improvement, but the studies were not powered to assess this outcome. Apremilast is usually well tolerated but is associated with adverse events, such as diarrhea, nausea, and headache. It should be used cautiously in patients with depression. Systemic glucocorticoids in tapering doses can be used in patients who are refractory to colchicine and apremilast. However, if the patient requires continued systemic glucocorticoid therapy, azathioprine, thalidomide, or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors are most appropriate."
