"The most likely diagnosis is primary varicella-zoster virus infection. The skin lesions of primary varicella-zoster infection (chickenpox) progress over hours from erythematous macules and papules to vesicles. Vesicles often develop a pustular component (as seen in this patient), which then form crusted papules. Vesicles at various stages of evolution are found on the skin. Typically, new batches of lesions appear every few days, originate on the face and trunk, and spread to the extremities, resulting in a \"centripetal\" pattern of spread. The rash is frequently accompanied by a low-grade fever and malaise."
