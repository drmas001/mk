"). The patient has sudden-onset disabling focal neurologic symptoms without evidence of hemorrhage on imaging, with the most likely diagnosis being ischemic stroke. For patients with mild but disabling stroke symptoms, intravenous alteplase is indicated within 3 hours from symptom onset and up to 4.5 hours in select patients who meet treatment criteria. Because her blood pressure is above the recommended target of less than 185/110 mm Hg, she is ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis. Intravenous medications such as labetalol or nicardipine are therefore indicated to achieve that blood pressure target. Once this target blood pressure is achieved, intravenous alteplase can be administered. Blood pressure should be maintained at less than 180/105 mm Hg following alteplase administration."

") is an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor that interferes with binding of fibrinogen on the platelet surface and subsequent platelet aggregation. A systematic review of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke found that these agents are associated with a significant risk for intracranial hemorrhage without a measurable improvement in death or disability. Most of the data were related to the use of abciximab. These agents are not recommended in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke."

") is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which occurs in up to 6% of treated patients, and mortality can be as high as 50% when present. Hypertension is a primary risk factor for hemorrhage, and therefore, blood pressure should be less than 185/110 mm Hg before treatment; this patient's blood pressure exceeds this goal. Treatment with alteplase without achieving the blood pressure target with pharmacologic intervention is associated with a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications."
