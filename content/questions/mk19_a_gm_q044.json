") is the most appropriate treatment. Alcohol withdrawal may cause minor symptoms, such as tremulousness, diaphoresis, and palpitations, within 6 hours and hallucinosis and withdrawal seizures within 12 to 48 hours of cessation of alcohol use; symptoms may progress to severe withdrawal (delirium tremens), usually 48 to 96 hours after the last drink. Predictors of severe alcohol withdrawal include a history of delirium tremens and baseline systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher. No single symptom or sign is associated with exclusion of severe alcohol withdrawal. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar), is a commonly used standardized instrument to measure severity of alcohol withdrawal. The CIWA-Ar includes 10 easily observable clinical findings that are summed to create a score. A score less than 8 indicates mild withdrawal, a score of 8 to 15 indicates moderate withdrawal, and a score greater than 15 indicates severe withdrawal. These scores can be used to guide changes in clinical status and medication management. Some patients can be managed safely in the outpatient setting with close follow-up, whereas patients at greater risk for severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms (e.g., history of delirium tremens or seizures, concomitant drug use, elderly persons) should be hospitalized."

"Benzodiazepine therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for alcohol withdrawal. After initial dosing to control acute symptoms, benzodiazepines should be administered using a symptom-triggered approach. Symptom-triggered management of alcohol withdrawal in hospitalized patients results in a shorter course of therapy and less benzodiazepine use. It is as efficacious as scheduled or scheduled plus symptom-triggered management in managing symptoms. Chlordiazepoxide has a very long half-life and is typically preferred in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal because it is associated with less frequent changes from agitated to sedated and a lower chance for recurrent withdrawal or seizures. However, chlordiazepoxide may accumulate in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis; benzodiazepines with a shorter half-life, such as lorazepam (",
