"The image demonstrates the characteristic folding and tearing of a retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is a separation of the neurosensory layer of the retina from the choroid beneath. Symptoms include diminished vision, photopsia (flashes of light), abrupt onset of multiple floaters in the vision, and metamorphopsia (wavy vision). These symptoms may be followed by a sudden peripheral visual field defect that resembles a black curtain and may progress across the entire visual field. A retinal tear and elevation of the surrounding retina may be visible on dilated funduscopy. Immediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist is indicated for surgical treatment."
