"). This patient has advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma from a cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Diagnostic efforts should focus on identifying whether a patient is among the approximately 20% of patients with CUP who have a more favorable prognosis and who can benefit from a specific treatment strategy. A biopsy obtained from the site that can be sampled in the safest, least invasive manner is performed, and specimens are evaluated by immunohistochemical stains consistent with the tumor's pattern of presentation to attempt to establish a diagnosis of a more treatable subtype of CUP (for example, germ cell tumor or lymphoma). The clinical evaluation should not involve an exhaustive search for a primary site because detection of an asymptomatic and occult primary tumor does not improve outcome. Physicians should discuss with patients and their families that focusing on identification of the primary tumor can distract from the more important issue of managing the metastatic cancer. Efforts to identify primary tumors should focus only on tumors that are suggested by the clinical presentation or could be managed with a specific, effective therapy. In this case, metastatic disease located below the diaphragm is best managed as gastrointestinal cancer without additional testing for a primary cancer."
