"). Patients with persistent fasting severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL) are at risk for acute pancreatitis. Those with a previous history of pancreatitis are at even higher risk. Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia should make dietary modifications, including initiating a very-low-fat diet, avoiding refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and consuming omega-3 fatty acids. Contributing comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypothyroidism, and nephrotic syndrome, should also be addressed. If patients have persistent triglycerides of 500 mg/dL or more despite these interventions, fibrate therapy should be considered, with the goal of reducing triglycerides to less than 500 mg/dL to reduce the risk for pancreatitis. Fibrates can reduce triglycerides by 30% to 50% and could help this patient achieve a goal triglyceride level of less than 500 mg/dL."
