"), which is causing a painless visual field defect. Her symptoms of visual loss, flashing lights, and floaters should raise suspicion for this diagnosis, which can be confirmed by an ophthalmologist using indirect ophthalmoscopy or wide-field retinal photography. Indirect ophthalmoscopy using a condensing lens provides the ophthalmologist a wide field of vision of the retina and three-dimensional views showing elevation and depth. Because retinal detachment typically occurs far into the periphery, office-based direct ophthalmoscopy will likely be normal or at least nondiagnostic. Floaters may be described by patients as a “cobweb” and represent accompanying posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). This patient likely developed a PVD in the days preceding her presentation, which led to a retinal tear. Flashing lights represent vitreoretinal attachments stimulating retinal depolarization as they pull away from the retina. Larger retinal detachments cause more severe visual disturbances. Risk factors for retinal detachment include increasing age, myopia, and recent cataract surgery. This patient requires immediate ophthalmology referral for diagnosis and treatment to prevent further vision loss."

CRAO is most commonly associated with ipsilateral carotid artery atherosclerotic disease."
