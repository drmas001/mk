"The most likely diagnosis is spider angioma. Spider angiomas are vascular lesions characterized by a prominent central papular punctum, which is the site of dilated capillaries radiating from a central arteriole. They are typically found on the chest, face, and upper limbs. Spider angiomas are often seen in patients with cirrhosis and during normal pregnancy. Cherry angioma are small, circular dome-shaped collections of capillaries that, unlike spider angioma, do not blanch with pressure. Bed bug bites are pruritic erythematous papules that often occur in groups of two to four, most commonly on the trunk."
