The pain was located across the front of the chest, did not radiate, and was described as a dull ache. It was associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. Medical history is notable only for asthma treated with inhaled mometasone furoate."

"), by allowing visualization of coronary and other thoracic pathology, is the most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient with acute chest pain. Coronary CT angiography plays an important role in the evaluation of acute chest pain in the emergency department. This patient presents with signs and symptoms that could indicate an acute coronary syndrome, aortic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or other acute chest pain etiology. For patients with chest pain, coronary CT angiography also may be useful in patients with a possible diagnosis of non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who have equivocal initial troponin levels or a single troponin elevation without further symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, or in patients who have ischemic symptoms that resolved hours before undergoing testing."
