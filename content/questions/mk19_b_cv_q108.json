Endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for a specific group of patients before dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of the teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa. The highest risk for infective endocarditis (IE) is in patients with a prosthetic valve, previous IE, or congenital heart disease with residual flow disturbances. Current indications for endocarditis prophylaxis include (1) a history of IE; (2) cardiac transplantation with valve regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valve; (3) a prosthetic valve; (4) prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair, including annuloplasty rings and clips; (5) left ventricular assist device; (6) unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease; (7) repaired congenital cyanotic heart disease with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or device; (8) a defect that has been repaired (surgical or catheter based) with prosthetic material within the previous 6 months; and (9) surgical or transcatheter pulmonary artery valve or conduit placement, such as Melody valve and Contegra conduit. None of these indications is present in this patient, and antibiotic prophylaxis is unnecessary."
