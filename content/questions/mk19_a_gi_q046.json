"). Anal fissures are longitudinal mucosal tears in the anal canal characterized by anorectal pain worsened by bowel movements. Rectal bleeding with bowel movements or wiping is frequently reported. Anal fissures are idiopathic or result from trauma due to the passage of hard stool; receptive anal intercourse; or the insertion of a foreign body, such as an enema or endoscope. In this patient, the marked anorectal pain with attempted inspection of the perianal area in the context of painful defecatory bleeding is nearly diagnostic of anal fissure. A digital rectal examination is not needed in patients with severe anal pain, particularly when a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is excluded (as in this patient), because the likely diagnosis is an anal fissure. Acute anal fissures generally resolve within a few weeks with the use of sitz baths, psyllium, bulking agents, and topical vasodilators (nifedipine and nitroglycerin). Topical anesthetics and anti-inflammatory agents can be considered to address pain or bleeding, but their use is not required to promote fissure healing."

") are submucosal, arteriovenous sinusoids that are part of normal anorectal anatomy and are believed to play an important role in anal canal function. Age-related changes can cause the hemorrhoid beds to slide back and forth during defecation, resulting in mucoid anal discharge, as well as perianal wetness, soiling, irritation, and/or pruritus. Hemorrhoidal bleeding is most often associated with painless defecation. The presence of pain (as in this patient) should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis, such as anal fissure."
