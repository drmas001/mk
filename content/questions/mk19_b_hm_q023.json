"). This patient developed secondary or therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following breast cancer treatment. A primary AML diagnosis is often sufficient to recommend allogeneic HSCT, but therapy-related AML is even more likely to relapse and is an indication for HSCT. The patient's age, lack of comorbidities, and apparent remission after recent induction chemotherapy further support the indication for allogeneic HSCT. Patients undergo HLA typing, and siblings are considered for stem cell donation; HLA-matched unrelated donors may also be a reasonable option. Patients in first remission can have similar outcomes using alternative donors, represented by haploidentical transplantations (half-matched relatives, such as parent donating to child or vice versa or siblings who share a haplotype) or umbilical cord blood transplantations."
