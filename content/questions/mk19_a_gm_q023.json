"), weight, and blood glucose level should be monitored in this patient who has schizophrenia and takes olanzapine, a second-generation antipsychotic medication. Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, and undertreatment of medical disease is common in this population. Metabolic effects of antipsychotic therapy also can contribute to these conditions, which significantly increase mortality in patients with schizophrenia. The most common adverse effects of second-generation antipsychotic agents are weight gain (and sequelae of weight gain, such as hyperglycemia) and hyperlipidemia. The fasting blood glucose level should be measured upon initial medication initiation and at 3 months. Thereafter, the fasting glucose level should be checked at least annually. More frequent monitoring can be considered in patients with risk factors for diabetes. Lipid monitoring should be performed at baseline, at 3 months, and at least every 5 years thereafter."
