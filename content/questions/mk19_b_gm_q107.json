"). This patient's rash consists of red macules with pustules and telangiectasias within the rash, which after exposure to certain triggers becomes more prominent with stinging, burning, and itching. These findings are most consistent with rosacea. This condition is defined by chronic inflammation of the pilosebaceous units with increased vascular reactivity; it is most common among patients of Irish and English descent with light complexions, usually in the third to sixth decades of life. There are a variety of clinical presentations of rosacea, including erythrotelangiectatic (as ",

"The papulopustular variant of rosacea can be confused with acne, but rosacea does not present with comedonal lesions. Telangiectasias are seen in the erythrotelangiectatic subtype. Most patients also have frequent flushing in response to triggers, such as stress, alcohol consumption, heat, and excessive sunlight. The erythema of the cheeks can mimic the malar rash of systemic lupus erythematosus. Unlike lupus, however, the erythema of rosacea includes the nasolabial folds. Ocular rosacea may present in isolation or with associated skin findings. In ocular rosacea, the conjunctiva appears injected, and patients often describe a “gritty sensation.” In phymatous rosacea, severe sebaceous hyperplasia and chronic inflammation lead to fibrous overgrowth of the skin, creating a nodular, tumor-like deformation of the facial structures. Rhinophyma is the form most frequently encountered, and it is almost exclusively found in men. Treatment for rosacea is targeted toward the most prominent signs and symptoms in each patient. Topical metronidazole is a reasonable first-line option for patients with predominant papulopustular variant of rosacea as seen in this patient. Other effective topical agents include sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur, azelaic acid, topical calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and ivermectin. Oral antibiotics, such as low-dose doxycycline, have been shown to help control inflammation in ocular and papulopustular rosacea. Most patients will also benefit from avoidance of identified triggers, proper use of sun protection, and use of gentle skin cleansers."
