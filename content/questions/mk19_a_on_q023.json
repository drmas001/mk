") to establish baseline bone density and to assess for fracture risk. Patients diagnosed with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer are usually treated with a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiation therapy, which has been shown to improve survival. ADT results in many short- and long-term adverse effects. Short-term effects include loss of lean body mass, fatigue, gynecomastia, hair loss, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and vasomotor symptoms. Long-term risks include a possible increase in cardiovascular disease and cognitive dysfunction, increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and reduction in bone density. Patients with nonmetastatic cancer with one or more risk factors for osteoporotic fracture should be offered DEXA screening. ADT is a risk factor for osteoporosis. Patients who are prescribed a drug that causes bone loss or whose bone mineral density is near the threshold of treatment should be screened every 2 years. For patients with osteoporosis, bisphosphonates or denosumab may be offered to reduce the risk of fracture."
