"). Dysplastic nevi are melanocytic nevi that are often asymmetric, irregularly bordered, have more than one shade of brown, and may be quite large in diameter. Many have a “fried egg” appearance, with an eccentric dark brown papular center and surrounding light brown ring. Dysplastic nevi can display one or more of the identifying characteristics of melanoma (asymmetry, irregular border, multiple colors, diameter >6 mm, evolution over time), making an accurate clinical diagnosis impossible; excisional skin biopsy to remove the entire lesion should be performed for diagnosis. The lesion seen on this patient shows minimal color variability, so the most likely diagnosis is a dysplastic nevus. Although the potential for an individual dysplastic nevus to develop into melanoma is low, patients with dysplastic nevi are at increased risk for developing a melanoma. Patients with multiple dysplastic nevi are also at risk for developing melanoma and should be monitored closely. Some of these patients have dysplastic nevus syndrome. Criteria for this syndrome include a history of melanoma in one or more first- or second-degree relatives; the presence of a large number of nevi (>50), as ",
