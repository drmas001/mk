"), which classically presents as a pink, pearly, or translucent dome-shaped papule with telangiectatic vessels. As the lesion grows, the central area often ulcerates, creating the characteristic rolled edge. An important clue to the diagnosis of BCC is a changing skin lesion, including ulceration or erosion, that spontaneously bleeds. Flecks of melanin pigment are commonly present. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. BCC rarely metastasizes, but it can cause significant local tissue destruction."

SCCs tend to be scalier and grow more rapidly than BCCs and are occasionally tender. They lack the pearliness and telangiectasias seen in BCCs, making SCC unlikely in this patient. They are particularly common in the setting of immunosuppression. SCCs are more aggressive than BCCs and have a much higher tendency to metastasize."
