Although patients may refuse treatment from a specific clinician, patients do not have the right to demand or refuse clinically irrelevant clinician characteristics, because these demands result in unequal working conditions for clinicians. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 indicates that all health care employees have the right to a workplace that is free from discrimination based on religion, race, color, sex, and national origin."

"There may be clinically or ethically appropriate reasons to comply with a request that initially appears bigoted or racist, and it is the physician's responsibility to determine the rationale for the request. For example, the patient may have delirium, dementia, or psychosis, or he or she may lack decision-making capacity. For example, further discussion may reveal that the patient fears triggering a posttraumatic flashback when interacting with clinicians of certain ethnic background (e.g., a veteran of the Vietnam War interacting with a clinician of Asian ethnicity), and it may be appropriate to accommodate his request."

If exploration of the patient's reasons uncovers a racist or bigoted perspective, a patient may be told, for example, “You will treat all members of your care team with respect and refrain from using expletives or hurtful language.”"
