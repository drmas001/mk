") for this patient before cataract surgery. Preoperative testing can help define risks before undergoing a procedure and is intended to guide management. However, there is considerable overuse of preoperative testing, particularly in low-risk procedures. When determining appropriate preoperative testing for elective procedures, the first branch-point is determining the risk of surgery. In general, low-risk surgeries (such as skin surgeries, hernia repair, cataract surgery, and arthroscopy) are of shorter duration, involve local anesthetics, incur minimal blood loss, and are associated with few complications (<1% major adverse cardiac events). Multiple studies have shown that preoperative testing has little value in low-risk procedures. Even when patients have substantial comorbidities, such as this patient, chest radiography, echocardiography, and ECG do not predict cardiac complications. Therefore, provided medical issues are stable, preoperative testing is not recommended for low-risk procedures."
