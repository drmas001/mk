Laboratory identification of ESBLs is difficult because they are a heterogeneous group of enzymes. ESBL-producing gram-negative organisms are capable of hydrolyzing higher generation cephalosporins that have an oxyimino side chain such as cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefepime. The carbapenem class of antibiotics (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem) is the preferred group of agents for treating infections with ESBL-producing organisms. Ertapenem has an advantage over the other carbapenems with once-daily dosing, but some ESBL-producing organisms are resistant to it."
