A large multicenter, observational study of HIV serodiscordant couples (including same-sex and heterosexual couples) showed no transmissions of HIV during condomless sex from effectively treated HIV-positive to HIV-negative partners. Several other studies have similarly shown that HIV-positive persons with sustained viral suppression do not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. This is described as “Undetectable = Untransmittable” (U = U), which was endorsed by the CDC in 2017. The most important factor is that the HIV-positive partner is consistently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieves viral suppression, maintaining an undetectable viral load for at least 6 months. U = U has been particularly endorsed to minimize stigma around HIV, and it is encouraged that physicians involved in the care of persons with HIV share this important update with their patients."

"). Aspiration pneumonia is estimated to account for 5% to 15% of CAP occurrences. This patient has multiple risk factors for aspiration, including residence in a nursing home, neurologic impairment, vomiting, and the presence of a percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tube. Suctioning of tube feed material confirms aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs, although a witnessed or confirmed aspiration event is rare. Among patients with gastrostomy tubes, chronic low-grade aspiration of oropharyngeal contents is the most common risk factor for aspiration pneumonia, which remains the leading cause of death in this population. New insights into the pathophysiology of CAP have identified that aspiration is not restricted to patients with classic risk factors (e.g., dysphagia, neurologic dysfunction, or gastroesophageal reflux disease). Silent aspiration is recognized as a common phenomenon, and most CAP infections result from microaspiration of bacteria colonizing the respiratory tract. Aspiration pneumonia occurs along a continuum and represents macroaspiration of a larger quantity of material in patients who are unable to protect their airway. Recent studies have also found that the microbiology of aspiration pneumonia is similar to other causes of CAP, with oropharyngeal flora such as ",

The absence of a history of genital or oral ulcers does not exclude the possibility of syphilis because chancres are painless and may heal spontaneously without being noticed. Because the patient has a documented history of syphilis, it is expected that an enzyme immunoassay result would remain positive; however, the significant increase in the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer indicates a new infection. In this transgender woman at high risk for STI, if she were unlikely to return for follow up, the clinical presentation would support providing empiric therapy for syphilis before laboratory results returned. This patient should be counseled about the risk for STIs related to unprotected oral sex, and condoms and dental dams should be recommended to reduce this risk. The patient should have follow-up syphilis serology testing at 6 and 12 months, with an expected four-fold decrease in the RPR titer by 12 months."

Because laboratory studies are nonspecific, diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion in a patient with appropriate risk factors and evidence of tissue invasion, including the characteristic appearance of broad, nonseptate hyphae with acute-angle branches."

"). Lyme disease accounts for up to 25% of cases of facial nerve palsy in endemic areas during summer months. Facial nerve palsy caused by neuroborreliosis can be unilateral or bilateral and may present alone or overlap with meningitis. Without previously documented or concurrent erythema migrans, laboratory testing is necessary to distinguish facial palsy resulting from Lyme disease from Bell palsy (idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy). Laboratory confirmation of Lyme disease employs a two-tiered serologic algorithm. In patients with a positive or equivocal screening enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or indirect fluorescent antibody test, a secondary confirmatory EIA (previously, Western blot was most common) is performed. A positive IgM antibody with a negative IgG antibody can occur early in the course of infection when insufficient time has passed for IgG seroconversion, as is the case in this patient. The IgG almost invariably becomes positive within 4 weeks of symptom onset; after this time period, a negative IgG Western blot excludes a diagnosis of Lyme disease. A sequential EIA test that reacts with a different bacterial epitope has been approved as an alternative confirmatory test and may eventually replace the Western blot as the preferred assay."

However, the presence of pyuria is a nonspecific finding, is not a symptom of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and should not be interpreted as an indication for antibiotic treatment. The next step should be to determine if the patient has any additional evidence-based symptoms of CAUTI such as hematuria, rigors, flank pain, pelvic discomfort, or suprapubic pain; after removal of the urinary catheter, the presence of urgency, frequency, or dysuria should be determined as well. This patient had no symptoms of CAUTI other than fever. The next question should be whether the patient had any other diagnosis that could account for the fever. In this case, the normal physical examination and stability of the vital signs other than temperature suggest that the fever could be a postoperative fever. Postoperative fever is mediated by cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-γ released following surgical stress. The median time to peak temperature is 11 hours, and half of patients have a temperature exceeding 38 °C (100.4 °F). Most fevers resulting from surgical stress resolve spontaneously after several hours; those related to surgery for severe trauma may persist for days."

A large prospective, randomized clinical trial has resolved controversy over whether to start ART in asymptomatic patients with normal CD4 cell counts, demonstrating clear clinical benefit. Waiting for the CD4 cell count to drop below 350/µL was shown to put patients at risk for harm from AIDS and non–AIDS-related complications (",

"). HIV treatment guidelines recommend immediate ART initiation (either the same day as or within 2 weeks of diagnosis) if no medical contraindications (concomitant opportunistic infection in which immediate ART may be harmful) or structural barriers (staffing and linkage to care service availability) prevent doing so. The World Health Organization also endorses ART initiation within 7 days of new diagnosis (including same day), citing improved viral suppression. Transmitted drug resistance mutations have been a concern, and standard practice was to initiate ART only after genotyping data were available. However, this is changing as the rate of transmitted drug resistance mutations continues to fall. Many experts recommend initiating three-drug ART without waiting for genotyping results, especially if no barriers prevent immediate initiation. Updated guidelines have added select two-drug ART as a potential option for initial treatment of HIV infection; however, this should only be considered for individuals with HIV RNA less than 500,000 copies/mL, no hepatitis B co-infection, and available HIV reverse transcriptase genotypic resistance testing results. With immediate or rapid start, when genotype data are unavailable, a three-drug ART regimen is recommended."

Postexposure prophylactic antibiotic therapy must begin immediately after any local or systemic infection has been excluded. Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are the preferred first-line agents. Doxycycline is the safer choice in this patient, who has a history of tendon repair, because of the association of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone options (levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) with the risk of tendinopathy. Because antibiotics are only active against vegetative bacilli, they are administered for 60 days, helping to ensure that late germination of spores lying dormant in the lungs and macrophages does not evolve into active disease.

"). Several factors influence determining a causative pathogen in an organ transplant recipient. Knowing the timeline of common posttransplant infections is helpful, as is donor and recipient serostatus for infections like cytomegalovirus. The degree of risk and probability of an infection can also be determined by the patient's current prophylaxis. Because this patient was cytomegalovirus negative and the donor was seropositive, the patient was at very high risk for cytomegalovirus infection and its end-organ complications. He received 6 months of prophylaxis, which helped prevent early-onset cytomegalovirus infection and disease from the donor organ. However, when prophylaxis is stopped and immunosuppression is ongoing, late-onset cytomegalovirus infection and disease is a risk. Cytomegalovirus infection can cause retinitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, colitis, esophagitis, and adrenalitis in immunocompromised persons. Therefore, new-onset fever and malaise with laboratory evidence of cytopenia and liver enzyme elevation should prompt consideration for primary cytomegalovirus infection."

BK virus typically causes more localized complications in kidney transplant recipients, especially tubulointerstitial nephritis and nephropathy. Similarly, syndromes caused by JC virus tend to be localized to the central nervous system. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is the most common presentation of JC virus infection; however, these infections are rare and are only seen in patients who have had more intense immunosuppression related to advancing age, other comorbidities, and frequent episodes of rejection. Patients present with focal neurologic deficits or seizures and have characteristic white matter changes on brain MRI. Polyomaviruses are unlikely to cause a syndrome like cytomegalovirus infection, including cytopenia and liver enzyme elevation."

Cavitary lung disease is seen classically in middle-aged, or older adult men, especially those with underlying lung disease, such as COPD, who smoke cigarettes. Additionally, because of the relatively indolent nature of MAC lung disease, lung destruction may be quite extensive at the time of diagnosis with very large cavities on chest radiograph. The infection is frequently associated with weight loss and night sweats. The chest radiograph generally reveals classic fibrocavitary changes, and respiratory secretions stain positive for acid-fast bacilli. The patient's negative interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) further supports a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The definitive diagnosis would be achieved by nucleic acid amplification testing or molecular probe to further identify the mycobacteria and grow the organism for susceptibility testing. A variant of MAC lung disease seen in women older than 50 years who develop bronchiectasis is termed nodular or bronchiectatic MAC because nodules and bronchiectasis are typically seen on chest radiograph."

The risk of surgical site infection (SSI) associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy is lower than that with open cholecystectomy, but acute cholecystitis or common bile duct stones significantly increases the risk of SSI with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Most SSIs occur within 30 days following surgery (90 days for surgery involving placement of an implant). SSIs are categorized as superficial incisional, deep incisional, and deep/organ space infections. Deep incisional (involving fascia and/or muscle layers) SSIs and deep/organ space (tissue deep to the fascia) infections usually present with systemic signs of infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Differentiating between the two types of infection based on examination alone can be difficult, so imaging is necessary. CT is useful for identifying deep/organ space SSI abscesses and planning necessary drainage procedures, including obtaining material for culture to guide definitive antibiotic therapy. Bacteremia may occur with deep/organ space infections, so blood cultures should also be considered."

The CVC insertion bundle includes hand hygiene; use of full barrier precautions (large full-body sterile drape to cover the patient during catheter insertion) and personal protective equipment (mask, cap, sterile gown, and gloves); chlorhexidine skin antisepsis (allow antiseptic to air dry before beginning procedure); optimal site selection and catheter type (e.g., minimum number of ports or lumens needed); sterile dressing; and daily review of necessity, with prompt removal of unnecessary catheters. The daily review of line necessity and documentation can be achieved with multidisciplinary rounds, daily reminders, and automated alerts. These practices are important in decreasing the risk of developing CLABSIs. Additionally, hand hygiene before manipulation of the intravenous system, care of injection ports, and proper catheter site dressing monitoring and dressing changes reduce risk of infection. Not following these measures increases the risk for development of a CLABSI."

CSF findings include an increased leukocyte count (mainly lymphocytes), an increased protein level, a low to normal glucose level, and the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Serum cryptococcal antigen is positive in greater than 95% of infected patients. Because the mortality rate is more than 50% in healthy patients, combination antifungal therapy should be initiated immediately. After successful induction therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine, consolidation therapy with fluconazole can be initiated. Many symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may be improved by CSF removal through daily lumbar puncture or insertion of a shunt.

For moderate severity cellulitis, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends intravenous antibiotics directed against β-hemolytic streptococci, including penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, or clindamycin. Nonpurulent skin infections include erysipelas and cellulitis. Erysipelas refers to infection of the epidermis, upper dermis, and superficial lymphatics. Usually involving the face or lower extremities, this infection is brightly erythematous with distinct, elevated borders and associated fever, lymphangitis, and regional lymphadenopathy. Cellulitis refers to infection involving the deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue. Inflammatory signs of infection are similar to erysipelas, but the area of involvement is less well demarcated. For immunocompetent patients with cellulitis or erysipelas who have no systemic signs or symptoms (i.e., mild infection), oral therapy, including penicillin VK, cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or clindamycin, directed against streptococci is recommended."

Some patients become comatose. Japanese encephalitis may also present as mild, febrile, aseptic meningitis. Thalamic lesions seen on MRI scans are typical; diagnosis is confirmed by early detection of IgM antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid, and later in the serum.

Valacyclovir, acyclovir, and famciclovir are all acceptable antiviral regimens for management of recurrent genital HSV and will shorten the duration of this episode. Antiviral therapy for recurrent infection is recommended within 1 day of lesion onset or at the onset of prodromal symptoms. Regardless of the antiviral agent used, treatment regimens for recurrent genital HSV are short (2-5 days). The patient should be counseled that she may experience subsequent recurrences, and she can be provided with a prescription for antiviral therapy to begin immediately if she experiences another recurrence. Long-term suppressive therapy is an option if she experiences frequent subsequent recurrences or if she desires to reduce the potential for transmission to a future sexual partner who does not have HSV-2 infection. She should be counseled regarding the importance of informing future sexual partners of her diagnosis and the potential for viral shedding and transmission even without active lesions. HSV-2 seropositive persons are at increased risk for HIV acquisition, so the importance of condoms should be stressed."

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend initiating antiviral treatment as soon as possible for adults with documented or suspected influenza who are hospitalized and for outpatients with severe or progressive illness regardless of illness duration. Treatment should also be initiated as soon as possible for all other patients at high risk for influenza-related complications such as older adults and immunosuppressed persons, such as this patient. Treatment can also be considered for otherwise healthy outpatients if started within 48 hours, household contacts of severely immunosuppressed patients, and health care workers who care for patients at high risk of developing complications from influenza. Neuraminidase inhibitors have activity against influenza A and B. They can be given orally (oseltamivir), intranasally (zanamivir), or intravenously (peramivir). Baloxavir is a polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitor that can be given as single-dose therapy for uncomplicated influenza. It must be started within 48 hours of symptom onset and appears to be as effective as a 5-day course of oseltamivir."

Atypical lymphocytosis and aminotransferase level elevations are clues to the diagnosis, which is established by the presence of heterophile antibodies (Monospot test) or IgM to the EBV viral capsid antigen. The Monospot test result may be negative in the first week of illness. Treatment is supportive; glucocorticoids may be given to patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, central nervous system involvement, or tonsillar enlargement with a compromised airway.

Approximately 60% to 90% of adults have latent cytomegalovirus infection, with reactivation of disease common in persons who are immunosuppressed (e.g., patients with AIDS, transplant recipients, patients taking glucocorticoids). Cytomegalovirus is a significant pathogen in solid organ transplant recipients. The risk of cytomegalovirus infection is highest when a seronegative recipient (one who has never had a cytomegalovirus infection) receives a solid organ from a seropositive donor. Cytomegalovirus can cause retinitis (especially in persons with AIDS), pneumonitis, hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, colitis with bloody diarrhea (such as in this patient), esophagitis, and adrenalitis. This patient underwent liver transplantation and has bloody diarrhea consistent with cytomegalovirus reactivation. Diagnosis relies on isolation of the virus from bodily fluids, such as serum; detection of cytomegalovirus p65 antigen in leukocytes; cytopathic demonstration of “owl's eye” intracellular inclusions from tissue biopsy; polymerase chain reaction; and serologic assays."

"). Cytomegalovirus is an important pathogen in transplant recipients, and the risk of cytomegalovirus infection depends on the serologic status of the patient. The highest risk occurs when a seronegative recipient obtains a graft from a cytomegalovirus-seropositive donor because the recipient lacks cytomegalovirus-specific immunity that can protect them from primary cytomegalovirus infection from the donor organ. Cytomegalovirus infection can develop in up to 70% of patients who are cytomegalovirus-seropositive if prophylaxis is not given. Cytomegalovirus infection can cause retinitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, colitis with bloody diarrhea, esophagitis, and adrenalitis. Cytomegalovirus is an immunomodulatory virus (active infection also results in nonspecific changes in immune system function), and cytomegalovirus reactivation is associated with organ rejection, secondary infection, and an increased risk for graft loss and death. Diagnosis relies on detection of cytomegalovirus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (serum, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchioalveolar lavage, or vitreous fluid sample), detection of cytomegalovirus p65 antigen in leukocytes, or by cytopathic demonstration of “owl's eye” intracellular inclusions or positive immunohistochemical stains from tissue biopsy. Severe infection is treated with intravenous ganciclovir; milder disease can be treated with oral valganciclovir and avoids the potential hazard of central line infection. Oral valganciclovir is also used as prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy (treat if the PCR serum testing result converts to positive) in transplant recipients."

Reasons for infection despite immunization include an inability to mount an immunologic response or discordance between vaccine strains and those circulating in the community.

Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommend starting oseltamivir in all adults with CAP and laboratory-confirmed influenza independent of symptom duration. Therefore, a positive rapid influenza NAAT would influence management, and testing should be performed routinely on patients with CAP during seasons when influenza activity is present in the community."

Symptom onset may be sudden, with chills and fever, severe headache, joint and back pain, malaise, and overall lethargy. Intermittent fever with periods of remission lasting several weeks is common and may persist for months. Depression is commonly reported. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are frequently detected on physical examination. Cytopenias and abnormal liver chemistry results are nonspecific laboratory findings. Diagnosis is best made by isolation of the bacteria from blood cultures; however, the rate of detection is variable. The organism may also be isolated from bone marrow culture, especially in chronic disease. Serologic testing is often relied on when cultures are negative."

In the United States and at centers with access to optimal antifungal therapy (amphotericin B) and the ability to monitor clinical status and intracranial pressure (including assessments for repeat lumbar puncture for drainage), ART can be started between 2 and 10 weeks of HIV diagnosis while the patient receives antifungal therapy. However, cautious monitoring for complications, including ICP and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, would be paramount in these cases. If that is not feasible, ART initiation should be delayed until 10 weeks of cryptococcal meningitis treatment has been completed. Additionally, patients who are prescribed abacavir must first undergo testing to show they are HLA-B*57:01 negative to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity."

A careful, detailed history is the first step in evaluating a patient with FUO. The history should be repeated at each visit because subtle clues may be revealed only with repeated questioning. A complete medical, occupational, and social history should be elicited followed by a careful comprehensive examination to guide further testing. When the initial evaluation is unrevealing, CT of the abdomen and pelvis (with and without contrast) should be obtained. When imaging results are normal, continued clinical observation is the appropriate next step.

VZV reactivation (shingles) presents with pain or paresthesias in a specific dermatome; the characteristic rash develops several days later. In order of frequency, the thoracic, trigeminal, lumbar, and cervical cutaneous dermatomes are most often involved. VZV can present without the typical vesicular rash (zoster sine herpete), the absence of which should not deter physicians from ordering polymerase chain reaction testing for VZV in the appropriate clinical settings (e.g., central nervous system infections). Immunosuppressed patients, including pregnant women, can present with multiple dermatomes affected (disseminated cutaneous disease) or with disseminated visceral disease, which is associated with a high mortality rate. Patients with disseminated cutaneous disease may have disseminated visceral disease. Disseminated cutaneous zoster may also appear as a generalized eruption. Most patients with VZV can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral medications. However, immunocompromised patients with disseminated or otherwise severe herpes zoster should be admitted to the hospital for intravenous acyclovir."

Fluoroquinolones also carry a two-fold increased risk of rupture and dissection of the aorta; they should be avoided in persons who have an aortic aneurysm or are at risk for an aortic aneurysm (e.g., older adults and those with peripheral atherosclerotic vascular diseases, uncontrolled hypertension, certain genetic conditions) unless no other treatment options are available."

A delay in acyclovir initiation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The MRI typically shows unilateral temporal lobe enhancement rather than basal ganglia involvement."

She is immunocompromised and at very high risk for EBV-related complications (donor and recipient EBV and cytomegalovirus mismatch at the time of transplantation, recent intensification of immunosuppression). Her history of weight loss and presence of a mediastinal mass on imaging is also worrisome for malignancy. It is likely that she acquired primary EBV infection from the donated heart in the first year after transplantation, which may have presented as a mononucleosis-like syndrome. Afterward, intensification of ongoing immunosuppression would be the most significant factor in development of PTLD related to EBV infection. A substantial increase in the EBV viral load supports the diagnosis, which can be confirmed with tissue biopsy of the mediastinal mass or involved lymph nodes. Management of EBV-related complications, including PTLD, focuses primarily on reducing immunosuppression; antiviral therapy is not effective. Late-onset PTLD can also be EBV negative."

However, bony abnormalities may not appear for 2 or more weeks after onset of infection. Although no bone is visible in the ulcer base, and the metal probe-to-bone test is negative (positive predictive value of nearly 90% for osteomyelitis), the latter only has a negative predictive value of about 60%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 70 mm/h and ulcers larger than 2 × 2 cm are associated with an increased likelihood of osteomyelitis. This patient also has a leukocytosis, although up to two thirds of patients with osteomyelitis may have a normal leukocyte count. In patients with highly suspected osteomyelitis and a normal radiograph, MRI with and without intravenous contrast is the most accurate imaging study for evaluating diabetic foot osteomyelitis. In addition, it can better delineate the soft tissue involvement, including evidence of necrosis, abscess, and sinus tracts, allowing for better decision making regarding potential surgical intervention."

Patients with viral meningitis may present with a neutrophilic pleocytosis in the first 24 to 48 hours, which typically becomes lymphocytic predominant. Most patients have typical meningitis symptoms such as fever, nuchal rigidity, headache, and photophobia. HSV-2 is more commonly associated with meningitis, occurs year round, and is the most common cause of recurrent meningitis (recurrent benign lymphocytic meningitis). Outcomes for HSV-2 meningitis are generally favorable without the need for acyclovir therapy."

Patients who are female and older than 50 years are at increased risk for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI); a serum creatinine level greater than 2 mg/dL (177 µmol/L) in this population is also a risk factor.

Accurate monitoring of urine output in a critically ill patient is an accepted indication, but this patient is not critically ill. Her fluid status can be assessed by other means (e.g., weight), or the urine may be collected in another manner to measure output. Her history of urinary incontinence alone is also not an indication for an indwelling urinary catheter. Indwelling urinary catheters may be used in the management of stage III or IV or unstageable perineal or sacral pressure ulcers in patients who are incontinent. External catheters (e.g., condom catheters for men or female external urinary collection device with suction for women) can be used for patients with incontinence or increased urination (e.g., diuretic treatment) when frequent toileting does not adequately address the issue.

" conidia initially invade pulmonary blood vessels and cause distal infarction of tissue. Patients generally have fever, cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis at presentation; this is usually seen in immunosuppressed patients with neutropenia. Pulmonary infection involves infiltrates, thin-walled cavities, nodules, or wedge-shaped densities resembling infarcts that may be seen on chest radiographs or CT scans. In this person, the ground-glass appearance surrounding the nodule indicates hemorrhage into the surrounding lung tissue (halo sign). In the appropriate clinical setting, the halo sign may indicate the presence of aspergillosis or other angioinvasive fungal infection, including fusariosis and mucormycosis. Other sites of involvement include the central nervous system, skin, and eye. Profound and prolonged neutropenia, especially in association with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy, is a risk factor for invasive aspergillosis; solid organ transplant recipients are also at increased risk. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy are the most effective methods for definitive diagnosis. In patients with pulmonary disease, the BAL and serum galactomannan assay have excellent sensitivity and specificity (both >80%) in patients with hematologic malignancies or following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."

In general, immune reconstitution with combination ART is the cornerstone of management for patients with HIV-associated cryptosporidiosis. However, symptom resolution, which typically occurs at significantly higher CD4 cell counts (>100/µL), may be delayed, so patients with persistent and debilitating diarrhea can be given nitazoxanide. If uncontrolled, particularly in persons with advanced HIV disease, cryptosporidiosis can cause profound wasting, with associated malaise, crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever.

Mucormycosis has five major clinical forms: (1) rhinocerebral; (2) pulmonary; (3) abdominal, pelvic, gastric, gastrointestinal; (4) primary cutaneous; and (5) disseminated. The presence of oral necrotic lesions strongly indicates an invasive mucor infection in this patient. This patient has left eye proptosis, with accompanying ptosis of the upper lid, and generalized palpebral swelling and erythema, and left facial drooping. Signs of orbital infection include periorbital edema, proptosis, and blindness. Spread from the sphenoid sinuses to the adjacent cavernous sinus can result in cranial nerve palsies (cranial nerve VII in this case), sinus thrombosis, and carotid artery involvement. Definitive diagnosis frequently requires a biopsy with histopathologic examination, which is the most sensitive form of diagnosis. Treatment requires reversal of any predisposing condition, extensive surgical removal of affected tissue, and early antifungal therapy. Initial treatment is high-dose liposomal amphotericin B, with later de-escalation to posaconazole or isavuconazonium sulfate."

The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is nonspecific; however, based on the clinical presentation, acute osteomyelitis must be considered. Because her symptom duration is greater than 2 weeks, plain radiography may be used to investigate the possibility of osteomyelitis. Plain radiographs are not sufficiently sensitive to exclude the diagnosis, but the findings of cortical destruction accompanied by periosteal reaction, especially when a previous radiograph is available for comparison, are sufficiently specific to confirm the diagnosis and proceed with bone biopsy to establish a microbiologic diagnosis and guide antibiotic therapy selection. Acute osteomyelitis in adults requires a prolonged therapy duration (generally 6 weeks), so guiding antibiotic therapy using bone biopsy culture results is optimal to ensure that the selected therapy is effective."

Fourth generation HIV testing uses a combination assay for HIV antibody and HIV p24 antigen, which detects acute infection at least 1 week earlier than older assays. A positive result on the combination assay leads to testing with an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, which, if positive, confirms infection. Specimens that test positive on the initial combination assay but negative for HIV antibody are tested for HIV RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing; if positive, acute HIV infection is confirmed, and a negative result identifies a false-positive HIV antibody and HIV p24 combination assay. Although the initial combination assay has a 99.6% specificity, testing in low prevalence populations can result in false positives, so waiting for the results of the confirmatory antibody differentiation immunoassay and nucleic acid amplification testing is important. This patient does not have HIV infection, and safe sexual practice counseling should be reinforced."

Commonly encountered risk factors for candidemia include central venous or hemodialysis-associated catheters, gastrointestinal surgery, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, ICU stay or mechanical ventilation for more than 3 days, transplantation, and neutropenia. Only 40% to 60% of patients have positive blood culture results. The T2 magnetic resonance assay of whole blood provides rapid diagnosis of culture-negative invasive candidal infections. The β-D-glucan assay can be used also to diagnose invasive candidiasis in patients with negative blood culture results. These assays should be obtained when a patient at high risk receiving antimicrobial agents is not responding to therapy."

Cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy may also be associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery, so treatment is indicated. Pending culture and susceptibility results, initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy is indicated. The recommended treatment duration for cystitis in pregnancy is generally 3 to 7 days. A single dose of fosfomycin is a suitable but more costly alternative. Other than in pregnant women, test of cure is not indicated in those reporting symptom resolution. Follow-up urine cultures shortly after successful treatment completion are indicated in pregnant patients, with retreatment as needed.

Disseminated tuberculosis often involves the lungs, liver, and bone marrow. The patient's chest radiograph reveals the bilateral presence of innumerable 1- to 3-mm nodules. These findings, although not specific, are typical of tuberculosis dissemination through the vasculature or the lymphatic vessels. She also has pancytopenia, an indication of bone marrow involvement, and increased alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferase levels indicate hepatic involvement. Finally, her high fever, increased heart rate and respiration rate, and hypotension are also signs of sepsis.

PrEP is recommended for populations in which annual HIV incidence is at least 2%, which applies to men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States, especially with risk factors previously described. With good adherence, the efficacy of daily PrEP in MSM can be as high as 92%. A fourth generation HIV antigen/antibody combination assay should be performed within 7 days of PrEP initiation and repeated every 3 months; additionally, sexually transmitted infection screening should be done every 3 months, and serum creatinine should be evaluated every 6 months. Since 2012, the coformulation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine has been used for prevention and has been found to be safe overall, aside from a low risk of kidney dysfunction and reduced bone mineral density. Because of this, TDF and emtricitabine is not recommended for persons with a creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning is recommended in men older than 50 years and others at risk for osteoporosis. A second PrEP regimen, daily tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine, with a presumed lower risk of kidney and bone-related adverse effects, was approved in 2019 for use in men at high risk of HIV infection."

Obstructive upper airway issues and diaphragmatic weakness can lead to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Deep tendon reflexes can become diminished, but sensation remains intact. Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal manifestation but may be preceded by nausea and mild diarrhea. Botulism is not a febrile disease; however, alterations in parasympathetic autonomic function commonly occur. Mentation is not altered. No specific diagnostic laboratory abnormalities are associated with botulism. Imaging studies help exclude other neurologic entities. Confirmation relies on detecting toxin in foods, gastric secretions, stool, or serum. Supportive care and prompt administration of heptavalent botulinum antitoxin are the mainstays of management. Botulism can also be acquired by inhalation of purified toxin deliberately released in the air."

Many laboratories use the “reverse” serologic testing strategy for syphilis, starting with an automated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a nonspecific test (rapid plasma reagin [RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Lab [VDRL] test). Patients with a positive EIA result but negative RPR or VDRL test result should have a second specific treponemal antibody test to confirm the result. Those with a confirmed positive result and no history of syphilis treatment should be offered treatment for syphilis of unknown duration with benzathine penicillin once weekly for three doses.
