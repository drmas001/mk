"). This patient is experiencing the manifestations of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which affects 39% of patients with systemic sclerosis. SIBO occurs in both the limited and diffuse cutaneous forms of systemic sclerosis. The most frequent symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea. The diarrhea is often explosive and typically follows a meal. Over time, SIBO can lead to malabsorption, malnutrition, and weight loss. Jejunal aspirate is considered the gold standard but is often not used in clinical practice because of the requirement for endoscopy to obtain cultures and the patchy nature of small intestinal overgrowth. Glucose and lactulose breath tests have acceptable specificity (around 80%) but poor sensitivity (30%-40%) for diagnosing SIBO. Diagnosis requires typical symptoms and a confirmatory test, although empiric antibiotic therapy with monitoring for improvement in symptoms may be reasonable in patients with a high probability of SIBO, such as this patient. The protocol is to a take a different antibiotic with activity against bowel flora (e.g., ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and rifaximin) for the first 10 days of the month for 4 months. Systemic sclerosis affects both smooth muscle and autonomic nerves and leads to small intestine hypomotility. Hypomotility results in food and liquid stasis, which then fosters bacterial overgrowth. SIBO also causes bile acid deconjugation, leading to dietary malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. A low-fat diet may help reduce the intensity of the diarrhea."

Patients with SIBO have bile acid insufficiency, and treatment with a bile acidâ€“binding resin, such as cholestyramine, is likely to worsen this patient's symptoms."
