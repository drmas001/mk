"). Aspiration pneumonia is estimated to account for 5% to 15% of CAP occurrences. This patient has multiple risk factors for aspiration, including residence in a nursing home, neurologic impairment, vomiting, and the presence of a percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tube. Suctioning of tube feed material confirms aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs, although a witnessed or confirmed aspiration event is rare. Among patients with gastrostomy tubes, chronic low-grade aspiration of oropharyngeal contents is the most common risk factor for aspiration pneumonia, which remains the leading cause of death in this population. New insights into the pathophysiology of CAP have identified that aspiration is not restricted to patients with classic risk factors (e.g., dysphagia, neurologic dysfunction, or gastroesophageal reflux disease). Silent aspiration is recognized as a common phenomenon, and most CAP infections result from microaspiration of bacteria colonizing the respiratory tract. Aspiration pneumonia occurs along a continuum and represents macroaspiration of a larger quantity of material in patients who are unable to protect their airway. Recent studies have also found that the microbiology of aspiration pneumonia is similar to other causes of CAP, with oropharyngeal flora such as ",
