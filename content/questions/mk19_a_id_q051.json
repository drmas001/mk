A TST reaction of 5 mm or greater is considered positive in persons at high risk, such as those with HIV, recent or known contacts of a person with active tuberculosis, persons with chronic fibrotic changes on chest radiography consistent with old tuberculosis, patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation, and other persons who are immunosuppressed. A TST reaction of 10 mm or greater should be considered positive in recent arrivals (<5 years) from high-prevalence countries; persons who inject drugs; residents or employees of high-risk settings, hospitals, other health care facilities, and homeless shelters; persons with clinical conditions that put them at high risk for active disease; and children younger than 4 years or those exposed to adults in high-risk categories. In patients with no known risk factors for tuberculosis, a reaction of 15 mm or greater is considered a positive result."
