"). There has been substantial progress in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapeutic agents can be stratified by their emetogenic potential into high, moderate, low, and minimal risk. For patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, such as an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin) combined with cyclophosphamide, standard antiemetic treatments include a four-drug combination of an NK1 receptor antagonist (such as aprepitant or netupitant), a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT",

") receptor antagonist (such as ondansetron, granisetron, or palonosetron), dexamethasone, and olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic). Olanzapine should be continued on days 2 to 4. These drug combinations have markedly reduced the incidence of acute emesis (in the first 24 hours) and improve the risk of delayed emesis (after 24 hours). Olanzapine, when added to standard antiemetic regimens, has been found to be effective for the treatment of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (although some oncologists may not routinely prescribe this as first-line therapy due to the risk of sedation). Other examples of high-emetic-risk chemotherapeutic drugs (vomiting risk >90%) include carmustine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide (>1,500 mg/m",
