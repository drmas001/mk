A comprehensive history of a transgender person is usually not possible to obtain in one visit; it is best obtained over time in order to build rapport with the patient. In general, history taking for transgender persons is the same as for all patients and includes family, reproductive, sexual, psychiatric, and social histories. Elements of the history that are unique to the transgender population are hormonal and surgical therapies related to gender transition."

Just as it would be inappropriate to perform STI screening in a nontransgender patient during a first-time visit for unrelated episodic care, it would also be inappropriate to screen this patient today. STI screening is important and should be performed; however, it can wait until patient rapport has been established and a more detailed history has been obtained to guide screening."
