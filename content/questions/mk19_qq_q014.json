") should be obtained in this patient with recent onset of painful progressive gynecomastia and no clear cause identified on history and physical examination. Gynecomastia is the abnormal growth of large mammary glands in men causing breast enlargement. On physical examination, gynecomastia presents as a rubbery, concentric, subareolar mass. It is typically bilateral and may be tender if early in its course of development. Gynecomastia results from an imbalance in the testosterone-to-estrogen ratio. This imbalance may be caused by a low testosterone level or an elevated estradiol level. Associated conditions include obesity, substance use disorder, malnutrition, cirrhosis, primary or secondary hypogonadism, testicular germ cell tumors, adrenal tumors, hyperthyroidism, and chronic kidney disease. Because the total testosterone level is normal in this patient, an estradiol level must be obtained to check for any elevation."

If the testicular ultrasound shows no neoplasms, adrenal CT should be ordered to exclude an adrenal neoplasm."
