"). She is taking warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist that inhibits vitamin K reductase, and has clinically significant bleeding and an elevated INR. Warfarin levels are monitored by prothrombin time and INR. Typically, a therapeutic warfarin level has an INR of 2 to 3. Bleeding risk increases as the INR level increases, and risk is also elevated in patients older than 75 years, in patients taking an antiplatelet agent, and in patients with previous stroke or gastrointestinal bleeding. For an INR between 4.5 and 10 in patients without bleeding, warfarin can be withheld without other treatment. In patients with an INR greater than 10 without bleeding, oral vitamin K should be given and warfarin withheld until the INR returns to a therapeutic range. However, patients with life-threatening bleeding, as in this patient, should be given 4f-PCC in addition to intravenous vitamin K. 4F-PCC is the preferred agent for warfarin reversal. If 4f-PCC is not available, then 3-factor PCC or fresh frozen plasma can be used. 4F-PCC is preferred over 3-factor PCC because it contains consistent amounts of factor VII and warfarin reversal is more reliable."
