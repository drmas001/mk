Iterative evaluation of depressive symptoms during chronic pain treatment is critical to ensuring that patients sustain improvements.

Medications are a common cause of bilateral lower extremity edema. The most commonly implicated drugs are calcium channel blockers, gabapentin, NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, and thiazolidinediones. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, are associated with lower extremity edema in up to 30% of patients in a dose-dependent fashion. Lower extremity edema occurs because these drugs cause vasodilation, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, which is exacerbated by gravitational forces with standing. The swelling subsides with dose reduction of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or switching to a different class of antihypertensive medication."

Review of the prescription monitoring database before authorizing refills allows the prescribing clinician to monitor patient use patterns and identify requests for early refills as a warning sign of worsening pain or disordered use. It also serves an important function in identifying multiple prescriptions of opioids and other controlled substances. For this patient with chronic pain who has several specialists involved in her care, close monitoring of the database is needed before each prescription. The regulations for checking prescription monitoring databases before opioid prescribing vary by state, and physicians should be familiar with the regulations in the states in which they practice."

"). MUS are symptoms that cannot be attributed to a specific medical cause after a thorough medical evaluation. Common symptoms in patients with MUS include fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain (back pain, myalgia, arthralgia), dizziness, paresthesia, generalized weakness, transient edema, insomnia, dyspnea, chest pain, chronic facial pain, chronic pelvic pain, and chemical sensitivities. The management of MUS focuses on restoring function, decreasing symptom focus, and acquiring coping mechanisms rather than abating symptoms. It should be made clear to patients that treatment of MUS will probably not be curative and that symptoms may persist. A therapeutic alliance and a mutually respectful physician-patient relationship are key features in the successful management of the patient with MUS. In keeping with a patient-centered approach, the patient should be engaged fully in the plan, focusing on physical, psychological, and social aspects of health. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, individual or group psychotherapy, social support, biofeedback therapy, graded exercise therapy, stress management activities, and training in coping mechanisms, are the cornerstone of treatment."

In addition, it is not associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. Varenicline is one of two first-line treatments recommended for hospitalized patients with ACS by the 2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on Tobacco Cessation Treatment. Combination NRT, which includes short-acting (e.g., nicotine inhaler) and long-acting (e.g., nicotine patch) forms, is more effective than nicotine replacement monotherapy and is recommended by the ACC as first-line therapy for hospitalized patients with ACS to decrease nicotine cravings. At the time of hospital discharge, either combination NRT or varenicline is recommended; however, the ACC Expert Pathway notes that some committee members would initiate either varenicline or combination NRT during hospitalization. Combining behavioral counseling with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either modality alone. Effective counseling and behavioral resources include problem-solving guidance (such as developing a quit plan and overcoming barriers), motivational interviewing, social support, and telephone quit lines."

An abbreviated version of CBT-I, brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBT-I), focuses on the behavioral components of sleep restriction, stimulus control, and sleep hygiene only.

Esketamine is a glutamate receptor modulator, which offers a novel mechanism of action for depression treatment. Unlike most other antidepressant therapies, treatment effect is almost immediate; however, there are several barriers to its use. Labeling indications restrict the drug to patients whose symptoms have failed to respond to two courses of appropriately prescribed antidepressant therapy, and patients cannot drive or operate machinery for 24 hours after administration. Esketamine must be administered intranasally in a physician's office under direct supervision, and physicians must be enrolled in an FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program. Esketamine carries a black box warning for dissociation, sedation, and suicidal thoughts. The cost of the month-long induction is very expensive."

Cognitive impairment, defined as a progressive decline in at least two cognitive domains (memory, attention, language, visuospatial function, and executive function) that negatively affects patient functioning, is increasingly common with older age. Cognitive impairment is associated with increased risk for falls and loss of independence and is a barrier to appropriate control of chronic medical conditions. Screening for cognitive impairment is an important component of comprehensive geriatric assessment. Objective in-office screening should be performed when patients or family members report symptoms concerning for cognitive impairment. The Mini-Cog, which consists of a three-item recall test followed by a clock-drawing test if three-item recall is abnormal, has appropriate test characteristics to reliably identify cognitive impairment. On the basis of this patient's symptoms, it is most appropriate to perform Mini-Cog testing."

"). A bunion is a valgus malformation of the great toe that may result in pain and disability. The cause is unknown but has been attributed to wearing shoes with a narrow toe box; however, it can occur in patients who do not customarily wear such shoes. Bunion is diagnosed by inspection of the foot that demonstrates lateral deviation of the toe at the first metatarsal phalangeal (MTP) joint. In some cases, erythema of the joint is observed. A bunion deformity can be associated with several painful complications involving the first MTP joint. The most common cause of pain is bursitis medial to the MTP joint. Other sources of pain may include entrapment of the dorsal cutaneous nerve, synovitis, and generalized metatarsalgia as the patient shifts the distribution of pressure away from the great toe while walking. Radiography is not necessary for the diagnosis of bunion but may be needed to assess for underlying articular damage. Conservative treatment includes orthotic devices, wearing toe separators at night, and analgesics. The evidence supporting the efficacy of these measures is sparse. In some cases of severe pain and disability, surgery may be beneficial."

About 20% of patients with vertebrobasilar stroke present with isolated vertigo, and these symptoms can be misclassified as peripheral vertigo. Clues to the diagnosis are the patient's advanced age, vascular disease risk factors, and constant vertigo. An abnormal result on any one of the three HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew) examination components suggests a central rather than peripheral cause of acute vertigo; this patient demonstrated vertical skew. Patients with central vertigo secondary to vertebrobasilar stroke frequently, but not invariably, display neurologic findings in addition to vertigo, such as this patient's ataxia and postural instability. Urgent brain MRI would confirm the diagnosis. For acute stroke, either noncontrast CT or MRI is recommended to exclude hemorrhage before administration of alteplase. However, this patient has exceeded the 3-hour window for thrombolytic therapy, and hemorrhagic stroke in the territory of the posterior circulation is an unlikely cause of persistent and isolated vertigo. MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke and is the preferred imaging test in this situation."

"). Falls onto outstretched hands resulting in pain in the anatomic snuffbox, especially in male athletes in the second or third decade of life, should raise high clinical suspicion for scaphoid fracture. The location of the scaphoid bone, articulating with the distal radius and four carpal bones, makes it prone to fracture. Because of the complexity of the anatomy, scaphoid fractures are often missed on initial radiographs, which are normal in up to 20% of patients. If scaphoid fracture is suspected and initial radiographs are normal, either splinting with repeat radiography in 1 to 2 weeks or immediate advanced imaging with MRI or CT is indicated. Several studies suggest that immediate MRI or CT is more cost-effective than splinting and repeat radiography when follow-up care, missed fracture, and lost productivity are taken into account. If diagnosed immediately, nondisplaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures may be managed with immobilization of the wrist in a cast or with splinting for 4 to 12 weeks. Undiagnosed, untreated scaphoid fracture may develop into scaphoid nonunion with degeneration of the distal radius, leading to progressive arthritis months to years after the initial injury."

Systematic reviews are systematic literature searches performed by using predefined criteria to collect all relevant studies. The systematic selection of the included studies minimizes bias. The resultant larger sample size has greater power to discriminate differences between groups; thus, meta-analysis increases sample size and statistical power. Meta-analysis of high-quality randomized controlled trials is considered one of the highest levels of clinical evidence. Factors that limit the ability to combine study results meaningfully include differences in the study populations, research measures, and statistical techniques. These differences are termed heterogeneity. This systematic review had differences in patient populations that included more advanced disease, sicker patients, and variability in previous treatment before inclusion in the study."

Posterior hip pain associated with positive results on the FADIR (Flexion, ADduction, and Internal Rotation) test, as seen in this patient, strongly suggests osteoarthritis. Examples of extra-articular causes of posterior hip pain include lumbar radiculopathy, vascular claudication, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and gluteal tendinopathy. Pain associated with radiation down the leg suggests lumbar radiculopathy, whereas concomitant exertional leg pain or peripheral vascular disease suggests vascular claudication. These causes of posterior hip pain are not associated with positive results on the FADIR test. Acetabular labrum injury (labrum tear) is an example of an extra-articular cause of anterior hip pain; osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis are examples of intra-articular causes. Anterior or posterior hip pain that starts insidiously and worsens with standing and activity in older patients suggests osteoarthritis. The same pain characteristics in a younger person with anterior hip pain raise concern for a labral tear, especially when accompanied by painful clicking or catching. Gradual onset of anterior hip pain can also occur with avascular necrosis (or osteonecrosis), which should be considered in the presence of alcohol abuse, glucocorticoid use, systemic lupus erythematosus, or sickle cell anemia."

Important aspects to obtain in the history include the presence of reversible factors, the situation in which the syncopal event occurred, and any symptoms present before and after the syncopal event. A thorough medical history and medication history should be obtained, with an emphasis on history of cardiac disease. A family history also should be obtained, focusing on any history of syncope or sudden unexplained death, including drowning. Physical examination should include a thorough cardiovascular examination, with orthostatic blood pressure measurement in three positions and cardiac auscultation. A basic neurologic examination should also be performed. ECG should be included in the initial evaluation of syncope as a tool to identify potentially life-threatening causes of cardiac syncope."

After starting pharmacologic therapy for depression with a low dosage of the selected medication, the medication should be gradually titrated to achieve a clinical response while monitoring for adverse effects. Therapeutic response can be measured objectively with the PHQ-9 by comparing scores before and during treatment. A decrease in the score of at least 50% indicates a response to treatment; a decrease to a score of less than 5 indicates remission. If a partial response occurs, as it did in this case, increasing the dosage of the chosen medication or adding psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), may be appropriate. Approximately half of patients who respond to appropriate initial therapy develop recurrent depression after 1 year without continued treatment. Continuation therapy (treatment after resolution of a major depressive episode) for 4 to 9 months is recommended in patients who responded to acute therapy. The antidepressant dosage that was effective in acute treatment should be maintained in the continuation phase, and if psychotherapy was used, it should be continued."

These characteristics distinguish binge eating disorder from overeating. The main treatment for binge eating disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Because this patient's symptoms have persisted while she is engaged in CBT, medical therapy can be considered. A systematic review found that CBT, lisdexamfetamine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and topiramate all reduced binge eating. Lisdexamfetamine and topiramate reduced weight in adults with binge eating disorder and should be considered for this patient, who has partial response to CBT and an SSRI. Side effects are common with lisdexamfetamine and include headache, gastrointestinal upset, and sleep disturbance. Lisdexamfetamine has been shown to reduce the frequency of binge eating days and is FDA approved to treat binge eating disorder. Topiramate is not FDA approved for this indication.

An absolute contraindication to compression therapy is an ABI of 0.5 or less, although cautious use is advised for any patient with an ABI less than 0.9. There are many options for compression therapy, including multilayered elastic bandage systems, elastic compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression (dynamic compression). Static compression with a zinc oxide paste bandage (e.g., Unna boot) is not as effective as elastic compression or dynamic compression in venous ulcer healing. At times, the choice is determined by the ability of the compression system to accommodate the bulk of the wound dressing. Specialty compression stockings that include a zipper may increase patient adherence and, like multilayered elastic bandage systems, may be easier to apply in the presence of bulky dressings."

ITBS also can occur in competitive cyclists who pedal against resistance. The Noble test consists of repeated flexion and extension of the supine patient's knee with the thumb over the lateral femoral condyle. If this test reproduces the pain, the result is considered diagnostic. Imaging is not necessary to diagnose ITBS. Initial treatment of ITBS involves abstaining from inciting activities and use of ice, followed by a gradual return to activity, stretching, strengthening, and local massage."

Meniscal injury can be differentiated from ITBS by a positive result on the McMurray or Thessaly test and a negative Noble test result. The McMurray test is performed with the patient supine. The examiner fully flexes the knee and rotates the tibia externally. The knee is then extended with the hand over the medial joint line. The maneuver is then repeated with the tibia internally rotated and the hand over the lateral joint line. Snapping detected over the joint line with extension of the knee is a positive result for meniscal injury. The Thessaly test for meniscal tear is performed by holding the patient's outstretched hands while the patient stands on the uninjured leg with the knee flexed to 5 degrees; the other knee is flexed with the foot off the floor. The patient rotates the body internally and externally on the knee three times. The test is repeated with the knee flexed to 20 degrees. This process is repeated with the injured knee. Medial or lateral joint line pain is a positive result for meniscal tear."

PTSD also causes functional impairment, hypervigilance, irritability, and sleep disturbance. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the cornerstone of therapy for patients with PTSD; it helps decrease PTSD-associated symptom burden and increase adaptive coping strategies.

Urinary incontinence after activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as sneezing, laughing, physical exertion, or bearing down, is consistent with stress incontinence, which primarily affects multiparous, postmenopausal women. This patient has attempted first-line therapy for stress incontinence with pelvic floor muscle training, without success. Vaginal estrogen formulations may increase continence compared with placebo and should be attempted as second-line therapy for postmenopausal women with stress incontinence. Evidence from clinical trials is generally of low quality, and statistical heterogeneity limits confidence in conclusions. However, because this patient is experiencing genitourinary symptoms of menopause (vaginal dryness and dyspareunia), a trial of topical vaginal estrogen is appropriate and reasonable.

The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) syncope guideline recommends assessment for orthostatic hypotension in all patients with syncope. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or greater or a drop in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater upon assuming an upright posture. Immediate orthostatic hypotension is a transient blood pressure decrease within 15 seconds after standing. Classic orthostatic hypotension, as manifested by this patient, is characterized by a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater within 3 minutes of standing. Delayed orthostatic hypotension occurs after 3 minutes of standing with a more gradual drop in blood pressure until the threshold for orthostatic hypotension is reached. The risk for medication-related syncope increases with age. Several drug classes are implicated, including diuretics, vasodilators, venodilators, negative chronotropes, and sedatives. The AHA/ACC/HRS syncope guideline recommends reducing or withdrawing medications that may cause hypotension. Careful monitoring following medication adjustment is important because supine hypertension may result from antihypertensive medication reduction or withdrawal."

Unexplained chronic cough is characterized by persistent cough symptoms with no identifiable cause after comprehensive evaluation. A multimodality speech pathology intervention has been shown to reduce cough frequency, improve cough severity, and have a beneficial effect on cough-related quality of life in patients with unexplained chronic cough. The intervention typically consists of two to four sessions of education, cough suppression techniques, breathing exercises, and counseling. It is recommended by the CHEST guideline and expert panel report on the treatment of unexplained chronic cough. Gabapentin is a neuromodulatory agent that may dampen the enhanced neural sensitization that is a key component of unexplained cough. Although it is not FDA approved for this indication, gabapentin can be an effective treatment for unexplained chronic cough. Gabapentin carries significant risk for adverse effects, including dizziness, disequilibrium, somnolence, weight gain, peripheral edema, and cognitive difficulties. In this patient who is younger than 65 years and otherwise healthy, a therapeutic trial of gabapentin is reasonable if the potential harms and benefits are acceptable to the patient. After 6 months of treatment, harms and benefits should be reassessed before continuing gabapentin."

Neuroexcitatory metabolites can accumulate between dialysis treatments, and care still must be taken to prevent toxicity. Although the enteral route should be used whenever possible, parenteral opioids are appropriate for immediate control of severe pain because of their rapid onset of action, within 5 to 15 minutes. After intravenous hydromorphone administration, this patient's underlying condition should be evaluated and treated, and the patient should be rotated to oral opioid therapy once the acute severe pain is controlled.

Current recommendations are to prescribe naloxone to any patient who is receiving more than 50 MME per day, as well as to patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently. Naloxone also should be considered for patients taking opioids with risk factors for opioid-related harms, such as elderly persons; patients with mental health conditions; and patients at risk for sleep-disordered breathing, such as those with heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, or obesity.

This patient has a moderate pretest probability of DVT based on the presence of calf swelling at least 3 cm greater than the opposite leg, and there is no alternative explanation for the symptoms that is more likely than DVT. If there is a high pretest probability of DVT, ultrasonography should be performed as the first step. When there is a low or moderate pretest probability, D-dimer testing should be performed.

Older drivers are at risk for accumulating deficits in multiple areas that affect driving safety, including vision, cognition, and mobility. However, driving is a highly valued instrumental activity of daily living, and cessation of driving is associated with social isolation and depression. The decision to discontinue driving is thus a complex and somewhat subjective assessment that often requires partnering between the patient, family, and clinician. If modifiable risk factors for driving safety are present, interventions to address those risk factors with subsequent reassessment may be an appropriate strategy. In this case, the patient has an abnormal result on the Mini-Cog test. The Mini-Cog is sensitive (76%-100%) but not highly specific (54%-85%) in the diagnosis of dementia. On the basis of this patient's history of MVCs and cognitive impairment, a recommendation to retire from driving is appropriate. This recommendation should be accompanied by a discussion of future transportation, including resources that can be provided by the family and a referral to community resources that would allow her to live independently and continue participating in social activities that are important to her."

Alcohol withdrawal may cause minor symptoms, such as tremulousness, diaphoresis, and palpitations, within 6 hours and hallucinosis and withdrawal seizures within 12 to 48 hours of cessation of alcohol use; symptoms may progress to severe withdrawal (delirium tremens), usually 48 to 96 hours after the last drink. Predictors of severe alcohol withdrawal include a history of delirium tremens and baseline systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher. No single symptom or sign is associated with exclusion of severe alcohol withdrawal. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar), is a commonly used standardized instrument to measure severity of alcohol withdrawal. The CIWA-Ar includes 10 easily observable clinical findings that are summed to create a score. A score less than 8 indicates mild withdrawal, a score of 8 to 15 indicates moderate withdrawal, and a score greater than 15 indicates severe withdrawal. These scores can be used to guide changes in clinical status and medication management. Some patients can be managed safely in the outpatient setting with close follow-up, whereas patients at greater risk for severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms (e.g., history of delirium tremens or seizures, concomitant drug use, elderly persons) should be hospitalized."

It is as efficacious as scheduled or scheduled plus symptom-triggered management in managing symptoms.

Adults aged 40 to 75 years without diabetes mellitus and with an LDL cholesterol level of 70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (1.81-4.90 mmol/L) should undergo risk assessment for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the Pooled Cohort Equations. The 10-year risk for ASCVD can be categorized as low (<5%), borderline (5% to <7.5%), intermediate (â¥7.5% to <20%), or high (â¥20%).

"). This patient has patellofemoral pain syndrome, which is characterized by pain in the knee that can be localized to the patella or behind the patella and classically occurs with activities that involve knee flexion. Common symptoms include pain with running and going up and down stairs. This syndrome most commonly occurs in women and is a common condition in runners. Weak quadriceps muscles may contribute to the onset of patellofemoral pain syndrome. Diagnosis is based on the history and physical examination findings, which include pain with flexion of the knee, such as pain with squatting. Patellofemoral pain syndrome is not associated with effusions or erythema. Further imaging or evaluation is not necessary. NSAIDs may help alleviate symptoms in the acute setting but have not shown benefit in the long term. In the acute phase of injury, modification of activity and cryotherapy (ice, ice water immersion) is recommended. In the recovery phase, the most effective treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome is physical therapy with an exercise program designed to strengthen the quadriceps muscles, hamstrings, and gluteus muscles. Core strengthening exercises also may have benefit. These strengthening exercises should be continued after pain relief."

") to the patient's current medications. Delirium is an acute-onset disorder associated with fluctuation in mental status. It may manifest as either inattention and agitation or hypoactivity. Terminally ill patients often experience delirium, and in elderly patients with cancer, delirium is associated with increased morbidity. Regardless of the presentation of delirium, diagnosis and treatment are indicated to ensure patient safety and to provide comfort to both patient and family. Potentially reversible causes of delirium, such as noise, medication side effects, pain, bladder distention, constipation, and dehydration, should be addressed. There is very little evidence supporting the use of antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, in the treatment of delirium, but they are commonly prescribed. Benzodiazepines are typically avoided for patients at the end of life, primarily because of greater incidence of paradoxical reactions, including worsened delirium. However, recent evidence from clinical trials show a potential benefit with the addition of lorazepam to haloperidol for agitated delirium in hospitalized patients at the end of life. In this case, the patient initially had a positive response to parenteral haloperidol, but it is now ineffective. Given that the goal of therapy is the patient's comfort, a trial of lorazepam and haloperidol would be reasonable at this time."

The anxiety causes significant distress and functional impairment. Diagnosis requires the presence of three of the following physical symptoms: restlessness, being easily fatigued, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. Patients with significant anxiety or multiple unexplained physical symptoms should be screened for GAD using the GAD-7 screening tool. The shorter-form GAD-2 can be administered in less time and may be equivalent to the GAD-7 in screening for GAD in primary care populations. The GAD-2 asks patients how often they have been bothered by âfeeling nervous, anxious, or on edgeâ and ânot being able to stop or control worryingâ over the previous 2 weeks."

Common symptoms in patients with MUS include fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain (back pain, myalgia, arthralgia), dizziness, paresthesia, generalized weakness, transient edema, insomnia, dyspnea, chest pain, chronic facial pain, chronic pelvic pain, and chemical sensitivities. A collaborative therapeutic relationship is essential to providing care for patients with MUS. If an underlying medical cause cannot be identified after an appropriately thorough evaluation, it is imperative that clinicians have an open and honest discussion with the patient. This includes acknowledging the impact of the symptoms and addressing concerns that the patient may be perceived as malingering or presenting with factitious disease. Arranging for regular follow-up can strengthen the therapeutic alliance."

Chronic insomnia is diagnosed by the presence of symptoms that (1) cause substantial functional distress or impairment; (2) occur at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months; and (3) are not associated with other sleep, medical, or mental disorders. Multiple guidelines recommend cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the preferred therapy for chronic insomnia because of its effectiveness and safety. However, some patients will not improve with CBT-I, and others will decline to participate. In those situations, short-term pharmacologic therapy can be considered. Physicians should engage in a thorough shared decision-making process to decide whether to initiate pharmacologic therapy in patients with refractory insomnia. Pharmacologic therapy can be associated with harms, including daytime drowsiness, increased risk for falls and hip fracture, and medication-related hallucinations. The 2020 guideline from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense recommends low-dose doxepin or nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone) in this situation. Low-quality evidence shows improvement in subjective sleep latency, total sleep time, and sleep quality outcomes in patients receiving doxepin compared with placebo.

"). Meclizine is a centrally acting antihistamine associated with increased fall risk in elderly patients. Many health conditions, physical characteristics, and behaviors increase risk for falling, but the greatest increases are associated with cognitive impairment, psychoactive medications, gait/balance problems, and decreased lower extremity strength. The presence of multiple risk factors has an additive effect on fall risk. Even fear of falling in the absence of falls decreases self-rated health and hastens functional decline. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is used to help assess fall risk. This test involves asking the patient to rise from a chair with armrests, walk 10 feet, turn, return to the chair, and sit down. A TUG Test result of more than 12 seconds should prompt intervention to reduce fall risk."

Medication is not useful in the treatment of BPPV except when the episodes are frequent and disabling. In that situation, the vestibular suppressant betahistine (not available in the United States) may be helpful along with the Epley maneuver. Meclizine probably contributed to this patient's near fall and fear of falling and is not especially helpful in controlling the symptoms of BPPV; it should be discontinued."

"). This patient has chronic venous insufficiency, which has led to venous stasis changes. The underlying cause of chronic venous insufficiency is venous hypertension, which may develop as a result of obstruction to venous flow (e.g., thrombus), dysfunction of venous valves (e.g., congenital, after injury, venous thrombosis), and failure of the âvenous pumpâ (calf muscle constriction of deep veins). The increase in venous pressure within the deep venous system is directed to the superficial venous system, causing deleterious changes in the microcirculation (such as recruitment of leukocytes, release of inflammatory mediators, and extravasation of proteins and erythrocytes into the extravascular space). Symptoms include aching, itching, restlessness, heaviness, swelling, and pain in the legs. This patient should wear compression stockings (providing 20-50 mm Hg of pressure) and be encouraged to walk or perform heel lifts to facilitate the action of the venous pump. Leg elevation should be recommended to reduce edema, but patient adherence is often difficult. Additional care recommendations include emollients to restore the skin barrier. The skin discoloration is caused by hemosiderin deposition from extravasated erythrocytes."

Naloxone is a nonselective and competitive opioid receptor blocker that reduces the risk for death from respiratory depression due to accidental opioid overdose. It is available in intranasal and injectable forms for ease of administration. Naloxone acts within minutes and has a very short half-life; its antidote effects will usually wear off before the opioid effects are gone. Patients should be observed for signs of opioid withdrawal (which is not fatal and requires only supportive care) and for continued or recurrent signs of respiratory distress (which may require repeated dosing of naloxone). According to the CDC opioid prescribing guideline, clinicians should offer naloxone to any patient at risk for opioid overdose. This includes patients with a history of overdose or substance use disorder, patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (which should be avoided whenever possible), and those taking more than 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day. In addition, naloxone should be provided to patients taking opioids who have risk factors for opioid-related harms; such patients include elderly persons, patients with mental health conditions, and patients at risk for sleep-disordered breathing (such as those with heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, or obesity), regardless of oral morphine equivalents prescribed. This patient with a history of overdose should be prescribed naloxone and educated on its proper use and ways to reverse overdose and prevent overdose death. Friends, family members, and caretakers may also receive prescriptions and training in naloxone use."

These interventions can be delivered in person in an individual or group setting, or via online or telephone-based modules. Data are insufficient to make recommendations on the optimal delivery strategy, but most analyses have been performed on in-person interventions."

Common causes of acute, transient incontinence include medications (e.g., loop diuretics, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, Î±-blockers) and urinary tract infection (UTI). Additional causes may include acute urine retention and overflow incontinence, excessively concentrated urine (a bladder irritant), stool impaction, delirium, and impaired mobility. UTI should be suspected in any individual with transient incontinence, and urinalysis should be performed to rule out infection. Although dysuria or hematuria can accompany UTI, absence of such symptoms does not exclude infection."

It comprises scheduled voiding attempts at intervals shorter than the usual time between incontinence episodes, regardless of the urge to void, with a gradual increase in the time between voids. If an episode of urgency occurs before the designated voiding time, patients are encouraged to use pelvic floor muscle contraction until the urge passes and then proceed with voiding directly afterward.

This patient has generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is characterized by excessive anxiety about activities or events (occupation, school) that a patient finds difficult to control and occurs more days than not for at least 6 months. These symptoms cause significant distress and functional impairment. Diagnosis also requires the presence of three of the following physical symptoms: restlessness, being easily fatigued, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. Clinicians must rule out physiologic effects of another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism; substance abuse; medication effect; and symptom-driven anxiety, such as anxiety secondary to dyspnea). Patients with significant anxiety or multiple unexplained physical symptoms should be screened for GAD by using the GAD-7 screening tool. This patient's GAD-7 score of 16 indicates severe anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), buspirone, and tricyclic antidepressants are all effective treatment options for GAD, and CBT is often used in combination with pharmacotherapy. SSRIs and SNRIs are preferred first-line agents because they have fewer side effects than tricyclic antidepressants and are effective in treating comorbid mood disorders when present. Paroxetine, an SSRI, is an appropriate pharmacologic choice for this patient."

This patient is receiving the maximum statin and ezetimibe doses, has controlled blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and has initiated lifestyle interventions to help decrease his risk for cardiovascular complications.

The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guideline on the management of blood cholesterol recommends considering the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor in patients aged 40 to 75 years with a baseline LDL cholesterol level of 220 mg/dL (5.70 mmol/L) or higher and who achieve an on-treatment LDL cholesterol level of 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) or higher while receiving maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy. The PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that bind to serine protease PCSK9, a liver enzyme that degrades hepatocyte LDL receptors. PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL cholesterol by 50% to 60%. According to AHA/ACC guidelines, this patient should continue statin therapy in addition to initiating PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. The 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense cholesterol guideline, in contrast to AHA/ACC guidelines, does not recommend PCSK9 inhibitor therapy for primary prevention because of inconclusive evidence of benefit and high cost."

". Clinical phenotypes of these genetic variations are assigned on the basis of enzyme activity: poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, extensive/normal metabolizer, rapid metabolizer, and ultrarapid metabolizer. The effect of the phenotype on a particular medication depends on whether the medication is an active drug or a prodrug. Levels of drugs taken in their active form are reduced in patients who are ultrarapid metabolizers and increased in patients who are poor metabolizers. Prodrugs require conversion to their active form; ultrarapid metabolizers will have increased drug levels, whereas poor metabolizers will have reduced levels. The most likely cause of this patient's altered mental status is codeine toxicity. He has evidence of opioid toxicity on physical examination, with miotic pupils and bradypnea that responded to naloxone. Codeine is a prodrug that is converted to morphine by the CYP2D6 enzyme; patients with a rapid or ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype, such as this patient, are at increased risk for toxicity. Intake of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as diltiazem, ketoconazole, or grapefruit, can also increase the risk for toxicity."

Diagnosis requires two or more episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours and fluctuating or nonfluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear pressure; the hearing loss often begins years before the vertigo. Meniere disease causes a peripheral vertigo, and nystagmus is present during episodes of vertigo. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver does not always induce vertigo or nystagmus. HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew) examination results will be consistent with a peripheral cause of vertigo: catch-up saccades, unidirectional nystagmus, and absence of vertical skew."

Bladder training comprises scheduled voiding attempts at intervals shorter than the usual time between incontinence episodes, regardless of the urge to void, with a gradual increase in the time between voids.

") is the best measure for prevention of pressure injury in this high-risk patient. The most important risk factors for pressure injury are immobility, malnutrition, sensory loss, and reduced skin perfusion, which can occur with hypovolemia, hypotension, and systemic vasoconstriction. The first step in pressure injury prevention is a comprehensive history and physical examination to assess risk. Regular, structured risk assessment should be performed to identify at-risk patients. Pressure redistribution through pressure-reducing equipment and proper patient positioning is of paramount importance in the prevention of pressure injuries in at-risk patients. Advanced static mattresses or overlays should be used in patients at increased risk. An advanced static mattress is made of specialized sheepskin, foam, or gel and is immobile when a patient lies on it, whereas an advanced static overlay is a pad composed of foam or gel that is secured to the top of a regular mattress. Harms associated with overlays include increased heat-related discomfort leading to removal of the overlay."

Unlike THC, CBD does not produce intoxication or euphoria. Medical cannabis, predominantly in forms containing higher concentrations of CBD, has shown some efficacy in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain. Systematic reviews have reported that the pharmacologically active cannabinoidsânabiximols, nabilone, dronabinol, oral cannabis extract, and THCâare associated with modest improvements in patient-reported spasticity measures. When spasticity was measured using the clinician-based Ashworth spasticity scale, there was a trend toward improvement with use of cannabinoids, but the effect was not statistically significant. Although cannabis is still classified as a schedule I agent by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, most states now allow patients to access cannabis products through state-administered medical cannabis programs or recreationally.

The diagnosis can be made by the history and physical examination findings. Degenerative meniscal tears are associated with diffuse or medial knee pain; catching, locking, or inability to extend the knee; and pain with flexion activities, such as squatting. The McMurray test for meniscal tear is performed by having the patient lay supine, flexing the knee fully, and externally rotating the tibia. The examiner's hand is over the medial joint line. The test is repeated with the tibia internally rotated. The test result is positive when snapping is detected over the joint line with extension of the knee. The Thessaly test for meniscal tear is performed by holding the patient's outstretched hands while the patient stands on the uninjured leg with the knee flexed to 5 degrees; the other knee is flexed with the foot off the floor. The patient rotates the body internally and externally on the knee three times. The test is repeated with the knee flexed to 20 degrees. This process is repeated with the injured knee. Pain in the joint line is a positive test result. A growing body of evidence supports managing degenerative meniscal tears conservatively with physical therapy and strengthening of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles."

Physical examination may reveal bony tenderness, pain with percussion, or pain with hopping on a single leg. The calcaneal squeeze test may elicit pain in patients with calcaneal fracture. Management of foot and ankle stress fractures depends on the risk for nonunion, predominantly defined by the location of the fracture. Evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon is warranted in fractures at high risk for nonunion. Such risk factors include fracture at the base of the second metatarsal, fifth metatarsal diaphysis, and medial malleolus. Calcaneal fractures pose a low risk for nonunion and can be managed with rest, crutches, a walking boot, and/or footwear padding to achieve pain-free ambulation. Follow-up radiography at 4 weeks can help document healing. Once the patient can ambulate without pain and has no pain with provocative maneuvers on examination, activity can be gradually reintroduced. Most patients with low-risk injuries can resume running by 8 to 12 weeks."

Common indications for cardiopulmonary exercise testing include assessment of undiagnosed exercise intolerance, measurement of exercise tolerance in patients with known cardiac or pulmonary disease, upcoming lung resection, and assessment of disability. Testing can lead to physiologic understanding of the cause of dyspnea (cardiovascular, ventilatory and gas exchange response, metabolic issues), narrowing the differential diagnosis, or it can support the diagnosis of deconditioning as a cause of symptoms."

Continuation of physical therapy beyond 12 weeks should be based on iterative clinical assessments and documented gains. Like physical therapy, exercise programs improve pain and function in patients with chronic pain, although no specific regimen has proved superior. Cognitive behavioral techniques, including cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness practices, and biofeedback, have been associated with reduced pain and improved overall function and mood."

"), formerly known as trochanteric bursitis. The most helpful diagnostic test for GTPS is to ask the patient to point to the location of the pain. If the patient points to the lateral hip near the greater femoral trochanter, GTPS is the most likely diagnosis. The likely cause of GTPS is friction between the greater trochanter and iliotibial band, causing repetitive microtrauma of the gluteal tendons. The characteristic finding of tenderness over the greater trochanter implies inflammation of the bursa, and more recent studies have shown involvement of the gluteus minimus and medius tendons with similar frequency. Pain that worsens with lying on the affected side suggests GTPS; the pain may also radiate to the buttock or knee if the iliotibial band is affected. The FABER (Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation) test may cause lateral hip pain with GTPS. Most cases respond to conservative measures, including activity modification, physical therapy, NSAIDs, and weight loss."
