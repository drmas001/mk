An appropriate evaluation has failed to identify the source of the patient's symptoms; the patient understands that additional testing is unlikely to be helpful. Acetaminophen, duloxetine, and NSAIDs have been minimally effective. She was recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Her only medications are ibuprofen and fluoxetine."

") plays an important role in the management of all pain subtypes, including acute and chronic nonâ€“cancer-related pain. Patients with chronic pain should be referred to a structured physical therapy program for evaluation and treatment aimed at improving functional status. High-quality evidence suggests that physical therapy programs improve both pain and function in patients with debilitation due to pain. Continuation of physical therapy beyond 12 weeks should be based on iterative clinical assessments and documented gains. Like physical therapy, exercise programs improve pain and function in patients with chronic pain, although no specific regimen has proved superior. Cognitive behavioral techniques, including cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness practices, and biofeedback, have been associated with reduced pain and improved overall function and mood."

"), gabapentin, and duloxetine are first-line pharmacologic therapies for chronic neuropathic pain. Duloxetine is also effective in some patients with musculoskeletal (somatic) pain, such as that which occurs with fibromyalgia. Other pharmacologic options for neuropathic pain include capsaicin and topical lidocaine if pain generators are focal and topically located. This patient has somatic pain, a subtype of nociceptive pain. Pregabalin is unlikely to be effective in treating this patient's pain, and nonpharmacologic management, with or without pharmacologic treatment, should always be part of chronic pain management."
