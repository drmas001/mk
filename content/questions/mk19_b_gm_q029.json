"). Nail psoriasis is characterized by dystrophic nails with yellow-red (oil stain) discoloration caused by inflammation of the nail bed; pitting caused by inflammation of the nail matrix; and distal onycholysis (separation of nail plate from the nail bed). Other findings include nail plate thickening, distal nail plate crumbling, and splinter hemorrhages. Nail psoriasis more commonly affects the fingernails than the toenails. Nail psoriasis typically occurs in patients with psoriasis, but occasionally the nail changes may precede the skin changes. A family history of psoriasis can be helpful, as can a through physical examination looking for “hidden” areas of plaque psoriasis in the gluteal cleft, periumbilically, in the concha of the ear, and on the scalp. Nail psoriasis is strongly associated with psoriatic arthritis. Patients with psoriasis, particularly involving the nails, should be screened for psoriatic arthritis at diagnosis and follow-up."
