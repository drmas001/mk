Cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening are up to date, and all results have been negative. Her 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk is 3%."

"). An individualized approach based on personal risk factors (including age; time since menopause; and absence of increased risk for cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, or breast cancer) suggests that this patient is an appropriate candidate. Estradiol can be administered orally or transdermally in gel, patch, or spray forms; progestin is needed to prevent endometrial proliferation in this patient with an intact uterus. Treatment should be initiated within 10 years of menopause and begin with the lowest effective dose needed to achieve symptom relief. Hormone therapy of more than 1 year in duration has also been associated with breast cancer in a dose-dependent manner; longer use results in greater risk. Estrogen with daily progestin results in the highest risk for breast cancer, whereas estrogen-only hormone therapy has the lowest risk. All women considering hormone therapy should receive individualized breast cancer risk assessment and counseling. Use of hormone therapy in menopause should be reassessed every year to determine benefits and risks. Treatment duration is based on continued presence of vasomotor symptoms."

Women who have an intact uterus also require progestin either dosed continuously or cyclically to avoid estrogen-related endometrial proliferation. Continuous daily estrogen with progestin does not result in cyclic vaginal bleeding, whereas estrogen with cyclic progestin will result in withdrawal bleeding."
