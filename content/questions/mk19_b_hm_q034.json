"). He has an elevated INR on routine laboratory testing but no signs or symptoms of bleeding. Bleeding risk increases as the INR increases. Additionally, patients older than 75 years, those with previous cerebrovascular accidents, and those with previous gastrointestinal bleeding are at increased risk of bleeding independent of the INR. Bleeding risk is elevated to a higher degree in patients taking concomitant aspirin, clopidogrel, or other antiplatelet agents. If a patient's INR is between 4.5 and 10, warfarin must be withheld until the INR returns to the therapeutic range; without bleeding, no other treatment is required, and observation is recommended. If the INR is greater than 10 without any bleeding, then vitamin K is recommended in addition to withholding warfarin (",

"). 4-Factor PCC has been found to be noninferior to FFP in the treatment of life-threatening bleeding. Additionally, 4-factor PCC has a faster infusion time, more rapid reversal of INR, and lower risk of volume overload. For these reasons, 4-factor PCC is the preferred agent for warfarin reversal when a reversal agent is necessary."
