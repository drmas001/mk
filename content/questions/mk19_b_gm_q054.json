") should be obtained next to assess this patient's skin findings. This patient has vitiligo, an autoimmune skin condition characterized by depigmented patches due to loss of function or absence of melanocytes. Its onset is insidious and asymptomatic, starting as smaller macules that gradually enlarge. It tends to be more visible in persons with darker skin types or in sun-exposed areas, as the surrounding skin with preserved and functional melanocytes becomes darker with sun exposure. Vitiligo can be diagnosed clinically and presents as depigmented, well-demarcated symmetric macules or patches without scale that appear most commonly on the hands, extensor surfaces, and periorificial areas. Wood lamp examination showing intense whiteness can help confirm the diagnosis. Skin biopsies are often unnecessary but will show absence of melanocytes. Treatment can be challenging and prolonged, with suboptimal results. Potent topical glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or pimecrolimus), and phototherapy are common treatments. Repigmentation often occurs first in perifollicular areas (as ",
