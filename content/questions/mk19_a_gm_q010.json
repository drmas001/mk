"A 36-year-old woman is evaluated for a 10-year history of fluctuating, migratory burning pain and paresthesia involving multiple parts of her body. Her symptoms are stable but disruptive. She has previously undergone extensive evaluation, with normal results. She has tried nortriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, and topical lidocaine without benefit. Medical history is significant for migraine, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and irritable bowel syndrome. Results of recent screening for depression and generalized anxiety disorder were negative. Current medications are duloxetine, propranolol, and sumatriptan."

"). MUS are symptoms that cannot be attributed to a specific medical cause after a thorough medical evaluation. Common symptoms in patients with MUS include fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain (back pain, myalgia, arthralgia), dizziness, paresthesia, generalized weakness, transient edema, insomnia, dyspnea, chest pain, chronic facial pain, chronic pelvic pain, and chemical sensitivities. The management of MUS focuses on restoring function, decreasing symptom focus, and acquiring coping mechanisms rather than abating symptoms. It should be made clear to patients that treatment of MUS will probably not be curative and that symptoms may persist. A therapeutic alliance and a mutually respectful physician-patient relationship are key features in the successful management of the patient with MUS. In keeping with a patient-centered approach, the patient should be engaged fully in the plan, focusing on physical, psychological, and social aspects of health. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, individual or group psychotherapy, social support, biofeedback therapy, graded exercise therapy, stress management activities, and training in coping mechanisms, are the cornerstone of treatment."

"Rather than pursuing further costly, low-value diagnostic evaluations, it may be more beneficial and value-driven to assess and treat any potential underlying psychological symptoms and to educate patients with MUS on successful coping skills based on the personal impact of their symptoms. As such, ordering more advanced imaging, such as MRI of the spine (",
