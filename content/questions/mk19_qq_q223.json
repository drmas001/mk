"), which is characterized by symptoms of biliary colic, including right-upper-quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Pain is typically constant but may be intermittent and typically lasts longer than 6 hours. This patient's liver chemistry test results (disproportionate increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin compared to aminotransferase levels) support a diagnosis of bile duct obstruction. Visualization of gallstones and dilation of the common bile duct on ultrasonography support the diagnosis. The absence of fever and leukocytosis or hyperamylasemia makes a complication such as cholangitis or pancreatitis less likely. Importantly, less than 50% of patients with choledocholithiasis develop symptoms, and 20% spontaneously pass stones from the common bile duct."

") is one of the potential complications of choledocholithiasis. Cholangitis presents as a syndrome of fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain (Charcot triad) that develops as a result of stasis and infection in the biliary tract with organisms that typically ascend from the small intestine. Occasionally, sepsis arises in severe cases, leading to hypotension and altered mental status (Reynold pentad)."

") may present with similar symptoms of biliary colic, physical examination and imaging findings can be used to differentiate between the diagnoses. In cholecystitis, patients usually have fever and a positive Murphy sign (arrest of respiration on palpation of the RUQ). Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis, normal or very mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, and normal or mild hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin level <4 mg/dL [68.4 Âµmol/L]). Diagnosis can be made by using ultrasonography to visualize gallbladder wall thickening and/or edema and a sonographic Murphy sign. This patient's ultrasound does not show any of these findings."

") is suggested by typical biliary pain in the absence of gallstones or structural pathology. Typical biliary pain is located in the epigastrium and/or RUQ; is intermittent; lasts at least 30 minutes; crescendos and then plateaus; is severe enough to interrupt normal activities or results in an emergency department visit; and is not relieved by bowel movements, positional changes, or acid suppression. This patient's abnormal imaging and laboratory evaluation exclude functional gallbladder disorder."
