"). This patient meets the criteria for metabolic syndrome because of his large waist circumference, fasting glucose level, and triglyceride level. Metabolic syndrome is a marker of risk for future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The recommended initial intervention is intensive lifestyle modifications to decrease risk. Guidelines from the Endocrine Society on primary prevention of ASCVD and type 2 diabetes recommended prescribing a cardiovascular-healthy diet. Diets that have been most associated with decreased cardiovascular risk focus on consumption of fruits, vegetables, fiber, and monounsaturated fats and minimize intake of saturated and ",

" fats, simple carbohydrates, and red meats. Examples include the Mediterranean diet (associated with an 18%-40% reduction in diabetes) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (associated with decreased blood pressure and LDL cholesterol level). In patients with elevated BMI, such as this patient, moderate weight loss (â‰¥5%) is recommended to decrease the incidence of diabetes by 30% to 60%. Weight loss will also lower blood pressure and lipid levels. In addition, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommend an active lifestyle involving at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week."

According to the AHA/ACC guideline on management of blood cholesterol, moderate-intensity statin therapy could be considered in patients with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to less than 7.5% in the presence of ASCVD risk enhancers, including metabolic syndrome. Other risk enhancers include family history of premature ASCVD; chronic kidney disease; presence of inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, HIV infection, psoriasis); and South Asian ethnicity. The USPSTF recommends selective consideration of low- to moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients without ASCVD who have at least one ASCVD risk factor (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year ASCVD event risk of 7.5% to 10%."
