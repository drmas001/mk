") should be obtained. CES is an uncommon but potentially catastrophic condition caused by compression and ischemia of some or all of the 18 descending nerve roots that make up the cauda equina, with resulting neurologic impairment. Causes may be benign (such as degenerative changes, disk herniation, spondylosis, and other structural abnormalities of the spine; infection; or bleeding) or malignant (with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and prostate cancer being the most commonly associated cancers). Classic clinical findings include acute low back pain, radicular pain, and bilateral leg weakness. CES may be associated with perineal sensory symptoms; bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction; and decreased or absent distal reflexes. However, not all of these features present early in the syndrome. For example, pain is the most common early symptom and may precede other neurologic findings; bowel and bladder dysfunction are usually late manifestations and do not occur in all patients. Urgent neuroimaging with MRI and surgical treatment offer the best chance of avoiding permanent neurologic damage."

Lumbar puncture will be required to introduce contrast if CT myelography is performed, and neurosurgical input is often recommended."
