"). She is younger than 25 years and at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because she has multiple partners and inconsistently uses condoms. Other risk factors include a new sex partner in the previous 60 days; having sex with a partner recently treated for an STI; sex for money or drugs; sex with sex workers; and sex with anonymous partners. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for syphilis in all pregnant women and in nonpregnant adults and adolescents at high risk for STIs. Half of STIs diagnosed are in the 15- to 24-year age range, underscoring the importance of screening in this age group. Her age and high-risk STI status necessitate screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea; HIV testing would also be recommended (",
