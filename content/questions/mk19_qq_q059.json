"). The American College of Emergency Physicians and the CDC have published guidelines for management of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Their recommendation is to consider a noncontrast head CT in patients with TBI who have had no (or very brief) loss of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia but have a focal neurologic deficit, vomiting, severe headache, physical signs of a basilar skull fracture, Glasgow Coma Scale score lower than 15, coagulopathy, or a dangerous mechanism of injury, such as ejection from a motor vehicle or a fall from a height of more than 3 feet. These findings have nearly 100% sensitivity for identifying patients with clinically important findings but low specificity. This patient sustained a TBI with a dangerous mechanism of injury several hours ago and has developed symptoms (worsening headache and vomiting) mentioned in the guideline. Therefore, noncontrast CT of the head is indicated. A finding of parenchymal, subdural, or epidural hemorrhage requires emergent neurosurgical evaluation."

") because of its lower cost and wider availability. Contrast administration aids in the assessment of certain malignant and vascular lesions of the brain but adds nothing to the evaluation of acute head trauma. Head CT without contrast is also very sensitive for detecting skull fracture or acute hemorrhage, and a CT scan generally requires shorter examination times than a brain MRI requires, both important factors in the evaluation of a patient with acute head injury and symptoms of potential deterioration."

"), are being studied as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of mild TBI. Tau protein levels have been found to be significantly elevated over baseline when measured 1 hour after concussion and remain elevated for as long as symptoms persist. Measurement of tau protein and other biomarkers are not ready for clinical practice, and importantly, will not replace neuroimaging as the gold standard test to detect intracerebral bleeding."
