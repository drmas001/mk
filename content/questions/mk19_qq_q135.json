"), while blood and urine cultures are pending. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an absolute neutrophil count <500/µL, and expected prolonged neutropenia (>7 days) are at high risk for neutropenic fevers. This is a medical emergency, and immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage within 60 minutes of presentation is recommended. Multiple clinical factors should influence the initial empiric therapy, such as localizing symptoms, prior infections, local antibiotic resistance pattern, previous prophylactic antibiotic coverage, and others. Monotherapy with a β-lactam agent with broad coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and antipseudomonal activity is effective in treating neutropenic fever and is the most commonly used approach. Although combination antibiotic therapy is often used (e.g., adding an aminoglycoside for additional antipseudomonal coverage), no specific regimen is superior to broad-spectrum monotherapy. Antifungal agents are usually considered only for patients with mucosal barrier inflammation and prolonged neutropenia (>1 week)."
