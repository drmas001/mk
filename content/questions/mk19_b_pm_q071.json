"). The patient is presenting with septic shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her presentation is secondary to a multifocal pneumonia with an associated left pleural effusion. Once a pleural effusion is detected on chest radiograph, bedside thoracic ultrasonography can be used to characterize the fluid and the feasibility of drainage. Thoracic point-of-care ultrasonography is a helpful addition particularly in patients who are semirecumbent, such as those who are critically ill, and does not necessitate transporting the patient from the ICU or interrupting resuscitation. Thoracic ultrasonography allows for the easy identification of a free-flowing or loculated pleural effusion and can differentiate between solid masses and loculated effusions. The presence of a loculated pleural effusion in the setting of severe community-acquired pneumonia would be an indication for diagnostic sampling and drainage of the effusion."
