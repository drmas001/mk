") should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions in Western societies and has become one of the leading indications for liver transplantation in the United States. Elevated liver enzyme levels support the diagnosis, but normal values do not rule it out. Depending on the patient's demographics and social history, investigations for viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis may be conducted. Abdominal ultrasonography is inexpensive and widely available, and it has a sensitivity of approximately 80% for detecting steatosis when hepatocytes contain more than 20% of histologically detected fat. Because complications of NAFLD include liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, patients with NAFLD should have screening ultrasonography every 3 years. If fibrosis/cirrhosis is present, ultrasonographic screening should take place every 6 months. No specific treatment for NAFLD is available; therefore, weight reduction and moderation/cessation of alcohol use are strongly recommended. After the initial diagnosis of NAFLD, further evaluation for advanced fibrosis may be needed, particularly in patients with metabolic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia."
