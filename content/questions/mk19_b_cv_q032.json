") is the most appropriate additional treatment for this patient with typical atrial flutter. Atrial flutter is an organized macro-reentrant tachycardia with discrete regular atrial activity on ECG, usually with an atrial rate of 250/min to 300/min. This patient has an atrial rate of 300/min with 2:1 block, resulting in a ventricular rate of 150/min. Typical atrial flutter is characterized electrocardiographically by a sawtooth pattern with inverted flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF and positive flutter waves in lead V",

". Tachycardia-induced heart failure (HF) may be the initial presentation of poorly controlled atrial flutter among patients who are otherwise asymptomatic, and unrecognized, prolonged tachycardia may lead to HF. This form of cardiomyopathy is often reversible with control of heart rate and/or rhythm. In typical atrial flutter, catheter ablation may be curative for most patients and is appropriate first-line therapy for this patient. Acute cardioversion was a reasonable choice for this patient to achieve acute improvement in clinical status. However, it is extremely likely that atrial flutter will recur, which makes this patient at very high risk for recurrent HF and underscores the need for definitive treatment."
