"). Rotator cuff disease is the most common cause of shoulder pain and refers to all symptomatic rotator cuff disorders, including subacromial bursitis, tendinopathy, and rotator cuff tear. Risk factors for rotator cuff disease include increasing age and participation in activities that require repetitive overhead arm use. This patient has worsened pain with overhead activities, pain with active abduction, and a positive painful arc test (complete passive abduction of arm with pain between 60 and 120 degrees) and empty can test. The empty can test is a maneuver where the extended arm is passively abducted to 90° in the plane of the supraspinatus (30° anterior to the coronal plane) and internally rotated (as though pouring a glass of water onto the floor). The patient is asked to maintain the position while the examiner exerts downward force on the arm. Weakness or reproduction of pain is a positive result. These findings are consistent with rotator cuff tendinopathy involving the supraspinatus tendon, which is the most commonly involved tendon in nontraumatic rotator cuff injury. Given the patient's classic presentation and examination findings, it is appropriate to diagnose him without further testing. Initial therapy typically includes rest, avoidance of aggravating activities, NSAIDs, and physical therapy to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles and improve flexibility."
