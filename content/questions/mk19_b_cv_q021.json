"). In a randomized trial, the addition of very low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) to aspirin (81 mg daily) was shown to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The absolute risk reduction, when compared with aspirin alone, was 2% in 7470 patients enrolled with either lower extremity PAD or carotid stenosis. Major bleeding, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding, was increased by 1% in patients assigned to aspirin plus rivaroxaban. Thus, low-dose rivaroxaban should be avoided in patients with PAD who have a higher risk for bleeding. It should be noted that use of rivaroxaban in patients with PAD is at odds with the 2016 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) PAD guideline, which recommends against anticoagulation to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events in patients with PAD due to lack of benefit and increased risk for harm from major bleeding events, including intracranial bleeding. The studies that informed the AHA/ACC recommendation used warfarin as the anticoagulant."
