Tympanic membranes appear normal. Placement of a 256-Hz vibrating tuning fork midline on the forehead results in a louder sound in the right ear. For each ear, the tuning fork sound is louder when placed in front of the external ear canal compared with placement on the mastoid process."

"). Hearing loss is categorized according to the anatomic deficit: conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Conductive hearing loss is more often associated with pain or ear drainage, whereas sensorineural hearing loss is more often accompanied by tinnitus or vertigo. In patients with hearing loss, physical examination should include otoscopic examination as well as the Weber and Rinne tests. The Weber test assesses sensorineural hearing. In the Weber test, a 256-Hz vibrating tuning fork is applied to the midline forehead, bridge of the nose, or teeth. A normal result is no lateralization of loudness of the sound (sound loudness equal in both ears). In the presence of sensorineural hearing loss, the sound lateralizes (is louder) in the uninvolved ear. In this patient, the sound was louder in the right ear; thus, the left ear is impaired. The Rinne test assesses conductive hearing. In this test, the patient is asked to identify whether the tuning fork sound is louder when placed on the mastoid process (bone conduction) or when placed in front of the external auditory canal (air conduction). A normal test is associated with air conduction louder than bone conduction. This patient, with a Weber test that lateralizes to the right ear (the “good ear”) and normal conduction in the left ear (air conduction greater than bone conduction) has sensorineural hearing loss of the left ear. The most concerning condition causing chronic unilateral sensorineural hearing loss with tinnitus is an acoustic neuroma. The first diagnostic step is confirmation of the hearing loss with audiometry followed by MRI of the internal auditory meatus."
