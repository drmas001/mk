"). This patient sustained thermal injury to his upper airway as evidenced by symptoms of tracheal irritation, sore throat, dysphonia, and an edematous oropharynx. Intense heat can cause edema and blistering from the mouth to the larynx, and patients with a visibly damaged airway or stridor are at high risk of complete upper airway obstruction due to swelling. It is difficult to predict which patients with acute inhalational injury will develop complete upper airway obstruction, and even patients with minimally apparent inhalational airway injury may develop worsening obstruction associated with intravenous hydration or analgesia needed for burn treatment. Following smoke inhalation, one third of patients develop airway edema or mucosal sloughing from epithelial necrosis. Chest physiotherapy and serial bronchoscopy are frequently necessary to facilitate continued airway clearance. Other presenting symptoms and signs of inhalation injury include stridor, dysphagia, singed nasal hairs, and sooty sputum, which signal the need for inspection of the upper airway. Immediate protection of the airway is indicated for patients with extensive facial or neck burns, decreased level of consciousness, or airway obstruction. If there is any doubt about the airway patency, intubation is always preferred."
