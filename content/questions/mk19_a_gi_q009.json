"). This patient is at high risk for celiac disease, given her chronic diarrhea, low weight, osteoporosis, and family history. Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody is the preferred serologic test for celiac disease in general, but its sensitivity is diminished in the setting of selective IgA deficiency. This patient's undetectable total IgA level indicates that she has selective IgA deficiency, so IgG serology should be used. Available IgG serologies are antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptide or tissue transglutaminase. If the anti–deamidated gliadin peptide IgG antibody level is elevated, upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy should be performed; the presence of villus atrophy indicates a diagnosis of celiac disease, for which a gluten-free diet should be prescribed."
