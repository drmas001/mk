"). This patient has adult femaleâ€“type acne, characterized by papules and nodules on the lower half of the face with marked presence on the jawline. Adult acne is more common in women and, when present, results from an abnormal response to physiologic levels of androgens. It typically presents along the jawline and often flares with the menstrual cycle. Although considered second-line therapy, oral contraceptives or spironolactone (aldosterone receptor blocker with antiandrogen activity) can be added to other treatments in women with moderate to severe acne. Spironolactone is an excellent choice for adult female acne for which topical therapies have failed. Spironolactone is a pregnancy category C (risk cannot be ruled out), and contraception is recommended when used in premenopausal women for the treatment of conditions such as hirsutism and acne."
