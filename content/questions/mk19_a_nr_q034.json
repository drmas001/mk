"A 26-year-old man is evaluated for a 5-month history of jerking episodes that occur three to four times monthly. The jerking lasts less than 1 second. He is aware during the episodes and retains a complete memory of the event. He reports that sometimes the jerking occurs in clusters and he will have 10 to 20 jerks over a period of 30 to 90 seconds, often on awakening from sleep. He denies confusion or loss of muscle tone with either the single or clustered events. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications."

"), which typically have very short duration (<1 second) with retained awareness. Characteristic clinical findings of myoclonus are brief, “shock-like” involuntary movements caused by muscular contractions (positive myoclonus) or inhibitions (negative myoclonus, [e.g., asterixis]). Positive myoclonus is the defining seizure manifestation of myoclonic seizures. When describing symptoms, patients will usually use words like “twitches”, “spasms,” “jerks,” or even “shakes.” Patients are often described as “clumsy” before establishing the diagnosis of myoclonic seizure, since suddenly dropping items is a common symptom. Myoclonic seizures are considered generalized seizures, which involve the entire body. They may occur more often on awakening, and recording an electroencephalogram (EEG) after a period of sleep may help capture evidence of the seizure for diagnostic confirmation. Myoclonus should not be confused with myoclonic seizures; myoclonus is a single muscle group twitch that may be focal or generalized, but which may or may not represent a seizure. For example, benign myoclonus of sleep, the so-called hypnic jerks commonly experienced when falling asleep, are normal; unlike with a myoclonic seizure, the EEG pattern would be normal during the myoclonic event."

"), previously known as complex partial seizures, typically originate in the frontal lobe, where the motor cortex controls contralateral limb movement. By definition, the shaking of these seizures is rhythmic, repetitive, and unilateral. Similar to JME, patients with focal motor seizures are alert and responsive."

Tonic seizures are typically painful if awareness is retained, although awareness is typically altered and leads to falling. Tonic seizures typically occur in patients with neurologic developmental disabilities and epilepsies with multiple seizure types; this patient is an otherwise neurologically healthy adult with brief episodes of myoclonus without impairment of consciousness."
