"A 74-year-old woman is evaluated before hospital discharge. She was hospitalized 3 days ago for surgical repair of a left hip fracture after a fall. She has been evaluated by physical and occupational therapists and is thought to be unsafe for discharge home, where she lives alone, because of her inability to safely stand with a walker and ambulate in the hospital room. Her tolerance for physical therapy is estimated to be less than 3 hours per day. Medical history is significant for hypertension and prior stroke with residual right-sided weakness. She required a cane to ambulate before the fall. Medications are aspirin, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and acetaminophen as needed for pain."

In this setting, she can gradually improve her functional status over a period of up to 100 days, such that she can be discharged to independent living. Her current functional status, coupled with a medical history of preexisting functional impairment due to stroke, suggests that she requires a rehabilitation environment that allows for a slow recovery pace."
