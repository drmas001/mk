It typically presents as perifollicular erythematous papules and pustules over the face, scalp, trunk, and thigh; however, it can appear over any hair-bearing area of skin. The diagnosis of folliculitis can be made from history and clinical presentation. Bacterial cultures can be performed from pustules but are usually unnecessary. Skin biopsies can be performed when causes other than bacterial infection, such as fungal or herpetic infections, are suspected. This patient most likely has ",
