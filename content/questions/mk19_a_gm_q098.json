") is the best measure for prevention of pressure injury in this high-risk patient. The most important risk factors for pressure injury are immobility, malnutrition, sensory loss, and reduced skin perfusion, which can occur with hypovolemia, hypotension, and systemic vasoconstriction. The first step in pressure injury prevention is a comprehensive history and physical examination to assess risk. Regular, structured risk assessment should be performed to identify at-risk patients. Pressure redistribution through pressure-reducing equipment and proper patient positioning is of paramount importance in the prevention of pressure injuries in at-risk patients. Advanced static mattresses or overlays should be used in patients at increased risk. An advanced static mattress is made of specialized sheepskin, foam, or gel and is immobile when a patient lies on it, whereas an advanced static overlay is a pad composed of foam or gel that is secured to the top of a regular mattress. Harms associated with overlays include increased heat-related discomfort leading to removal of the overlay."
