"The most likely diagnosis is transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). TRALI is defined as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs within 6 hours of transfusion. These patients are more likely to present with fever and hypotension and less likely to have overt signs of volume overload as in patients with transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Radiographic findings usually suggest a noncardiac pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome but may resemble those seen in TACO."
