"). The first stage of Lyme disease usually presents with a flu-like illness 1 to 4 weeks after infection, characterized by an erythema migrans rash. Focal cardiac or neurologic symptoms may also occur in early disseminated disease, typically 2 to 10 weeks following the development of the rash. Although Lyme meningitis can involve any cranial nerve, facial nerve palsy is the most common manifestation, occurring in 8% of patients with Lyme disease. Lyme disease causes a lymphocytic meningitis that may be indistinguishable from viral meningitis, with fever, headache, and meningismus. The “rule of 7s” can help classify a patient at low risk of having Lyme disease (headache duration <7 days, <70% mononuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], and absence of a seventh facial nerve palsy). Lyme meningitis usually occurs in the summer and fall in endemic areas (e.g., northeastern United States), and it is often associated with peripheral facial palsy. The patient works outdoors in an endemic state (Pennsylvania), and tick bite exposure is likely."

West Nile virus can present as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. A maculopapular rash may be seen, and patients usually report mosquito bites in the preceding weeks. In patients with encephalitis, basal ganglia involvement (tremor, rigidity, postural instability, bradykinesia) is a clue. Isolated facial palsy in West Nile meningitis is rare."
