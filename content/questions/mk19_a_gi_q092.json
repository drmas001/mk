"). This patient with a history of celiac disease has a chronic pruritic vesicular rash on the elbows and knees. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a neutrophilic dermatosis caused by IgA antibodies against tissue and epidermal transglutaminase. It typically presents with intensely pruritic papules and fragile vesicles that rapidly break, leaving tiny erosions. A skin biopsy specimen will show numerous neutrophils stuffing the dermal papillae, and a granular pattern of IgA deposition will be seen on direct immunofluorescence. Most patients with dermatitis herpetiformis will have an underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy. However, they are usually free of gastrointestinal symptoms; only 20% of patients with celiac disease will develop dermatitis herpetiformis. The distribution and morphology, in the context of a history of celiac disease, are compatible with dermatitis herpetiformis. This condition is treated with a gluten-free diet, but patients may have continued symptoms despite strict adherence to this diet. Such patients may respond to dapsone (",

"). Before initiation of dapsone therapy, it is necessary to check for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because individuals with this condition can develop hemolytic anemia when exposed to this medication. Methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis, and a dapsone hypersensitivity reaction are additional adverse effects. If the patient exhibits normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, dapsone can be initiated."

When topical glucocorticoids are used, they should be administered along with dapsone and a gluten-free diet. Systemic glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, are usually ineffective in the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis."

Therefore, treatment with hydroxychloroquine is not indicated in this patient."
