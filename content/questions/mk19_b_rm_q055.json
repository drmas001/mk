"). This patient has polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) characterized by symmetric proximal myalgia and stiffness, accompanied by constitutional symptoms and an elevated C-reactive protein level. Symptoms are most pronounced in the morning and improve after several hours. Although some patients also have peripheral arthritis (usually of the knees and wrists), most do not. Physical findings are usually limited to difficulty moving the affected areas (shoulders and hips). There is no diagnostic test specific for PMR. With a reasonable degree of suspicion for PMR, an empiric glucocorticoid trial is appropriate. Initiating prednisone at 12.5 to 20 mg/d is appropriate for this generally self-limited illness. Symptoms usually improve dramatically within 48 hours (diagnostically helpful), and tapering may begin after 2 weeks."

Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a chronic inflammatory polyarthritis affecting large and small joints, with a predilection for the small joints of the hands and feet. SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease affecting mainly women (90%), and skin rash and joint symptoms affect 90% of patients. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis affects the upper and lower airways, kidneys, eyes, and ears."

"Although the patient's primary concern is “pain everywhere,” further questioning reveals that the patient has pain in distinct areas. It is crucial to pinpoint areas of discomfort via history because different disease processes result in distinct patterns of pain. Patients with chronic widespread pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, may indeed have diffuse pain. However, patients with other, more localized issues often report “pain everywhere,” and in the absence of a good history, premature closure may lead to an incorrect diagnosis. In this case, diagnosing fibromyalgia and prescribing pregabalin (",
