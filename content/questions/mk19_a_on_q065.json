"). Removal of the tumor intact is associated with improved survival. The patient should undergo comprehensive surgical staging to evaluate for additional disease that would upstage the patient. This procedure is usually performed through a laparotomy and involves inspection of the peritoneal cavity including the paracolic gutters, dome of the diaphragm, lymph node sampling, omentectomy, and peritoneal washings. Gynecologic oncologists are more likely to optimally cytoreduce patients with ovarian cancer than those without specific training in gynecologic oncology."

A CT-guided biopsy is an appropriate diagnostic procedure for a patient who presents with advanced ovarian cancer in which there is radiographic evidence of spread in the peritoneum or to a distant site, and which is not amenable to surgical resection. In this case, the patient may undergo an initial biopsy followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy to facilitate optimal debulking surgery."
