"). Coronary vasospasm occurs either spontaneously from vasomotor dysfunction or after exposure to drugs (such as cocaine or chemotherapeutic agents) and is often a diagnosis of exclusion. Invasive testing with coronary angiography may not reveal spontaneous vasoconstriction, and additional provocative testing with acetylcholine or ergonovine infusion may be necessary to confirm an abnormal vasoconstrictive response. With the use of provocative testing, coronary vasospasm has been identified in as many as 46% of patients with myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. ECG patterns may be nonspecific or suggest ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Severe cases of multivessel spasm may be associated with widespread ST-segment elevation and possibly ventricular dysrhythmia and cardiac arrest. Treatment with calcium channel blockade and/or nitrates can rapidly reverse coronary vasoconstriction, with improvement in myocardial perfusion, symptoms, ECG abnormalities, and hemodynamics."
