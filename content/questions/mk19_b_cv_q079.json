"). The 2021 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes from the American Diabetes Association, endorsed by the American College of Cardiology, recommends either a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, as part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction and/or the glucose-lowering regimen. In this population, both drugs are associated with reduced rates of adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. In this patient with obesity, the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide may be preferred to an SGLT2 inhibitor because it is associated with weight loss. Furthermore, the hypoglycemic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is diminished if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m",

"), should be considered for patients with prior coronary intervention, high ischemic risk, and low bleeding risk to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events. However, this patient is already taking rivaroxaban and aspirin. Combination therapy with aspirin plus low-dose rivaroxaban should be considered in patients with stable coronary and/or peripheral artery disease and low bleeding risk to prevent major adverse limb and cardiovascular events. The addition of clopidogrel to this regimen (triple antithrombotic therapy) is generally avoided because of the increased risk for bleeding."
