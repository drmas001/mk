Often described as creaking, grating, or scratching, pericardial friction rubs are heard best at the left sternal border with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and holding the breath in expiration. As in this example, pericardial rubs may vary in intensity with respiration."

The murmur of aortic stenosis is a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur loudest at the upper right sternal edge. A continuous murmur of patent ductus arteriosus begins in systole and extends without interruption into diastole."
