") is the best management for this patient. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is diagnosed and treated the same in older adults as it is in nonelderly persons. However, UTI may be difficult to diagnose in older patients, who often have chronic lower urinary tract symptoms, such as difficulty voiding (men) or incontinence (women). Eliciting information on specific symptoms of UTI (dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, flank pain, hematuria) may be difficult in older patients with dementia, delirium, or preexisting chronic urinary symptoms. Because the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age, it may be inappropriately attributed as the cause of various nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, malaise, fever, confusion, delirium). Finding bacteriuria in older patients with nonspecific symptoms may lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, with consequences such as antibiotic resistance and antibiotic-related side effects, which may be severe. Urine testing should be limited to patients with specific symptoms of UTI, such as new or worsening urgency, frequency, incontinence, suprapubic or costovertebral tenderness, or hematuria, or findings of a new, serious illness consistent with sepsis. In the absence of specific signs of UTI, another source for the patient's symptoms should be sought."

"In an older patient with specific symptoms of UTI and abnormal urinalysis findings, it would be appropriate to offer antibiotic treatment. First-line therapy is the same as in nonelderly patients and includes nitrofurantoin (5 days), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (3 days), or fosfomycin (1 dose).
