"). Inpatient hyperglycemia, defined as consistently elevated glucose values greater than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), is associated with poor outcomes, but attempts to achieve blood glucose targets less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is associated with hypoglycemia. The American Diabetes Association recommends that insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold of 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). After insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8-10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for most critically ill and non-critically ill patients. This recommendation is based on the findings from the NICE-SUGAR randomized clinical trial and is supported by several meta-analyses, some of which suggest that tight glycemic control (80-110 mg/dL [4.4-6.1 mmol/L]) increases mortality compared with more moderate glycemic targets and generally causes higher rates of hypoglycemia. Intravenous insulin therapy is recommended for critically ill inpatients with a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Subcutaneous insulin is appropriate for non-critically ill inpatients."
