"), an autoimmune bullous disease (ABD). ABDs are caused by antibodies interfering with cohesion between keratinocytes of the epidermis (desmosomes) or between the epidermis and dermis (basement membrane zone). ABDs can be subdivided into intraepidermal and subepidermal disorders. Intraepidermal ABDs present with flaccid vesicles that rupture easily, whereas subepidermal ABDs show intact, tense bullae. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common intraepidermal ABD, and its incidence increases with age. It presents with flaccid oral or other mucosal bullae that rupture easily and leave erosions. Lesions heal with pigment change but otherwise do not scar. This patient has an acute onset of a blistering disorder. Pemphigus vulgaris always involves the oral mucosa and may affect the skin in varying degrees."

Patients with SJS and TEN present with significant skin pain (even in unaffected areas), malaise, and fever and typically appear toxic. Furthermore, patients with SJS and TEN present with two mucosal surfaces involved, whereas this patient has only one involved mucosal surface: the mouth. SJS or TEN occurs secondary to medication or infection, typically within 2 weeks of administration, usually shorter. Although this patient has a history of doxycycline use, it was started 6 months ago, not within the 2-week window typical for SJS and TEN."
