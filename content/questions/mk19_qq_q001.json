") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient with likely actinic keratoses. The usual presentation of actinic keratosis is a poorly defined, erythematous, scaly “sandpaper” macule that typically occurs on sun-exposed areas (e.g., face, dorsal arms, hands, legs, and upper back) of older persons with fair skin. Approximately 1% to 5% of actinic keratoses will develop into squamous cell cancers. This patient has extensive involvement, with a large number of lesions. Extensive actinic keratoses require “field therapy” to adequately treat the extensive precancerous lesions. When there are more than 10 (to 15) lesions, targeted specific lesion destruction is often inadequate, so it is preferable to treat the entire affected area. This can be achieved with topical chemotherapy creams, such as fluorouracil, imiquimod, or ingenol mebutate; however, a randomized clinical trial demonstrated that fluorouracil is the most effective treatment. Topical fluorouracil is applied once or twice daily and causes erythema, blistering, and necrosis with erosion, followed by re-epithelialization. The process may take from 4 to 6 weeks. The prevention of additional actinic keratoses with sun avoidance and sun protection is an important therapeutic principle. Use of fluorouracil cream can reduce the number of new actinic keratoses that develop over the subsequent 6 to 24 months and reduce rates of new lesion growth, need for targeted lesion-specific treatment, and number of lesions overall."
