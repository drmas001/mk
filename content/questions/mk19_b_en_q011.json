") related to recent pituitary surgery. SIADH can occur 4 to 12 days after pituitary surgery with a peak incidence of 7 to 8 days. It is thought to be caused by excess release of antidiuretic hormone related to manipulation of the posterior pituitary gland during pituitary surgery. This syndrome can also be part of a triphasic response in which patients first develop diabetes insipidus postoperatively, followed by SIADH, and then permanent diabetes insipidus. It is important to recognize SIADH early so measures can be taken to avoid severe hyponatremia. Treatment usually centers on fluid restriction, although vasopressin receptor antagonists or hypertonic saline may be required in severe hyponatremia. Patients with symptoms of hyponatremia and sodium levels less than 130 mEq/L (130 mmol/L) benefit from hospital admission."
