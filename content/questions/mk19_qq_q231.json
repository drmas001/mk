"). The evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) should include medical, psychosocial, and sexual components as well as noting the presence of early-morning and nocturnal spontaneous erections, which suggest a psychological cause. Physical examination should include cardiovascular, genital, digital rectal, peripheral vascular, and neurologic evaluations. Clinicians should pay close attention to reduced testicular volume, loss of normal body hair distribution, and gynecomastia, which suggest hypogonadism. Basic laboratory evaluation includes fasting glucose, lipid, morning testosterone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Given this patient's activity level and absence of cardiovascular risks, no further assessment for safe sexual activity is necessary. Appropriate lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss if needed, should be discussed first. Referral to behavioral health also should be considered for underlying mood disorder and psychosocial/interpersonal aspects of ED. First-line drug therapy is a PDE-5 inhibitor, such as tadalafil. PDE-5 inhibitors increase penile cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which facilitates smooth muscle relaxation and allows inflow of blood. An adequate trial is generally deemed to include gradual escalation of the dose to the maximum, with at least six attempts of maximum-dose therapy. PDE-5 inhibitors should be avoided in patients receiving any form of nitrate therapy. There is a risk for hearing loss with their use, and a rare complication is nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy characterized by acute, monocular, painless visual loss with optic disc swelling. Concomitant use of Î±-blockers may result in hypotension."
