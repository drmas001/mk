"). Patients with immune-mediated type 1 diabetes are at an increased risk for other autoimmune disorders, including celiac disease, thyroid disorders, vitiligo, pernicious anemia (autoimmune gastritis with intrinsic factor deficiency), autoimmune hepatitis, and autoimmune primary adrenal gland failure. Positive antibody tests should be followed by confirmatory duodenal biopsy. Consideration should be given to assessing total IgA level, and, if IgA deficiency is present, anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG antibodies or tissue transglutaminase IgG antibodies can be used. In the case of negative serologic tests with high level of suspicion, endoscopy with duodenal biopsy may be indicated. Classic celiac disease is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease involving the small intestine in response to sensitivity to dietary gluten. Celiac disease most commonly presents with diarrhea and evidence of malabsorption. A common skin manifestation is dermatitis herpetiformis, characterized by pruritic inflammatory papules and vesicles on the forearms, knees, lower back, sacrum, and buttocks. The vesicles rapidly break, leaving erosions."
