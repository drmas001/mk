"). The metatarsals, tarsals, and calcaneus are the most common sites of stress fracture in the foot. Physical examination may reveal bony tenderness, pain with percussion, or pain with hopping on a single leg. The calcaneal squeeze test may elicit pain in patients with calcaneal fracture. Management of foot and ankle stress fractures depends on the risk for nonunion, predominantly defined by the location of the fracture. Evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon is warranted in fractures at high risk for nonunion. Such risk factors include fracture at the base of the second metatarsal, fifth metatarsal diaphysis, and medial malleolus. Calcaneal fractures pose a low risk for nonunion and can be managed with rest, crutches, a walking boot, and/or footwear padding to achieve pain-free ambulation. Follow-up radiography at 4 weeks can help document healing. Once the patient can ambulate without pain and has no pain with provocative maneuvers on examination, activity can be gradually reintroduced. Most patients with low-risk injuries can resume running by 8 to 12 weeks."
