"). Delirium is characterized by an acute change in cognitive functioning occurring over hours to days, with fluctuations during the course of the day. Features of delirium include inattention, disorganized thinking, executive dysfunction, altered level of consciousness (lethargy or hypervigilance), perceptual disturbances (hallucinations or delusions), altered psychomotor activity (hyperactivity, hypoactivity, or alternating periods of hyperactivity and hypoactivity), sleep-wake disturbances, and labile mood. It is extremely common in patients in the ICU and is associated with increased length of ICU stay, morbidity, mortality, and cognitive impairment. Risk factors for delirium include preexisting dementia, hypertension, alcoholism, and high severity of illness on ICU admission. Patients should be monitored regularly and assessed using scales such as the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Measures to decrease the risk of delirium include early mobilization, preservation of nocturnal sleep, adequate pain management, orientation of the patient, provision of visual and hearing aids, and minimization of nonessential medications. Early mobilization, consisting of interruption of sedation followed by physical and occupational therapy in the earliest days of critical illness, can be effective for treating and preventing delirium."

Additional measures that may help mild OSA include reducing alcohol intake before bedtime, avoiding sedating medications (benzodiazepines, opioids), and avoiding a supine posture if OSA is position dependent. Although CPAP improves symptoms and is generally the preferred treatment for OSA, patient preference or intolerance to CPAP should prompt consideration of other treatments.

A secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) occurs in someone with known underlying lung disease, such as COPD. The risk of recurrence after an initial occurrence of a PSP is 17% to 54% in the first year. Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for PSP. The relative risk of a first event of PSP is 22-fold higher in men and 9 times higher in women who smoke tobacco than in those who do not smoke. The patient should be counseled to stop smoking and offered pharmacologic assistance. Other risk factors include tall height and a low body mass index. Treatment for a first episode of PSP is observation, oxygen and observation, needle aspiration, or placement of a small-bore thoracostomy, depending on symptomatology. Definitive treatment with pleurodesis to prevent recurrence is usually not provided until a second ipsilateral event has occurred, unless the patient's occupation is considered high risk. This patient is a professional scuba diver and is at high risk of death if he has a recurrence while diving. Flying at high altitude is also considered a high-risk occupation. Given the patient's occupation, a more definitive management plan should be pursued following insertion of tube thoracostomy with either mechanical or talc pleurodesis."

They may also experience hypotension, nausea, and muscle weakness. This patient has nonexertional heat stroke. It is generally defined by a core body temperature above 40 °C (104.0 °F) along with encephalopathy. Additional complications of heat stroke can include kidney and liver injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rhabdomyolysis. The elderly are particularly vulnerable, with added risk from comorbidities and medications. If untreated, mortality in heat stroke can reach 60%. Treatment of nonexertional heat stroke includes evaporative cooling (with water mist and fans) with or without ice packs to lower the core temperature to a safe temperature, usually 38.5 °C (101.3 °F).

Intense heat can cause edema and blistering from the mouth to the larynx, and patients with a visibly damaged airway or stridor are at high risk of complete upper airway obstruction due to swelling. It is difficult to predict which patients with acute inhalational injury will develop complete upper airway obstruction, and even patients with minimally apparent inhalational airway injury may develop worsening obstruction associated with intravenous hydration or analgesia needed for burn treatment. Following smoke inhalation, one third of patients develop airway edema or mucosal sloughing from epithelial necrosis. Chest physiotherapy and serial bronchoscopy are frequently necessary to facilitate continued airway clearance. Other presenting symptoms and signs of inhalation injury include stridor, dysphagia, singed nasal hairs, and sooty sputum, which signal the need for inspection of the upper airway. Immediate protection of the airway is indicated for patients with extensive facial or neck burns, decreased level of consciousness, or airway obstruction.

") to screen for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The diagnosis of CTEPH is difficult and can be overlooked as a cause of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In patients diagnosed with PH, evaluation for CTEPH is warranted even when a history of acute pulmonary embolism is absent. The incidence of CTEPH following acute pulmonary embolism is likely less than 5%. More than 20% of patients with CTEPH do not have a previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the diagnosis of CTEPH should not automatically be excluded in patients without a history of pulmonary embolism. In patients who develop or continue to have symptoms suggesting PH after 3 months of appropriate anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism, screening for CTEPH is warranted. A normal V/Q scan is sufficient to exclude CTEPH as its sensitivity for detecting chronic thrombus approaches 100%. An abnormal V/Q requires additional investigation, typically with right heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography."

However, these complications still occur. In this patient, rapid onset of hypotension and poor lung and heart sounds should prompt the clinician to evaluate for intrathoracic bleeding or pneumothorax.

"). The diagnosis of a malignant pleural effusion signifies advanced disease and overall poor prognosis (usually 4-7 months from the time of diagnosis). In these patients, the goal of management is relief of symptoms. Several therapeutic options exist, and treatment decisions should be based on symptoms, prognosis, degree of anticipated lung re-expansion, and patient performance status. The patient has a recurrent symptomatic malignant pleural effusion that requires definitive management given the rapidity of recurrence. Initial treatment choices include IPC and chemical pleurodesis with talc, and either may be used as first-line treatment in patients with expandable lung. In this patient, however, because there is evidence of incomplete lung expansion on his post-thoracentesis radiographs, the treatment of choice is IPC. Incomplete expansion of the lung is common in malignant pleural effusion. It is diagnosed with either pleural manometry (measurement of intrapleural pressures during a thoracentesis) or, as in this patient, evidence of incomplete re-expansion (air replacing the drained pleural effusion) on a post-thoracentesis chest radiograph. Nonexpandable lung has a variety of causes, including pleural thickening, pleural tumor, septations, loculations, and endobronchial obstruction."

PLCH, in contrast, is characterized by diffuse thin-walled cysts and nodular lesions in the mid- and upper lung zones. SRIF mimics RB-ILD on chest radiograph; however, it is pathologically distinct, with deposition of hyalinized collagen in alveolar septa and minimal inflammation. For all smoking-related DPLDs, smoking cessation is the cornerstone of treatment. Patients should receive behavioral counseling and at least one of seven FDA-approved treatments for smoking cessation."

"). As much as one fifth of the American work force maintains a job schedule outside of usual day shift hours. Although some people acclimate well to this schedule, many experience excessive sleepiness, mood perturbations, and neurocognitive dysfunction. Symptoms persisting at least 3 months meet the criteria for shift work sleep disorder. Management should first include counseling that takes into consideration eliminating shift work. If this is not feasible, then education about symptom management should be pursued. This patient has difficulty falling asleep after her nighttime shift. Education on avoidance of direct sunlight in the early morning (using sunglasses or a dark bedroom) and avoidance of exertion, eating, and alcohol consumption before the morning sleep period should be provided. Daytime sleepiness may respond to use of caffeinated beverages, bright-light exposure during the work shift, and if feasible, a short (30-minute) nap, perhaps during a meal break."

Obtaining a blood absolute eosinophil count will help establish the phenotype. In patients with severe disease, elevated levels of IgE and eosinophils are therapeutic targets for biologic therapies. Several types of biologic therapies are available that are directed against type 2 inflammation, targeting pathways involved in activation of eosinophils and IgE production. Use of antibody therapies in eligible patients with severe persistent allergic asthma despite standard therapy reduces symptoms, exacerbations, and need for oral glucocorticoids."

The diagnosis requires evidence of asthmatic symptoms for at least 3 months after the exposure and is confirmed by airway obstruction or bronchial hyperreactivity. The SDS includes information on the properties of each chemical on site, along with the physical, health, and environmental health hazards; protective measures; and safety precautions for handling, storing, and transporting the chemical. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires employers to make this information available upon request for employees who work with potentially harmful chemicals.

LMWH is strongly recommended over unfractionated heparin (UFH). Antithrombotic therapy markedly reduces mortality in nonpregnant and pregnant patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). LMWH is at least as effective as UFH in the treatment of VTE in pregnant patients, and the risks of bleeding are similar with the two agents. Extended use of UFH during pregnancy is associated with a risk of osteoporotic fracture of 2.2%. There is limited data on bone health in pregnant women receiving LMWH, but in nonpregnant women the risk of fracture appears to be higher in women receiving UFH compared with LMWH. In addition, the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is higher in nonpregnant women treated with UFH compared with LMWH (2.7% versus 0%). Finally, the ASH guideline notes that the dosing of LMWH is more predictable than UFH, and laboratory testing is generally unnecessary, making treatment more convenient."

Symptom onset is rapid (typically <8-12 weeks) and includes cough, wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, and manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes. The most frequent paraneoplastic syndrome is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This syndrome results from production of antidiuretic hormone by malignant cells. Other paraneoplastic syndromes associated with SCLC include Cushing syndrome, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, encephalomyelitis, and sensory neuropathy.

"). This patient has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Patients with IPF present with chronic shortness of breath and a dry cough. Patients typically have bibasilar inspiratory Velcro-like crackles, and clubbing is common. The prevalence of disease increases with age. A confident diagnosis can be made based on the presence of typical symptoms and a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on a high-resolution CT scan of the chest. IPF is progressive, with a median survival of 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. In 2014 the FDA approved two medications: pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent, and nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for use in patients with IPF. In clinical trials the two agents were found to have comparable efficacy in mitigating the rate of FVC decline by approximately 50% over the course of 1 year. They have also shown some efficacy in reducing severe respiratory events such as acute exacerbations and hospitalization. Common side effects are anorexia, nausea, photosensitivity (pirfenidone), and diarrhea (nintedanib). Although these medications delay IPF progression, they are not curative. Referral to a pulmonologist or interstitial lung disease center may be appropriate before initiating treatment with these medications. Lung transplantation is a life-prolonging therapy for those without comorbidities that may otherwise limit life expectancy. Early referral of eligible patients to a transplant center is appropriate given the unpredictability of disease progression."

"). For acutely hospitalized patients ventilated for more than 24 hours, guidelines suggest protocols to reduce sedation. Sedative-analgesic medications can cause excess sedation and may prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation. In randomized clinical trials, two strategies have been shown to be effective in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and its associated complication. The first strategy consists of intermittent intravenous administration of analgesia without sedatives (analgesia first approach). A second strategy consists of daily interruption of continuous infusion of analgesics and sedatives. Variations of these protocols exist, including targeting light sedation. The optimal strategy is not known, and guidelines offer no preference due to insufficient data, but all have in common periods of time in which the patient is awake. When implemented routinely, protocols that limit sedation or allow spontaneous awakening will decrease the length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and incidence of delirium. In this deeply sedated patient, stopping sedation and analgesics now will allow the fastest decrease in medication levels, thus allowing assessment of the patient."

"). Chylothorax refers to the presence of chyle within the pleural space. Chylothorax has both traumatic and nontraumatic causes. The most common traumatic cause is thoracic surgery. Esophagostomy carries the highest risk followed by mediastinal lymph node dissection, mediastinal tumor resection, and any surgery involving the lower neck and mediastinum. The most common nontraumatic cause is malignancy, of which lymphoma is the most common. Other possible nontraumatic causes include lymphatic disorders and chylous ascites. In patients with nontraumatic cases, the mechanism of the chylothorax varies with the underlying cause. In this patient it is most likely secondary to compressive obstruction due to bulky lymphadenopathy. Chest pain and fever are rare in patients with chylothorax, but the presence of fever may represent an underlying lymphoma. Chylous effusions have a high protein concentration making them exudates by Light's criteria. The explanation for elevated protein in a chylous effusion is unknown. The pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is typically low, reflective of a transudate. If elevated, it often reflects the underlying cause of the effusion, such as a malignancy. A chylothorax is diagnosed by a triglyceride level greater than 110 mg/dL (1.24 mmol/L), and it is typically a lymphocytic predominant effusion. Although chylothorax is often milky in appearance, as is a cholesterol effusion, it can appear serous or sanguineous."

It typically presents in patients between 50 and 70 years of age who have a greater than 6-month duration of a dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. History will reveal no potential cause for the development of fibrosis, and lung examination is notable for Velcro-like inspiratory crackles that are predominant at the bases. Clubbing is present in up to 50% of patients. The best diagnostic test is high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest, which may show abnormalities such as bilateral, peripheral, and basal predominant septal line thickening with honeycomb changes. The most appropriate next step in this patient's management is to discuss the patient's diagnosis in a multidisciplinary meeting involving a thoracic radiologist, a pathologist, and a pulmonologist; a multidisciplinary discussion may yield a confident diagnosis of IPF, without the need for a lung biopsy."

The patient is experiencing high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), which is caused by exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and abnormally high pulmonary artery and capillary pressures. The resulting leakage of edema fluid into the alveolus causes hypoxemia and may evoke an inflammatory response. Risks for this disorder include rapid ascent to altitudes greater than 2500 meters (~8200 feet), the actual altitude attained, time spent at altitude, and a history of high-altitude illness. The typical symptoms of HAPE (cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue) can be difficult to distinguish from pneumonia. As HAPE progresses, patients can develop pink frothy sputum, hemoptysis, and life-threatening hypoxemia. Treatment of HAPE focuses on promptly reducing the pulmonary artery pressure. This can be done by providing supplemental oxygen, limiting the patient's physical exertion and cold exposure, and advising the patient to descend to a lower altitude as soon as possible. This patient has received supplemental oxygen and should descend to a lower altitude. Some clinicians suggest the use of nifedipine as adjunctive therapy, but there is a paucity of data to confirm its benefit."

An incidentally found ground-glass nodule of 6 mm or larger necessitates follow-up chest CT at 6 to 12 months. If the nodule persists but is unchanged in size, as in this patient, chest CT should be repeated at 2-year intervals for 5 years. Earlier follow-up is unlikely to affect the outcome of these characteristically indolent lesions. Studies have shown that an average of 3 to 4 years is typically required to establish growth or, less commonly, to diagnose a developing invasive carcinoma.

The response to treatment depends on adherence; a substantial proportion of patients, particularly early in the course of therapy, do not use PAP as intended (all night, every night). Symptom burden probably drives adherence, but for those who lack motivation, educational programs can help, as can direct-to-patient reports wirelessly transmitted from the device to smartphones or computers. Adherence might be improved by addressing common adverse effects. Side effects such as xerostomia and nasal dryness and congestion can be ameliorated by in-line humidification. Intranasal glucocorticoids or anticholinergics may be useful for recalcitrant nasal congestion or rhinitis. Modified pressure profiles that slightly reduce pressure on exhalation may enhance comfort. Proper mask fit enhances comfort and mitigates air leak. PAP interfaces, ranging from nasal pillows that sit at the nasal openings to nasal masks that cover the nose to oronasal (full face) masks that cover the nose and mouth, are frequently updated and improved and may improve adherence. Download of data from the PAP device yields important information about use that the physician can discuss with the patient to explore barriers and formulate a plan to promote adherence."

A complicated parapneumonic effusion occurs when there has been bacterial invasion across the pleural mesothelium, stimulating a significant inflammatory response. A diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed to assess the pleural effusion. A parapneumonic effusion is considered complicated when an exudative effusion has either or both of the following characteristics: pH less than 7.2 (or glucose <40 mg/dL [2.2 mmol/L] in the absence of pH data) or evidence of microorganism invasion by culture or Gram stain. In the setting of suspected infection, a pleural fluid pH level of less than 7.2 is the best indicator of a complicated pleural effusion that requires drainage.

Accordingly, GINA guidelines recommend a daily inhaled glucocorticoid plus a SABA before exercise or low-dose budesonide-formoterol before exercise. Nonpharmacologic measures, including pre-exercise warm-up and warming cold air before inhalation (e.g., with a mask or scarf), are also recommended.

"). This patient has anaphylaxis from a Hymenoptera sting. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction caused by acute mediator release into the circulation, usually triggered by IgE-linked immunologic responses to specific foods, medications, insect venom, latex, or other antigens but sometimes occurring without an allergic trigger. The mediator release results in various clinical manifestations, including pruritus, hypotension, tachycardia, and airway compromise with bronchoconstriction. Initial treatment of anaphylaxis is with epinephrine, which may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously. Mechanisms of action of epinephrine include vasoconstriction, respiratory smooth muscle relaxation, and stabilization of degranulating inflammatory cells. Some patients, such as this one, require repeat doses of epinephrine or even an intravenous epinephrine infusion if anaphylaxis persists. Patients should be given supplemental oxygen and watched closely for signs of airway compromise, such as stridor or obstruction due to a swollen tongue, which may require intubation to maintain airway patency. Patients often require fluid resuscitation, with or without vasopressor therapy. Factors that increase risk for biphasic anaphylaxis (anaphylaxis occurring 1-72 hours after resolution of the initial episode) include a severe initial episode and a need for more than one dose of epinephrine. When such risk exists, or when there is risk of anaphylaxis fatality due to coexisting cardiovascular disease or lack of access to epinephrine or emergency services, extended observation of up to 6 hours or longer may be warranted."

Occupational asthma includes both asthma caused by exposure to sensitizing or irritant substances in the workplace and preexisting asthma that is exacerbated by these same factors. Typical sensitizing agents are high-molecular-weight substances, such as proteins, that induce an IgE-mediated immunologic response. In bakers' asthma, exposure to proteins in wheat and rye flour is a likely cause. Once sensitized, patients may react to very low levels of exposure. A key clinical indicator is the relationship of symptoms to work exposure; patients often improve on weekends and during time away from work. Spirometry before and after workplace exposures is a cost-effective way to confirm a suspected diagnosis of occupational asthma. Alternatively, serial peak flow measurements can be used. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, treatment consists of reducing exposure to the offending agent through workplace modifications or removing patients from the workplace entirely."

PET utilizes the radionuclide 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose, which accumulates within highly metabolically active cells such as cancer cells and can be visualized as discrete areas of uptake. Integrated PET/CT allows improved localization of the metabolic activity. PET scans are widely used to evaluate risk of malignancy in lung nodules, to stage known thoracic tumors, and to evaluate for metastatic disease from other nonthoracic malignancies. False-positive PET scans can occur in other hypermetabolic conditions, such as infection or inflammation, in which cells accumulate fluorodeoxyglucose. False-negative results can occur when tumors have low rates of metabolic activity, such as carcinoid, adenocarcinoma in situ, and, rarely, metastatic kidney, prostate, or testicular cancer. PET is not useful in determining malignancy in lung nodules less than 8 mm in size; however, a PET/CT scan can help in staging and needle positioning for biopsy targets. For example, in this patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule, a PET/CT scan may help determine whether any lymph node involvement is present that was not visible on the chest CT scan, providing a potentially more accessible and strategically important biopsy target."

The patient has hypercapnic respiratory failure due to a combination of opiates (oxycodone) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), in which the obesity has led to mechanical changes that increase the load that the respiratory muscles must overcome. The addition of opiates decreased the respiratory drive in a patient that had underlying hypoventilation. BPAP delivers a higher level of positive airway pressure during inspiration than during expiration. In the acute setting, the difference between expiratory and inspiratory pressure helps the respiratory muscles generate appropriate tidal volumes. A backup respiratory rate can also be designated to initiate breaths in patients who have a low respiratory rate. The 2019 guidelines from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend that hospitalized patients suspected of having OHS should be started on noninvasive ventilation with either BPAP or volume-targeted pressure support and continued on this therapy until they undergo outpatient evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ideally during the first 3 months after hospital discharge."

"). The patient presents with a chest mass in the superior sulcus that has led to shoulder and arm pain, weakness and atrophy of the muscles of the hand, and Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis). This constellation of symptoms is called Pancoast syndrome and is typically caused by tumor infiltration of the brachial plexus and/or extension of the tumor into the parietal pleural, ribs, or vertebral bodies. These tumors are typically non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and do not present with symptoms of dyspnea or cough until late because of their peripheral location. Diagnosis of these tumors can be delayed by several months because patients may first be treated for shoulder bursitis or arthritis. Superior sulcus tumors are staged the same way as NSCLC elsewhere in the chest. Initial evaluation should start with a full history, physical examination, complete blood count, serum chemistry studies, and CT of the chest. The presence of findings on physical examination (consolidation, effusion, bone tenderness, neurologic findings) will indicate advanced disease. PET can be very helpful in the initial evaluation of potential lung cancer, as several studies have demonstrated that PET identifies unsuspected mediastinal involvement, distant disease, or both, which informs staging biopsies and reduces futile (noncurative) surgery. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires tissue histopathology. In patients with radiographic evidence of advanced stage disease, diagnosis and staging are best accomplished with a single invasive test at a location that will establish both the diagnosis and the stage of disease."

"). Pulse oximetry calculates the differential between absorption of infrared light by oxygenated and deoxygenated blood and is widely used to monitor oxygenation. Conventional probes used on the finger, toe, and earlobe rely on transmission technology, utilizing emitting and detecting sensors applied on opposing sides of the digit or earlobe. Inaccurate readings can be caused by vasoconstriction, low perfusion states, skin pigmentation, motion artifact, or nail polish. The clinician should examine the pulse oximeter waveform to determine if the reading is accurate; a normal signal shows a sharp waveform with a clear dicrotic notch. The absence of a clear dicrotic notch suggests the device is not providing an accurate reading. In a patient with Raynaud phenomenon and clinical signs of peripheral vasoconstriction, pulse oximetry with a finger probe is likely to be erroneous. Options include changing to an earlobe probe or use of reflectance technology with a forehead probe in which the emitter and detector sensors are adjacent to each other."

Studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate is decreased with a restrictive transfusion strategy, defined as a hemoglobin goal of 7 to 9 g/dL (70-90 g/L), compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. However, different thresholds and hemoglobin levels may trigger transfusion in actively bleeding patients who are in shock. Higher hemoglobin values may also be desirable in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic cardiovascular disease. In patients with portal hypertension, transfusion to higher values (10 g/dL [100 g/L] or higher) can rapidly increase portal pressure, putting the patient at significant risk for rebleeding.

Indications for hemodialysis for the ingestion of ethylene glycol or methanol include severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and end-organ involvement (kidney impairment, visual changes). Hemodialysis removes the parent alcohol and its toxic metabolites. It should be performed as soon as possible in confirmed ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning or in suspected cases associated with increased anion gap metabolic acidosis or symptoms of end organ damage. Toxic alcohol ingestion is typically confirmed by drug level measurements, which can take hours to days; hemodialysis would be appropriate now because this patient's presentation is highly suggestive: ethylene glycol is found in automotive coolants; the patient has severe acidemia with an anion gap of 22 and normal glucose and lactate levels; and the osmolal gap is elevated."

A 2018 meta-analysis of 42 trials concluded that although there was no evidence that glucocorticoids improve mortality, patients with septic shock who receive glucocorticoids are more likely to have reversal of shock within 7 days. Guidelines published by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine in 2017 recommend consideration of glucocorticoids for patients with refractory septic shock at a maximum dose of 400 mg hydrocortisone daily or the equivalent using another glucocorticoid.

"). After initiation of asthma therapies, patients should be reassessed for symptom control and medication tolerance. Montelukast has been associated with significant adverse mental health effects and may be the cause of the patient's depression. Depressive symptoms can occur in patients with and without a previous history of depression or other neuropsychiatric disorders. In March 2020 the FDA added a boxed warning to montelukast, strengthening previous warnings about behavior and mood-related changes, including suicides, associated with this medication. The FDA also advised against using montelukast for allergic rhinitis because other first-line medications, such as intranasal glucocorticoids, are widely available and more efficacious and because many physicians are unaware of montelukast's potential adverse mental health effects. This patient's asthma symptoms are well controlled, and he has new symptoms and a positive Patient Health Questionnaire-2 result suggesting depression; therefore, montelukast should be discontinued, and the patient should be monitored for improvement in his depressive symptoms, which typically resolve if medication related. Other adverse effects include anaphylaxis, angioedema, dizziness, dyspepsia, muscle weakness, and elevated transaminases occurring in less than 2% of all patients. The occurrence of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis has been described in patients taking antileukotriene agents, but most cases occur following discontinuation of glucocorticoids for severe asthma and may simply represent an uncovering of a previously undiagnosed condition. It remains unclear if this adverse event is caused by the drug."

Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta have an increased propensity for bleeding due to dysfunctional interactions between platelets and endothelial cells. In addition, collagen defects can lead to increased fragility of capillary beds. Patients with hemorrhagic shock should be managed with volume repletion, and IV crystalloid solution should be initiated while waiting for blood products. This patient has a single peripheral IV with which to start resuscitation, but a second access point should be obtained in case the first IV becomes dysfunctional. According to the law of Poiseuille, the flow of fluid through a tube is dictated in part by the radius and length of the tube. If we apply this to venous access catheters, choosing a device that is short and has a wide diameter lumen will maximize flow rates through the catheter for volume resuscitation."

Risk factors for serotonin syndrome include use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other medications (sometimes more than one) that increase nervous system serotonin activity. This patient takes paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Tramadol and cocaine also increase serotonin release in the central nervous system. Common signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include mental status changes, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tremor, autonomic instability, muscle and ocular clonus, and hyperreflexia. Treatment includes supportive measures, such as avoidance of any further serotonergic agents, and sedation with benzodiazepines to reduce agitation. Sedation blunts autonomic surges and reduces the muscle activity that contributes to hyperthermia. Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine with antiserotonergic activity, is used off-label as an antidote in serotonin syndrome in patients who do not respond to benzodiazepine therapy. Its effectiveness has not been established in clinical trials, and use is based on expert opinion and case series. It is available only in pill and syrup formulations so must be administered orally, which is sometimes a challenge in uncooperative patients."

Malignant hyperthermia is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by diffuse skeletal muscle activation that results from intracellular calcium release. It is triggered most often by inhaled anesthetics and the depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine. Presenting signs and symptoms reflect hypermetabolism and include muscle rigidity (including masseter muscle rigidity), tachycardia, tachypnea, laboratory evidence of rhabdomyolysis (elevated serum creatine kinase, potassium, and phosphorus levels and myoglobinuria), and temperature that can be strikingly high, 45.0 °C (113.0 °F) or more. Mortality can reach 10%. Treatment consists of discontinuing the triggering agent, active cooling, and administration of the muscle relaxant dantrolene every 5 to 10 minutes until muscle rigidity and hyperthermia resolve. Dantrolene interferes with intracellular calcium release and is considered an antidote to malignant hyperthermia. Patients should be monitored in the ICU for 24 hours following an episode of malignant hyperthermia."

"). Prevention of lung cancer through reduction in smoking is the most important way to reduce the burden of disease. Survival rates are directly linked to cancer stage at the time of diagnosis. Many lung cancers are diagnosed at a late stage; thus, several randomized clinical trials have evaluated screening measures. The randomized National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) compared LDCT screening with chest radiography over 3 years among patients ages 55 to 74 years with at least a 30-pack-year history of smoking who currently smoked or had quit in the past 15 years. The trial showed a relative mortality reduction of 20% in the LDCT screening group. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and other societies now recommend LDCT screening for lung cancer in high-risk populations. The USPSTF recommends screening patients ages 50 through 80 years who have no symptoms of lung cancer, have at least a 20-pack-year smoking history, and are current smokers or have quit within the last 15 years. Cessation of screening should also be considered in those who have not smoked in 15 years, those with limited life expectancy, and those who would not be candidates for or would not be willing to undergo surgery. This patient is at high risk because of her age and smoking history and should undergo annual LDCT. Screening has potential harms, including the consequences of evaluating abnormal results (additional tests and procedures), radiation exposure, patient distress, and overdiagnosis. It is desirable that lung cancer screening take place in a center that has radiologic, diagnostic, and treatment capabilities similar to those of centers involved in the NLST."

Cardiogenic shock occurs when a primary cardiac insult causes decreased cardiac output.

A transthoracic echocardiogram provides information on heart size, systolic and diastolic function, regional wall motion abnormalities, and valvular disease. Regional wall motion abnormalities suggest coronary artery disease, and changes in the myocardium can suggest conditions such as cardiac amyloid.

"). A sleep study showed that this patient has central sleep apnea (CSA). CSA is defined by pauses in airflow due to loss of output from the central respiratory generators in the brainstem to the respiratory muscles, resulting in lack of respiratory effort. There are few clinical trials proving a role for specific treatment of CSA, so initial management should target modifiable risk factors. For example, reduction or elimination of opioids improves CSA. Medical optimization of heart failure (with drugs or devices, optimizing fluid balance in the setting of volume overload, or surgery such as valve repair or cardiac transplantation) has been shown to improve CSA. This patient's CSA is most likely related to use of opioid analgesics. Because initial management of CSA should target modifiable risk factors, a pain rehabilitation program to help the patient curtail opioid use is appropriate. Additionally, a more appropriate long-term pain management strategy is needed to improve her quality of life. However, adherence to a pain management plan that includes opioid reduction may be difficult and failure is frequent."

"). Numerous studies in the literature have documented excessive use of laboratory studies in the hospital setting in general and in the ICU in particular. Estimates suggest that approximately 20% of laboratory tests obtained in hospitalized patients are not needed, resulting in waste. In addition to the financial impact to the health care system, overutilization invariably results in false-positive test results, leading to further downstream testing. Studies show that excessive blood draws can result in iatrogenic anemia, as is likely the case in this patient. Efforts to reduce unnecessary laboratory testing have the dual benefit of improving patient safety and reducing health care expenditures. Studies have shown that a reduction in laboratory testing does not lead to adverse patient outcomes, and some studies suggest a decrease in hospital lengths of hospital stay and the need for transfusion. The first management step in this patient is to discontinue daily routine laboratory testing. Laboratory testing should only be undertaken in response to specific clinical questions."

Patients with preeclampsia are also at risk of developing HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), which has been associated with increased rates of maternal morbidity and mortality.

Measurement of the fraction of nitric oxide in an exhaled breath sample provides a noninvasive way to quantify eosinophilic airway inflammation and serves as a complementary tool in the diagnosis and management of asthma. However, his cough and other symptoms suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a common asthma comorbidity. At each asthma visit, clinicians should assess patient symptom control, inhaler technique and adherence, and comorbidities such as rhinosinusitis, obesity, and GERD. GERD is more common in patients with asthma than the general population and may contribute to respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. Potential mechanisms by which GERD may cause cough or worsened asthma control include increased vagal tone, bronchial hyperreactivity, and microaspiration of gastric contents into the upper airways. Empiric treatment of GERD in patients without worrisome symptoms such as weight loss, dysphagia, or hematemesis consists of a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole."

This clinical scenario strongly suggests malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm that originates from the cells that line the pleural cavity (mesothelium). It can present as small nodules, plaque-like masses, or confluent sheets that can encase the lung. It is associated with inhalational exposure to asbestos fibers and has a latency of 20 to 40 years. Tissue biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis; it can be performed with medical thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which has 90% sensitivity for malignancy. Because mesothelioma can be difficult to diagnose, patients will typically present with advanced disease. Other conditions that may have a similar presentation include a chronic empyema and malignant conditions such as sarcomas and peripheral adenocarcinomas."

After tissue confirmation, mesothelioma is staged according to the TNM system; PET is often performed to help determine the extent of involvement. If there is limited involvement and no distant disease, some patients will benefit from surgery as well as chemotherapy and radiation. Prognosis for mesothelioma depends on the histologic features (sarcomatoid versus epithelioid) and staging at diagnosis, but overall it remains poor (median survival, 6-9 months)."

A patulous esophagus can be seen on the chest CT scan. Radiographic findings mirror those of other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, with the nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern characterized by ground-glass opacities with predominance at the base of the lungs seen in this patient. This radiographic pattern is present in more than 80% of persons with systemic sclerosis–associated ILD. In patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease, the presence of an underlying connective tissue disease has prognostic and therapeutic implications.

There is moderate evidence that compared with placebo, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), but not sucralfate, reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, with PPIs likely to be more effective than H2RAs. Patients at highest risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (risk >4%) benefited the most. Patients at highest risk were identified as those with a coagulopathy, those with chronic liver disease, and those receiving mechanical ventilation but not enteral nutrition. Highest risk patients also included those with two or more of the following risk factors: mechanical ventilation with enteral nutrition, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and shock. Compared with placebo, the absolute difference in bleeding rates for patients at highest risk receiving a PPI was 3.3%.

The Asthma Control Test and the Asthma Control Questionnaire are standardized, validated questionnaires that can discriminate between well-controlled and inadequately controlled asthma based on patient symptoms. These symptom control tools provide scores and cut points to distinguish different levels of control and to assess the patient's progress. When different systems are used to assess asthma control, the results broadly correlate but are not identical and using the same tool for each patient is most reasonable. Numerical asthma control tools are more sensitive to change in symptom control than categorical tools. In the Asthma Control Test, scores range from 5 to 25, with a higher score indicating better asthma control. Scores that correspond to other than well-controlled asthma suggest the need to review asthma risk factors, exposures, adherence, and inhaler technique, and the need for step-up therapy."

") is not recommended to guide asthma treatment in the general population. Studies have demonstrated that FeNO-guided treatment reduces exacerbation rates compared with guideline-based treatment, but further studies are needed to identify the populations of patients most likely to benefit from FeNO-guided care and the optimal frequency of FeNO monitoring. For example, the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program conditionally recommends FeNO monitoring in patients with persistent allergic asthma, for whom there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy. Similarly, the 2021 American Thoracic Society guideline offers a conditional recommendation that measurement of FeNO be completed in patients with asthma in whom treatment is being considered. Although such testing may reduce asthma exacerbations, other important outcomes such as overall asthma control and acute care visits and hospitalizations for asthma, did not reach statistical significance. This patient does not need FeNO measurement."

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and approved pharmacotherapy to adult tobacco users. Combining behavioral counseling with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either modality alone. Effective counseling and behavioral resources include problem-solving guidance (e.g., developing a plan to quit and overcoming barriers), motivational interviewing, social support, and telephone quit lines. There is a dose-response relationship between the intensity and frequency of counseling and quit rates, which seems to plateau after 90 minutes of total counseling. All smokers without contraindications should additionally receive at least one of the FDA-approved treatments for smoking cessation, which include nicotine replacement medications, bupropion, and varenicline. Varenicline is superior to single forms of nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion. Moderate- and high-dose preparations of nicotine replacement therapy are more effective than lower-dose ones, and combining more than one type of nicotine replacement therapy (short-acting and long-acting) is more effective than monotherapy. Initiation of nicotine replacement therapy before smoking is stopped may also increase quitting success rates."

Alcohol intoxication due to ethanol and isopropyl alcohol is managed with supportive care.

The presence of heart failure, hepatomegaly and possible ascites, her occupational history, and her history of breast cancer broaden the differential diagnosis. Given the diagnostic uncertainty of the cause of the effusion, it should be sampled. The effusion was bloody in appearance and exudative by all three of Light's criteria (ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein >0.5, ratio of pleural-fluid lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] to serum LDH greater than 0.6, and pleural-fluid LDH greater than two thirds of the upper limit of normal for serum LDH). There are many causes of exudative effusions, but the most common are infection and malignancy. Given her history of breast cancer, the bloody appearance and exudative characteristic of the effusion make it highly suspicious for malignancy. While pleural fluid cytology is pending, it may not be very helpful. The sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology is approximately 60%, and some estimates suggest that it might even be lower (46%) when all types of malignancy are included. The sensitivity is highest for adenocarcinomas (79%) and lowest for mesothelioma (11%). Given the high suspicion of malignancy in this patient, additional testing should be pursued consisting of a repeat thoracentesis with cytology (if the first sample is negative) or thoracoscopic pleural biopsy."

"). Patients with critical illness should receive early oral feeding when possible and should be considered at risk for malnutrition when they have not received nutrition for more than 48 hours. If oral nutrition is not feasible, early enteral nutrition is indicated to minimize infectious complications associated with delayed enteral nutrition. New guidelines suggest that, in malnourished patients, caloric and protein needs should be increased gradually to their goal over the course of 3 to 7 days to avoid risks associated with early refeeding syndrome. When patients are chronically malnourished or endure prolonged starvation, the body shifts from metabolizing carbohydrates to metabolizing protein and fat as the main source of adenosine triphosphate production. In the process, intracellular depletion of key electrolytes such as potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium begins to occur. When carbohydrates or other simple sugars are reintroduced to the diet or given intravenously, production of insulin causes rapid intracellular uptake and a rapid drop in extracellular concentrations of electrolytes. These shifts have potentially life-threatening consequences, including diaphragmatic weakness and respiratory impairment, tissue hypoxia, fatal arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathies. Guidelines suggest that enteral intake should be increased slowly over a period of 3 to 7 days. Should electrolyte levels markedly decrease from their baseline, suggesting refeeding syndrome, these abnormalities should be corrected and the number of calories the patient is receiving should be either reduced or held steady."

The patient is receiving inadequate pain control; the addition of multimodal pain control, which may include increased dosage of morphine, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentin, or nerve blocks, will improve pain control and chest expansion and may resolve the atelectasis.

"). In patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and lower respiratory tract infiltrate, it is often difficult to determine whether the cause of the infiltrates is a bacterial infection or another source such as a viral infection or aspiration pneumonitis. Ultimately, the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis is clinical. Indicators include abrupt onset of respiratory symptoms following aspiration of gastric contents, low-grade fever, and infiltrates on chest imaging. The 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends standard empiric treatment for CAP in patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. Many patients with aspiration pneumonitis experience rapid resolution of symptoms within 24 to 48 hours. In these patients, removal of antibiotics and supportive care alone is preferred. Because this patient improved clinically within 24 hours of admission, aspiration pneumonitis is likely and it is safe to discontinue therapy."

Chest CT findings are nonspecific and primarily parenchymal; bilateral well-demarcated ground-glass opacities or ill-defined centrilobular nodules may be noted.

"). CTEPH consists of organized, chronic thrombi within the pulmonary arterial system. Patients with CTEPH demonstrate both mechanical obstruction of pulmonary arteries and features of disordered pulmonary angiogenesis, fibrinolysis, and vascular remodeling. These changes manifest in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure. Untreated, CTEPH can lead to right-sided heart failure and death. Lifelong anticoagulation to help prevent further thromboembolism and consideration of thromboendarterectomy are indicated for CTEPH. The only potentially curative therapy for CTEPH is pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Because the disease is usually progressive, surgical evaluation at an experienced center is warranted in all patients with CTEPH, regardless of disease severity. Approximately half of patients with CTEPH will be eligible for surgery. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy can result in normalization of pulmonary hemodynamics in about one third of patients who undergo surgery."

Important risk factors include a history of near-fatal asthma attack or intubation; an emergency department or hospital visit in the last 12 months; poor asthma medication adherence or not using inhaled glucocorticoid; current or recent treatment with an oral glucocorticoid; psychosocial stressors or psychiatric disease; food allergy; and overuse of a short-acting β",
