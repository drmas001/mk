The 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guideline on management of blood cholesterol recommends initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy in adults aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus, regardless of the calculated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. The guideline also notes that risk assessment using the AHA/ACC Pooled Cohort Equations can be considered in patients with diabetes to assess the need for high-intensity statin therapy. This patient with type 2 diabetes has a 10-year ASCVD risk of 3.8%, and high-intensity statin therapy is not indicated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults without a history of cardiovascular disease use a low- to moderate-intensity statin for the prevention of ASCVD events and mortality when all of the following criteria are met: (1) they are aged 40 to 75 years; (2) they have one or more ASCVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking); and (3) they have a calculated 10-year risk for an ASCVD event of 10% or greater."
