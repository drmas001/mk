"). ALS often begins as asymmetric distal extremity weakness or with bulbar symptoms, such as dysphagia, dysarthria, or tongue weakness. The clinical course is rapid, progressive, and irreversible. In this patient, the presence of both lower motor neuron findings, such as atrophy and fasciculations, and upper motor neuron signs, such as hyperreflexia, clonus, and brisk jaw jerk, suggest ALS. In patients with these findings, diagnosis can be confirmed with electromyographic evidence of lower motor neuron signs in at least two (probable ALS) or more (definite ALS) regions. An alternative cause should be ruled out by cervical spine neuroimaging and assessment for thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction, copper and vitamin B",
