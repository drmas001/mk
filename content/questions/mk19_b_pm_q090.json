") and monitoring for signs of alcohol withdrawal. The patient is intoxicated by the high alcohol concentrations found in hand sanitizer. Most sanitizers contain ethanol or isopropyl alcohol in concentrations generally above 60%. Ethanol and other ingested alcohols activate the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor, which is the primary central nervous system inhibitor; this in turn leads to central nervous system depression, including loss of consciousness and suppression of respiratory drive at high doses, which can lead to respiratory failure or aspiration events. Alcohol intoxication due to ethanol and isopropyl alcohol is managed with supportive care. The patient has a history of chronic alcoholism, and once the acute intoxication subsides, he should be monitored for signs of alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can begin within hours to days of the last ingestion and can be fatal."

") has been used historically as a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase in the setting of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. It should not be given in the setting of ethanol toxicity and also has no role in isopropyl alcohol ingestion. When either methanol or ethylene glycol has been ingested, there is an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis as well as an increased osmolal gap that provides an important clue to the correct diagnosis. In this case the presence of an osmolal gap and normal anion gap support the diagnosis of isopropyl alcohol poisoning."

There is reluctance to use flumazenil even in benzodiazepine overdose. Administration of flumazenil for suspected benzodiazepine overdose can reverse the effect of benzodiazepines leading to life-threatening central nervous system activation, including seizures, which are most likely in patients taking benzodiazepines chronically."
