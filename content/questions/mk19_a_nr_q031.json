Associated features are photophobia, nausea, and ipsilateral tearing. Nasal sumatriptan, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen have not relieved the pain. He has a 7-pack-year smoking history."

"). The clinical presentation is classic for episodic cluster headache, the most common of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs). Male gender and tobacco use are risk factors for cluster headache. Diagnostic criteria require one to eight daily episodes lasting 15 to 180 minutes when untreated. The pain is unilateral and severe and orbital, supraorbital, or temporal in location. Associated features must include at least one ipsilateral cranial autonomic feature (lacrimation, nasal stuffiness or rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection, ptosis, miosis) and/or a sense of restlessness or agitation. Cluster headache has a cyclical nature in which periods of recurrent headache activity are interrupted by months to years of headache remission. Many of the attacks are nocturnal, and some may be provoked by alcohol ingestion. When cluster headache (or any TAC) is suspected, brain MRI is necessary to rule out structural mimics. Subcutaneous sumatriptan and 100% oxygen inhalation are both effective for cluster headache and indicated as first-line treatments of attacks."

Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania is a TAC related to cluster headache that is indomethacin responsive, but episodes are shorter in duration (2-30 minutes) and higher in frequency (5-20 per day) compared with cluster headache. Hemicrania continua and primary cough headache are other examples of indomethacin-responsive headache disorders."

Although the differential diagnosis of a headache with ptosis and miosis (partial Horner syndrome) includes carotid artery dissection, this diagnosis is unlikely with a pattern of daily, brief, episodic headaches over a span of 2 weeks."
