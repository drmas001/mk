"The most likely diagnosis is renal artery stenosis. The magnetic resonance renal angiogram shows bilateral ostial renal artery stenosis as the result of atherosclerotic renal vascular disease. Three randomized controlled trials (STAR, ASTRAL, and CORAL) failed to show that renal artery angioplasty confers additional benefit above optimal medical therapy for patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease who have stable kidney function. Patients who may benefit from percutaneous angioplasty and stenting or surgical intervention include those who present with a short duration of hypertension; fail medical therapy; or have severe hypertension or recurrent flash pulmonary edema, refractory heart failure, acute kidney injury following treatment with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, or progressive impaired kidney function."
