"). She is immunocompromised and has herpes zoster infection, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). In immunocompetent persons, disseminated herpes zoster is defined as involvement of more than two dermatomes or vesicular lesions that cross the midline. In immunocompromised persons, the risk for dissemination is increased, thus any dermatomal involvement is considered disseminated zoster. Disseminated herpes zoster infection includes a risk of VZV dissemination to the respiratory tract; transmission to nonimmune health care personnel or other patients (no history of naturally acquired chickenpox or unvaccinated) can then occur by direct contact with vesicles or by small (â‰¤5 microns) airborne respiratory droplets. Patients with disseminated zoster should be cared for using contact (gloves and gown for all contact) and airborne (an airborne infection isolation room, also referred to as a negative pressure room) precautions; health care personnel should also wear fit-tested N95 respirators."
