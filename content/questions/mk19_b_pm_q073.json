Tube feedings were initiated 48 hours after ICU admission but have not advanced above 50% of her nutritional goal because of recurrent abdominal distention and emesis. She has lost 1.8 kg (4 lb) over the last week. The ileostomy bag contains gas and liquid feces. Medications are low-molecular-weight heparin, metoclopramide, fentanyl, piperacillin-tazobactam, mesalamine, and oral budesonide."

"). Malnutrition in critically ill patients leads to increased morbidity and mortality. All patients admitted to the ICU should have a nutritional evaluation. Enteral nutrition should start within 24 to 48 hours of admission in critically ill patients. Guidelines recommend that parenteral nutrition to achieve full nutritional goals should be started only after 7 to 10 days of inability to achieve more than 60% of energy and protein requirements by the enteral route alone. Initiating parenteral nutrition before 7 to 10 days in critically ill patients on some enteral nutrition does not improve outcomes and may be detrimental to the patient."
