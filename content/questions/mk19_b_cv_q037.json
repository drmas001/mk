"). A wide-complex tachycardia is any tachycardia with a QRS complex of 120 ms or longer. Differential diagnoses include supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, preexcited tachycardia (antidromic tachycardia), ventricular paced rhythm, and VT. In adult patients with structural heart disease, 95% of wide-complex tachycardias are VT. Several important clinical and ECG features can distinguish VT from other conditions. The presence of irregular jugular venous pulsations of greater amplitude than normal venous waves (cannon waves) signal the presence of atrioventricular dissociation and support the diagnosis of VT. Wide-complex tachycardias that are positive in lead aVR, have a QRS morphology that is concordant (all predominantly positive or negative) in the precordial leads, have QRS morphology other than typical right or left bundle branch block, and exhibit extreme axis deviation (“northwest” axis) are usually VT. Fusion beats (supraventricular and ventricular impulses coinciding to produce a hybrid complex) ",
