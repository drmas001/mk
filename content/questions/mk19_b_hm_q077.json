She has low-risk MDS with 5q−. This subtype of MDS typically has a good prognosis, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require therapy. However, this patient is experiencing symptomatic anemia requiring frequent transfusions. Lenalidomide has been shown to effectively decrease transfusion requirements in patients with the 5q− cytogenetic abnormality, and more than 50% of patients can become transfusion independent. By eliminating or lowering the transfusion need, lenalidomide indirectly lowers the risk of iron overload and alloimmunization. Lenalidomide may also delay leukemic transformation, leading to improved survival in patients who respond well to treatment. Patients who do not respond to lenalidomide may require salvage therapy with hypomethylating agents such as azacytidine and decitabine. These agents decrease transfusion dependence and the risk of conversion to acute myeloid leukemia."
