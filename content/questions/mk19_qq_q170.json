"), a psychotic disorder characterized by persistent false beliefs that the patient remains convinced to be true despite evidence to the contrary. Symptoms must be present for at least 1 month, typically only impair function minimally, and may or may not be distressing to the patient. Because patients often do not perceive the delusion as problematic, they may not seek medical attention voluntarily. Common delusional themes include paranoia (often about persecution or infidelity), grandiosity (belief in special worth, knowledge, power, or status), erotomania (belief that a person with elevated status is in love with the patient), or, as with this patient, somatic delusions of physical defect or abnormality. Symptoms diagnostic of other psychotic disorders, including disorganized thinking, motor dysfunction, and negative symptoms, must not be present."
