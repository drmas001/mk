"). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends initiation of insulin therapy for treatment for persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold of 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). After insulin therapy is started, a target glucose range of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8-10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for most critically ill and non-critically ill patients. Basal insulin is long-acting insulin given once daily; prandial insulin is scheduled short-acting insulin given three times daily with each meal; and correctional insulin is dosing in response to continued elevated glucose rather than preemptively. A correctional dose of short-acting insulin should be given in addition to the scheduled prandial insulin to correct for hyperglycemia before eating. This approach leads to improved outcomes and avoids large fluctuations in glucose values through the day. A randomized controlled trial has shown that basal-prandial insulin treatment improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications compared with use of only correctional insulin (“sliding scale insulin”) regimens in general surgery patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
