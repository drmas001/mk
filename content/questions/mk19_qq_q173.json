"). Prepatellar bursitis is caused by inflammation of the prepatellar bursa that overlies the patella. Patients present with anterior knee pain and swelling. Physical examination reveals a palpable fluid collection with preserved active and passive knee range of motion. Repetitive trauma (e.g., kneeling with gardening) predisposes to the development of bursitis but does not rule out other possible or additional diagnoses, namely infection and crystalline disease. Skin lesions overlying the bursa, including psoriasis and eczema, may predispose to septic bursitis. Aspiration is necessary to establish the diagnosis and determine the treatment plan. Bursal fluid cell count, polarized microscopy for crystals, Gram stain, and culture should be performed. An extremely elevated leukocyte count (>50,000/ÂµL [50 x 10",

},
"/L]) should raise suspicion for septic bursitis, although a lower count does not eliminate this possibility. Furthermore, both crystalline and infectious disease can coexist, increasing the importance of Gram stain and culture results. Treatment of noninfectious bursitis includes drainage of the fluid, compression to prevent re-accumulation, anti-inflammatory agents, and measures to avoid future trauma to the bursa. Antibiotics and drainage are indicated for septic bursitis."
