"). Anticentromere antibodies (titer of 1:80 or higher) are rare in healthy people. The finding of anticentromere antibodies (ACAs) in the setting of Raynaud phenomenon is 60% sensitive and 98% specific for LcSSc, which was previously known as the CREST syndrome. Patients with LcSSc have manifestations that can include calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia (CREST); all five conditions may not be present. The presence of anticentromere antibodies increases the risk for pulmonary hypertension, which occurs in 20% of these patients. Patients who have only Raynaud phenomenon and ACA must be followed for development of LcSSc. This patient with recent onset of Raynaud phenomenon is showing features of LcSSc. Although gastroesophageal reflux disease is common in the general population, the recent onset of telangiectasias and sclerodactyly suggests LcSSc. The telangiectasias seen in LcSSc are matted; these clusters of dilated vessels appear as small pink or red macules that blanch on light pressure. They are most commonly seen on the face, mucous membrane, and hands."
