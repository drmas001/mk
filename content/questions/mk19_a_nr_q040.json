"). This patient has an unruptured intracranial arterial aneurysm that is less than 12 mm in the anterior circulation (anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and internal carotid arteries). Such aneurysms are associated with a low risk for rupture at 5 years. Aneurysms that are less than 7 mm in the posterior circulation (posterior communicating and basilar arteries) have a similarly low risk for rupture. Factors associated with increased risk for rupture include rapid growth detected over serial imaging, active tobacco use, and uncontrolled hypertension. Other predictors of aneurysmal rupture that should prompt surgical consideration include a previous aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, rapid aneurysm growth, or the presence of cranial nerve palsy. Annual noninvasive imaging is recommended in patients with an unruptured aneurysm. CT or MRI angiography can be considered for serial imaging because they are both noninvasive, with CT usually performed in patients who cannot undergo MRI. Additional noninvasive testing on a yearly basis should be performed to track aneurysm growth, which may be a predictor for rupture."

") are not indicated because this patient's risk for rupture is low, and the associated neurologic disability and morbidity with intervention are high. In patients with a ruptured aneurysm, neurosurgical clipping versus endovascular coiling has similar success at occlusion of the aneurysm, and the choice of one modality over another is dictated by aneurysm shape and location and by operator experience."
