") is a common cause of this form of diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea can be classified as osmotic, secretory, steatorrhea, inflammatory, motility, or miscellaneous. Classification allows narrowing the differential diagnosis to guide selective laboratory testing and imaging. Stool electrolytes measured in liquid stool can help identify osmotic diarrhea, as indicated by a fecal osmotic gap, which suggests an unmeasured osmotically active intraluminal substance. The fecal osmotic gap can be calculated as follows: 290 – (2 × [stool sodium + stool potassium]). In this patient, the fecal osmotic gap is: 290 – (2 × [85 + 4.5]) = 111 mOsm/kg. An osmotic gap of greater than 100 mOsm/kg suggests an unmeasured osmotically active substance. Such substances include malabsorbed carbohydrates (e.g., lactose or fructose) and sorbitol. The latter is an artificial sweetener commonly found in sugar-free gum. Treatment of osmotic diarrhea requires avoiding offending agents, such as following a low–fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) and a lactose-free diet."

") can cause secretory diarrhea. This condition can develop after cholecystectomy or after partial ileal resection because of incomplete enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids. This form of diarrhea can be treated with a bile salt binder, such as cholestyramine. Secretory diarrhea due to bile acid excess results in an osmotic gap less than 50 mOsm/kg; given this patient's gap of 111 mOsm/kg, this cause is unlikely."
