"), indicating a reticulocyte response. Hemolysis occurs in patients with G6PD deficiency when exposed to an oxidative stress, most commonly medications. The diagnosis is confirmed by a low G6PD level, although testing performed immediately after a hemolytic episode may be falsely negative, as many of the G6PD-deficient cells were hemolyzed. Repeat testing after recovery may be necessary."
