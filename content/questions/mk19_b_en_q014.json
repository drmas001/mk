"). Thyroid scintigraphy with radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) can verify the cause. Additional testing can be done when the clinical diagnosis is unclear; when RAIU is unavailable or unreliable, such as in patients taking amiodarone or lithium or those recently exposed to iodinated contrast material; or when scintigraphy is contraindicated, such as in pregnancy and lactation. In the absence of RAIU, additional tests include measurement of TSI or thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb). In this patient, TSI measurement is a reasonable first test because an abnormal result has prognostic and treatment implications. Other possible causes of the patient's hyperthyroidism include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis. Because hCG stimulates thyroid hormone secretion, TSH may be mildly suppressed as a result. Serum TSH gradually returns to the nonpregnant reference range in the second and third trimester. Determining the cause of hyperthyroidism is important because transient causes of pregnancy-related hyperthyroidism, such as hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis, may not require intervention other than laboratory monitoring."
