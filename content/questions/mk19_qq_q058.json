"). Mammography is the initial test performed in most patients aged 30 years or older with a breast mass. For patients with a focal abnormality noted on clinical examination or mammogram, targeted ultrasonography can clarify the size of the mass, determine whether the mass is solid or cystic, and identify the margins as smooth or irregular. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial method of evaluation for women younger than 30 years, in whom mammography has low sensitivity due to dense breasts. It is also the test of choice in pregnant patients. Approximately 10% to 20% of palpable breast cancers are not detected by mammography or ultrasonography. Negative ultrasound or a normal mammogram in a patient with a discrete breast mass does not rule out malignancy; therefore, this patient requires further evaluation to characterize the nature of the breast mass. Core needle biopsy, with ultrasonographic or stereotactic guidance (when detectable on imaging), provides excellent tissue sampling for pathology, and if malignant, for hormone receptor status. It is the test of choice for most palpable, solid lesions. This patient with a palpable, firm breast mass but negative imaging results should undergo palpation-guided core needle biopsy."
