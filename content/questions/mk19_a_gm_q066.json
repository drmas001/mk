"An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with fever, confusion, and productive cough. He has COPD. A chest radiograph shows left lower lobe consolidation. The emergency department has been simultaneously involved in caring for several patients critically injured in a motor vehicle accident. The emergency department team provides nebulizer treatment and intravenous glucocorticoids to the patient. Admission to the hospital for COPD exacerbation is recommended. The hospitalist team is notified of the admission but is interrupted by the activation of a rapid response team for another patient. The inpatient nurse team is not notified of this patient admission. Several hours later, the patient is found in his hospital room unresponsive with agonal breathing and hypotension."

"). Diagnostic error is often defined as diagnoses that are delayed, wrong, or missed. Diagnostic errors are usually multifactorial in cause; flaws in the individual clinician's cognitive processes and systems-level issues contribute to most errors. Systems factors that contribute to diagnostic error include communication policies and practices, resource availability, and practice structure. Productivity pressures and administrative burden and their effect on clinician time with patients may also contribute to diagnostic errors. Chaos in a medical practice is associated with an increased risk for error and missed opportunities to provide appropriate care. In this case, the patient has COPD and pneumonia, but he did not receive treatment for his pneumonia, which resulted in an adverse outcome. Cognitive error, multiple competing demands with insufficient resources to accommodate need, possible lack of communication during transitions of care, and chaos may have all contributed to this diagnostic error."
