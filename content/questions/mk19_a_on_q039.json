"). M0 castrate-resistant prostate cancer occurs when the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level rises without evidence of clinical metastatic disease in men being treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This condition does not always require treatment, as in men with a very slowly rising PSA level because it can take years before there is development of clinical metastatic disease. However, in a patient with a rapidly rising PSA level (e.g., doubling time ≤10 months), treatment is indicated, as development of clinical metastatic disease typically occurs much sooner. Treatment with androgen receptor blockers improves overall survival in this patient population. A large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial study concluded that apalutamide improved median metastasis-free survival from 16.2 months to 40.5 months. Apalutamide and enzalutamide are both standard treatments for this patient population."
