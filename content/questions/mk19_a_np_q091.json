"). Dipstick measurements of protein are dependent on urine concentration; false-negative results may be caused by dilute urine, and false-positive results may be caused by highly concentrated urine. Because moderately increased albuminuria may go undetected by dipstick urinalysis, direct quantification is required in high-risk patients. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline recommends a BP goal of <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes mellitus. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends a BP target of <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes and hypertension at higher cardiovascular risk (existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] or 10-year ASCVD event risk ≥15%), if it can be safely attained. For patients who have diabetes and hypertension with a 10-year ASCVD <15%, the ADA recommends a target of 140/90 mm Hg. According to the ACC/AHA, ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be considered in the presence of albuminuria. For patients with hypertension, diabetes, and urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g, the ADA recommends an ACE inhibitor or ARB at the maximum tolerated dose as first-line treatment; such treatment should also be considered if urine albumin-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g to 300 mg/g. Consequently, the next step in management of this patient is to measure her urine albumin-creatinine ratio to determine if an ACE inhibitor or ARB is indicated."
