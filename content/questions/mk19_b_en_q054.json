") level. It affects 5% to 10% of the general population. Transient elevation of serum TSH should be ruled out by repeating the measurement in 6 to 8 weeks. The rate of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism is 2% to 4% per year, whereas normal thyroid function will spontaneously return in one third of patients. The normal range for TSH increases with age; a TSH level of up to 10 μU/mL (10 mU/L) is within the normal range for persons 80 years and older."

This patient fulfills none of these criteria. Subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH greater than 10 μU/mL (10 mU/L) may be a risk factor for coronary artery disease and heart failure. There is no evidence that treating subclinical hypothyroidism improves quality of life, cognitive function, blood pressure, or weight; however, in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol, normalizing the TSH will lower LDL cholesterol. Overtreatment, however, is seen in more than one third of patients older than 65 years, which may increase risk for dysrhythmia and bone loss."
