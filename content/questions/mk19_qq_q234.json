") are the most appropriate next step in management. Diabetic retinopathy is a well-recognized microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus and is one of the leading causes of visual loss in adults in the United States. Diabetic retinopathy is classified as nonproliferative (with hard exudates, microaneurysms, and minor hemorrhages), which is not associated with visual decline, or as proliferative (with “cotton-wool spots” and neovascularization), which is associated with loss of vision. Changes in retinal blood flow occur after several years of diabetes. These changes cause retinal ischemia, which in turn promotes growth factors that stimulate proliferation of new blood vessels. This process leads to scarring and fibrosis. Fibrous tissue can put traction on the retina, which may cause retinal detachment with resultant vision loss. New vessels may also become more permeable and leak serum, which causes macular edema. Tight glycemic control, lipid lowering, and blood pressure reduction have been shown to decrease the incidence and progression of retinopathy. Once proliferative retinopathy is established, vision can be preserved by appropriately timed laser photocoagulation. Intraocular injection of an anti-VEGF agent (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept) has also been shown to be an effective treatment. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents provide a more effective treatment regimen for central-involved diabetic macular edema than monotherapy or even combination therapy with laser photocoagulation, and they are the preferred therapy."
