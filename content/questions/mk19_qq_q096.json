"Cardiogenic shock is a common complication of STEMI. It typically results from a large anterior myocardial infarction due to severely reduced left ventricular systolic function. Patients with cardiogenic shock, particularly those younger than 75 years, have a higher rate of survival if they receive emergent revascularization. In these cases, an intra-aortic balloon pump (",

") or left ventricular assist device may be implanted temporarily, although limited data support their benefits in cardiogenic shock. Low blood pressure alone should not be considered diagnostic of end-organ hypoperfusion. Instead, blood pressure should be considered in the context of other physical examination findings that may suggest end-organ hypoperfusion (cool clammy skin, altered mentation, low urine output). This patient has no indication for intra-aortic balloon pump."

Patients best suited for thrombolytic therapy are those who present early after symptom onset and with low bleeding risk; however, PCI is always preferred if the patient is in a PCI-capable facility and the procedure is performed as soon as possible or if the patient can be transferred from an index hospital to a PCI-capable center quickly (time from first medical contact to primary PCI of 120 minutes or less)."
