"). Iron deficiency may result from blood loss or malabsorption in addition to increased iron requirements. Women of reproductive age may lose enough iron through normal menstrual blood loss to become iron deficient in the absence of uterine or gastrointestinal disease. This patient has iron deficiency that is probably a result of menstrual blood loss. For simple iron deficiency, oral ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and simplest treatment option and is therefore the most appropriate. Several ferrous preparations available over the counter are probably as effective. New data show that every-other-day dosing of oral iron is more effective than daily dosing."

"Parenteral iron is reserved for patients receiving dialysis or for those who have absorption problems (e.g., patients who have had gastric bypass surgery) or an intolerance to oral iron replacement.

"A low mean corpuscular volume, elevated red cell distribution width, and peripheral blood smear showing microcytosis and anisopoikilocytosis are virtually diagnostic of iron deficiency, especially in premenopausal women; these findings may obviate the need for additional laboratory testing, including serum ferritin measurement (",

"), provided that a follow-up complete blood count is performed to assess response to iron therapy. A low serum iron level, elevated total iron-binding capacity, low transferrin saturation (>15%; iron/total iron-binding capacity × 100), and a serum ferritin level less than 14 ng/mL (14 μg/L) confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency. The ferritin value is highly specific (99%) but has a low sensitivity (59%), resulting in potentially false-negative results and missed diagnosis of iron deficiency."
