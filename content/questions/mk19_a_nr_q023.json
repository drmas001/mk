Two weeks ago, she sustained a mild traumatic brain injury in a head-to-head collision during a match and, for the next 3 days, had episodic dizziness and recurrent headaches lasting minutes to hours; symptoms resolved spontaneously with a combination of physical and cognitive rest. She resumed normal activities and has been free of symptoms for the past 10 days. She has taken no medication. Neuroimaging was not performed at the time of injury."

"). The terms mild TBI and concussion are often used interchangeably. Concussion has been defined as a clinical syndrome of biomechanically induced alteration of brain function. Altered brain function is most commonly described by affected subjects as being confused or dazed, with 10% reporting transient loss of consciousness. Next to accidents, sporting activities represent the second most common source of TBI in young adults. In men, football and hockey result in most cases of mild TBI, whereas in women, the most common cause is soccer. When TBI is suspected, athletes must be immediately removed from play and subjected to standardized sideline assessment tools. Guidelines recommend continued avoidance of contact sports until 10 days after the trauma or until the patient has been asymptomatic while taking no medication for a period of 7 days. This patient meets both time-based criteria, is asymptomatic with normal findings on neurologic examination, and may be cleared to return to play."
