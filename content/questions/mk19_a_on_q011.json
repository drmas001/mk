"). Patients with testicular cancer most commonly present with swelling or a solid testicular mass. Although pain is commonly present, not all patients report it. Keeping this diagnosis in mind is important even in men who present with testicular pain without a clearly evident mass. Initial evaluation is typically made with scrotal ultrasound. Cancers are characteristically solid, so cystic masses are rarely indicative of cancer. Seminoma and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors have different ultrasound characteristics, but identification of any solid mass contained within the testicle should prompt further evaluation for cancer. Other studies commonly performed are serum tumor markers and other imaging studies, such as CT of the abdomen and pelvis and chest radiograph. In patients who have findings consistent with a possible diagnosis of testicular cancer, resection by radical inguinal orchiectomy is indicated. This step is both diagnostic and therapeutic, as it provides important local tumor control."

"Tumors with elevated α-fetoprotein levels are classified as nonseminomatous germ cell tumors.

"). Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in patients with nodal involvement on RPLND. Persistence of tumor marker elevation after orchiectomy without abnormal imaging findings is also an indication for chemotherapy. Staging includes evaluation with chest radiography, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and tumor marker levels after orchiectomy. Because the staging process has not been completed, chemotherapy is not indicated."
