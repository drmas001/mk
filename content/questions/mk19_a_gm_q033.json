"). Patients are presumed to be legally competent to make medical decisions for themselves unless determined to be incompetent by the court. However, in routine clinical care, physicians must frequently determine a patient's decision-making capacity, including the patient's ability to understand relevant information; consider treatment options; appreciate the potential medical consequences of their decision; and communicate a choice, preferably a choice that is stable over time. Unlike competence, which is a global determination, decision-making capacity needs to be evaluated for each decision to be made. In this instance, the patient's capacity to refuse blood products needs to be evaluated before any transfusion. Her mental health disorder does not automatically invalidate her capacity, and her refusal of blood products, if consistent with previously expressed religious beliefs, makes her decision more valid."
