Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is usually but not always superimposed. Biventricular heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, erythrocytosis, and volume overload are common. Weight loss is essential, and consideration can be given to bariatric surgery. Positive airway pressure therapy is indicated. Although definitive trials comparing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) are not available, the most recent guideline recommends CPAP as initial therapy for overlapping OSA and obesity hypoventilation, though BPAP might be warranted for those without coexisting OSA. Supplemental oxygen may need to be added and reassessed at a later date."

Although hypercapnia defines OHS, such a finding is unusual in DPLD until the disease reaches a very advanced stage. The combined absence of cough and hypercapnia along with the normal chest radiograph argue against the diagnosis of DPLD."
