"). Walking and ankle flexion exercises are inexpensive, safe, and effective treatment for nonulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. These interventions activate the calf-muscle \"venous pump\" to move lower extremity venous blood proximally. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated the benefits of long-term compression therapy in patients with CVI with associated edema, ulcer, or eczema. Before starting compression stockings, patients with weak pulses or risk factors for atherosclerosis should have ankle-brachial index measurements because compression therapy is contraindicated in patients with peripheral artery disease. CVI results from persistent venous hypertension caused by venous incompetence or occlusion. It is commonly seen in older persons, those who are overweight, or those with previous conditions (thrombophlebitis, trauma) in which the lower extremity venous system may have been damaged. Manifestations of CVI include edema, varicose veins, skin hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, cellulitis, and ulceration (such as in this patient, who has a healed ulcer on the right medial ankle). Diagnosis is usually made based on history and examination alone, but duplex ultrasonography can be helpful in unclear cases or when planning surgery. Medications should be reviewed because certain drugs (e.g., dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) can exacerbate dependent edema."

"), can be used in CVI when there is evidence of secondary infection. Because CVI causes lower extremity erythema, it is frequently confused with infection. However, cellulitis is usually acute, erythematous, unilateral, and associated with pain and possibly systemic symptoms. This patient's stable bilateral brown pigmentation without acute changes or signs of infection is more consistent with CVI."

"A topical glucocorticoid, such as hydrocortisone (",

"), is indicated for patients who manifest findings of stasis dermatitis such as erythema, oozing, or vesiculation. Mid-potency topical glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% or hydrocortisone valerate 0.02%, are typically used. This patient has no findings to suggest stasis dermatitis, and topical glucocorticoids are not needed. For dry itching skin, topical petrolatum is recommended."
