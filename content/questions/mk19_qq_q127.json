") for this patient with functional incontinence. Nonpharmacologic behavioral therapy is recommended first-line treatment for urinary incontinence, and behavioral therapy utilizing prompted voiding is the most appropriate management for this patient whose incontinence may be due to her cognitive impairment and decreased mobility. Prompted voiding involves regularly asking the patient to report on incontinence, asking the patient if he or she needs to void, providing assistance with access to the bathroom, and praising the patient for continence. This technique has been shown to reduce urinary incontinence in older patients who have caregivers capable of working with them, including those residing in assisted-care facilities. Prompted voiding should be timed to occur before a large volume of urine has accumulated in the bladder, reducing the likelihood of incontinence. With active and consistent caregiver involvement, prompted urination can help achieve improved bladder control."

Adverse effects are common, however, and include constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, and confusion. Older patients are at greater risk for these effects, and antimuscarinic agents are included on the Beers Criteria list of drugs to avoid in the elderly. Therefore, an antimuscarinic agent would not be an appropriate therapeutic choice in this older patient with cognitive impairment and probable functional incontinence."

Although training is implemented by physical therapists or advanced practice nurses, both pelvic floor muscle and bladder training require intact cognition and the ability to self-manage and self-sustain a training regimen. It is therefore unlikely to be effective in this patient with dementia and is unlikely to improve functional incontinence."
