"). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been studied in patients with diabetes mellitus and in patients with heart failure with or without diabetes. For patients with diabetes, studies have shown a reduction in cardiovascular events, including heart failure–related mortality and hospitalizations, with use of these agents. SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) seem to reduce the risk for heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death by 1.9% and death from any cause by 2.3%, independent of glucose control. The mechanisms of this reduction are unclear but are thought to be independent of increased diuresis due to glucose excretion. The American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, endorsed by the American College of Cardiology, recommends initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce the risk for worsening heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction."

There is no support for its use, however, in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction."
