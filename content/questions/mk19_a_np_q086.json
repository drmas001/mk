Patients are at increased risk due to a relatively immunosuppressed state from chronic inflammation and frequent exposure to the health care environment. Tunneled dialysis catheters increase the risk for bacteremia, and empiric antibiotics should be administered while awaiting blood culture results in patients with suspected bacteremia.
