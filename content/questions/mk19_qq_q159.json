"). Because her venous thromboembolism (VTE) was unprovoked, she is at relatively high risk for recurrence, in the range of 10% in the first year and 5% per year afterward, without anticoagulation. Treatment with full-dose anticoagulation has been shown to decrease this recurrence by about 90%. Based on her history, absence of comorbid conditions, and age, her bleeding risk is low. In addition to risks for recurrence and bleeding, patient preference should also be considered in deciding on long-term anticoagulation. The decision to treat this patient for an extended period is consistent with current guidelines, which suggest extended anticoagulant therapy in patients with unprovoked proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism who have low or moderate bleeding risk. Guidelines also suggest considering reduced-dose anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban or rivaroxaban) when opting for extended anticoagulation therapy. Reevaluation of this indication based on periodic risk/benefit assessments, new clinical study data, and new anticoagulation drug availability is appropriate."

"). In this patient with an unprovoked proximal DVT, the recommendation for long-term anticoagulation would not be altered by the results of such testing; thus, it would not be helpful. Testing may be indicated, however, in patients with VTE at intermediate risk for recurrence by traditional predictors, in whom finding a strong thrombophilic risk might alter therapeutic decisions. Finally, some tests for thrombophilia are inaccurate in patients receiving anticoagulation treatment, so these studies should be performed when the patient is not taking anticoagulants."
