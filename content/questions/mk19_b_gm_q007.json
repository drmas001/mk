"). This patient has received appropriate screening for hypertension at a routine wellness examination. She has no signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease and her blood pressure at this visit is in the high-normal range, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The USPSTF supports screening all adults beginning at age 18 years for hypertension (grade A). Screening should occur annually in adults aged 40 years or older and in younger adults at increased risk. On the basis of this patient's blood pressure reading today (129/78 mm Hg) and her having obesity (BMI of 30), she should have repeated blood pressure measurement annually. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure guideline recommends repeated annual blood pressure measurement for adults with a normal pressure reading."

Before treatment is initiated, when possible and in the absence of severe hypertension or end-organ damage, the diagnosis should be confirmed with blood pressure measurements outside of the clinical setting by using ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring. This patient with high-normal blood pressure reading can be reassessed in 1 year without initiating treatment."

Echocardiography is not indicated in this patient with normal physical examination findings and a high-normal blood pressure."
