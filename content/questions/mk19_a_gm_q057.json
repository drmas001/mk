Spinal imaging for acute back pain should be limited to patients with “red flags” suggesting an underlying process that requires intervention, such as a personal history of cancer or symptoms concerning for cancer (fever, persistent pain, vertebral tenderness, or weight loss) or cauda equina syndrome (bowel or bladder dysfunction, persistent or increasing lower motor neuron weakness, or saddle anesthesia). In this case, the patient's injection drug use and focal vertebral tenderness should heighten suspicion for an acute infection of the spine, such as epidural abscess, diskitis, or osteomyelitis. MRI is considered the gold standard in patients with suspected spinal infection, cancer, cord compression, or cauda equina syndrome."
