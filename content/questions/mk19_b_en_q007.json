"). This patient is premenopausal and has new-onset hyperandrogenism; therefore, both ovarian and adrenal sources of androgen excess should be considered. This combination of a markedly elevated serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) level and mildly elevated serum testosterone level suggests an adrenal source, given that the adrenal glands are the major source of DHEAS. An abdominal CT is recommended when the serum DHEAS value is greater than 700 μg/dL (19.0 μmol/L). Androgen-producing adrenal tumors are rare and lead to menstrual irregularities and virilization in women, including hirsutism, voice-deepening, increased muscle mass, increased libido, and clitoromegaly."
