"A 36-year-old woman is evaluated during a routine wellness visit. She is asymptomatic and has no medical problems. She works as an accountant and rarely engages in physical activity. She drinks a glass of red wine with dinner five times weekly. Her diet is rich in protein and starches and low in fruits, vegetables, and nuts. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 5 years. Her mother has rheumatoid arthritis, and the patient is concerned that she might also develop the disease. Her only medication is a combined oral contraceptive."

"). One of the most provocative environmental factors for the development of rheumatoid arthritis is smoking. A dose-dependent relationship exists between smoking and the development of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Smoking can lead to lung inflammation, which activates such enzymes as peptidylarginine deiminase, which deaminates arginine to form citrullinated peptides. HLA-D alleles code for the shared epitope. The shared epitope, a five–amino acid sequence, preferentially binds and presents citrullinated peptide antigens. This leads to the production of anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies that could initiate inflammation by fixing complement in the tissues. Patients who smoke are at increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those with a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, and should be counseled about smoking cessation. The risk for RA increases with an increasing number of smoking pack-years, and the risk decreases as the interval of smoking cessation increases. Combining behavioral counseling with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either modality alone in achieving long-term smoking abstinence."
