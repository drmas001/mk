"). This patient has heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is characterized by symptoms of heart failure in the setting of normal systolic function and no valvular abnormalities. This patient with HFpEF was appropriately treated with a loop diuretic to control symptoms of volume overload. She now needs an additional antihypertensive agent to attain a target systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg. Adding losartan for better hypertension control is appropriate at this time. Neurohormonal blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in HFpEF is beneficial in reducing sodium and water retention and ameliorating adverse cardiac remodeling."
