"). Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is acute, measurable airway obstruction that occurs in response to exercise. It is one of the most common triggers of symptoms in patients with known asthma. It also occurs in patients without asthma (typically, elite athletes) during periods of high-intensity exercise. Environmental factors such as cold, dry air, exposure to high levels of trichloramines in swimming pools, and inhalation of airborne particulates and ozone can play a key role in precipitating symptoms. For safety, current Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines no longer recommend treatment of intermittent asthma, including EIB, with a short-acting β",

"-agonist (SABA) alone. All adults should receive a glucocorticoid-containing controller treatment to reduce their risk of serious exacerbations and to control symptoms. The glucocorticoid controller medication can be administered either as regular daily treatment or, in milder asthma, as the combination glucocorticoid-formoterol taken whenever needed for asthma relief. Accordingly, GINA guidelines recommend a daily inhaled glucocorticoid plus a SABA before exercise or low-dose budesonide-formoterol before exercise. Nonpharmacologic measures, including pre-exercise warm-up and warming cold air before inhalation (e.g., with a mask or scarf), are also recommended. In contrast, the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has continued the previous recommendation of as-needed SABA-only use for this group of patients."
