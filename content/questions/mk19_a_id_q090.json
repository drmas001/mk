" species. Infection is acute and rapidly fatal, even with early diagnosis and treatment. Major blood vessels are invaded, with ensuing ischemia, necrosis, and infarction of adjacent tissues. Mucormycosis has five major clinical forms: (1) rhinocerebral; (2) pulmonary; (3) abdominal, pelvic, gastric, gastrointestinal; (4) primary cutaneous; and (5) disseminated. The presence of oral necrotic lesions strongly indicates an invasive mucor infection in this patient. This patient has left eye proptosis, with accompanying ptosis of the upper lid, and generalized palpebral swelling and erythema, and left facial drooping. Signs of orbital infection include periorbital edema, proptosis, and blindness. Spread from the sphenoid sinuses to the adjacent cavernous sinus can result in cranial nerve palsies (cranial nerve VII in this case), sinus thrombosis, and carotid artery involvement. Definitive diagnosis frequently requires a biopsy with histopathologic examination, which is the most sensitive form of diagnosis. Treatment requires reversal of any predisposing condition, extensive surgical removal of affected tissue, and early antifungal therapy. Initial treatment is high-dose liposomal amphotericin B, with later de-escalation to posaconazole or isavuconazonium sulfate."
