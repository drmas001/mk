His clinical picture is consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is diagnosed by an absolute increase in mature lymphocytes (>5000/µL) sustained for 3 months and demonstration of clonality of the circulating B-lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Immunophenotyping will show a monoclonal proliferation of mature B-lymphocytes expressing CD19, CD20, CD23, and CD5. CLL is the most common leukemia, and its incidence increases with age. Most patients are asymptomatic, with early-stage disease discovered incidentally during routine laboratory testing. The natural history of CLL is highly variable, and multiple prognostic models are used, including clinical signs and symptoms, β",
