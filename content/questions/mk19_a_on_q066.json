"). This patient, who presents with a painless, rapidly developing, partially cystic neck mass, should be considered to have squamous cell carcinoma until proven otherwise. Based on this patient's presentation, the most appropriate initial management is FNA. FNA is very accurate for diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and is preferred over more invasive biopsy techniques. It has a diagnostic accuracy of 88% to 89% and can be done rapidly in the office with limited or no morbidity. A more invasive form of biopsy would only be needed if FNA results were nondiagnostic. If found to be squamous cell carcinoma, this cancer should also be evaluated for human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, as this patient is in the appropriate age range for HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma, and a largely cystic mass on CT imaging is characteristic for this infection-related cancer. HPV-related cancers occur most commonly between ages 40 to 59 years. Although HPV status does not have an impact on treatment decisions, it is associated with an improved prognosis."

PET/CT is not indicated before a diagnosis of cancer, and the results of a PET/CT scan would not change the need to biopsy this mass. Although this mass would be expected to have increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, some largely cystic metastatic nodes are not very avid on PET/CT, raising risk of a false-negative finding."
