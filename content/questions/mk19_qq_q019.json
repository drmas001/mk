Erythrodermic psoriasis is a severe, potentially fatal inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by widespread erythema (early), scaling and exfoliation (later), and sheets of superficial pustules with erosions in about 30% of patients. In people with preexisting psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis may be precipitated by withdrawal of oral glucocorticoids (or excessive use of topical glucocorticoids). Management includes hospitalization for supportive care and possibly nonglucocorticoid systemic immunomodulators. This patient has features characteristic of erythrodermic psoriasis, including a history of psoriasis, recent withdrawal of an oral glucocorticoid, extensive erythroderma, and fever."
