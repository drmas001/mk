"). This patient's presenting symptom of acute anterior chest pain suggests acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection. In this patient, aortic dissection is most likely because of the significant differences in systolic blood pressures between the right and left arms. In addition, the grade 3/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left sternal border indicates the presence of aortic regurgitation (AR). In the setting of suspected aortic dissection, the presence of new or worsened AR suggests aortic root involvement, which constitutes a surgical emergency. Transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is indicated to confirm the presence, severity, and etiology of acute AR. CT angiography is indicated in patients with acute aortic dissection because it is highly accurate and rapidly available. TEE may be used when CT imaging is unavailable and is helpful in assessment of aortic valve function before and after the surgical intervention."

"). However, aortic dissection is a much more likely diagnosis based on the presence of blood pressure discrepancy in the arms, AR murmur, nondiagnostic ECG findings, and indeterminate troponin measurement. Cardiac catheterization is relatively contraindicated in acute aortic dissection because of the possibility of propagating the dissection. Furthermore, coronary artery catheterization will not address aortic dissection. Thus, if aortic dissection is being considered, CT angiography is preferred to coronary artery catheterization."
