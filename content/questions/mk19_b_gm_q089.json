Patients with epiglottitis may present with findings of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, severe sore throat, drooling that suggests difficulty managing normal secretions, stridor, and inability to open the mouth. Although adults with acute epiglottitis are less likely than children to progress to airway obstruction, if acute epiglottitis is suspected and airway obstruction is a consideration, airway management is a priority. Patients rarely require intubation or tracheostomy; however, hospital admission is recommended, often to an ICU setting and with surgical consultation, to ensure close monitoring of the airway. Parenteral antibiotic therapy directed toward common respiratory pathogens is additionally indicated. Typical choices for empiric therapy include ceftriaxone or cefotaxime and vancomycin."
