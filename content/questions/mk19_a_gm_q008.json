") is the most appropriate treatment. In patients with severe COPD, dyspnea is a common problem that requires a multimodal approach to management. Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most effective interventions to improve dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients with severe COPD. Specifically, pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to improve fatigue, emotional function, dyspnea, and 6-minute walk distance. In addition, noninvasive measures, such as pursed lip breathing and use of a handheld fan, can improve dyspnea in patients already using maximal medical therapy. Studies of guided relaxation training and acupuncture/acupressure have yielded mixed results, but these therapies are safe and may be reasonable to consider for patients with refractory dyspnea."

") and other macrolide antibiotics have been studied in COPD and may be an important adjunctive medical therapy in selected populations. In patients with moderate or severe COPD who experience frequent COPD exacerbations (more than two exacerbations per year), azithromycin given daily or three times weekly can reduce the frequency of exacerbations and sometimes positively affect quality of life. Risks associated with macrolide use include reduced hearing and antibiotic resistance. This patient is not a good candidate for macrolide therapy because it would not be expected to improve his dyspnea in the absence of frequent COPD exacerbations."

Data from a randomized controlled trial of palliative oxygen versus medical air in normoxic patients demonstrated no improvement in quality of life or subjective dyspnea scores with palliative oxygen therapy, supporting the hypothesis that movement of air is more important in reducing breathlessness in these patients. This patient is normoxic, and continuous oxygen therapy is not indicated at this time."
