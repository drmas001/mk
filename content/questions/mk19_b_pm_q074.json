"). A sleep study showed that this patient has central sleep apnea (CSA). CSA is defined by pauses in airflow due to loss of output from the central respiratory generators in the brainstem to the respiratory muscles, resulting in lack of respiratory effort. There are few clinical trials proving a role for specific treatment of CSA, so initial management should target modifiable risk factors. For example, reduction or elimination of opioids improves CSA. Medical optimization of heart failure (with drugs or devices, optimizing fluid balance in the setting of volume overload, or surgery such as valve repair or cardiac transplantation) has been shown to improve CSA. This patient's CSA is most likely related to use of opioid analgesics. Because initial management of CSA should target modifiable risk factors, a pain rehabilitation program to help the patient curtail opioid use is appropriate. Additionally, a more appropriate long-term pain management strategy is needed to improve her quality of life. However, adherence to a pain management plan that includes opioid reduction may be difficult and failure is frequent."

") is a form of positive airway pressure therapy that effectively suppresses CSA. Small observational studies suggest that it has some efficacy in opioid-induced CSA, but controlled trials are lacking to demonstrate improvements in important outcomes. Although a trial of ASV may be warranted in some patients with opioid-related CSA, it should be preceded by an attempt to reduce opioid use and to try other treatments with proven efficacy and safety. Consideration should also be given to an increased risk of death associated with ASV treatment in a large trial of patients with heart failure defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%."

In fact, when CPAP is used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, it can occasionally result in CSA (a condition called treatment-emergent central sleep apnea). CPAP may be appropriate in some patients with combined CSA and OSA, as determined by polysomnography."
