") should be measured. Her total calcium level is elevated, but she is without symptoms of hypercalcemia. Approximately 40% to 45% of the calcium in serum is bound to protein, principally albumin, although the physiologically active form of calcium is in an ionized (or free) state. In most patients with relatively normal serum albumin levels, the total calcium usually reflects an accurate ionized calcium fraction. However, in clinical settings in which increased protein binding of calcium may occur, the serum total calcium level may be elevated without a rise in the actual serum ionized calcium concentration. This may occur in patients with hyperalbuminuria (as may occur in those who are severely dehydrated) and in patients with a paraprotein capable of binding calcium (as occasionally occurs in some patients with multiple myeloma). This phenomenon is sometimes termed pseudohypercalcemia (or factitious hypercalcemia). If present, a normal ionized calcium level may indicate that the elevated total calcium level is the result of excessive protein binding and potentially eliminates the need for further evaluation for hypercalcemia. Ionized calcium measurement is indicated in asymptomatic patients with multiple myeloma and elevated total serum calcium."
