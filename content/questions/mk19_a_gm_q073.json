The FDA recommends confirmation with clinical testing before DTC test results are used in patient care. Clinical genetic testing is indicated for patients with a personal or family history suggesting inherited cancer susceptibility; however, patients should undergo genetic counseling first to guide decision making. The basic components of genetic counseling are education on the condition being tested, including the natural history, possible treatments, and preventive measures; the risks and benefits of testing; alternatives to testing, including the option to forgo testing; the implications for the patient and family members; and costs, including the possibility of denial of coverage for disability, long-term care, and life insurance."
