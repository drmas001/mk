") is the most appropriate diagnostic test. Symptoms of progressive dyspnea may be caused by underlying pulmonary or cardiac disorders, but this patient's physical findings, including a significant pulsus paradoxus (24 mm Hg), tachycardia, distant heart sounds, and crackles, as well as an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiograph, suggest the life-threatening diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Pulsus paradoxus represents exaggerated ventricular interdependence and is a key clinical feature of cardiac tamponade. It is characterized by a fall in systolic pressure of greater than 10 mm Hg during inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus is not specific for tamponade and must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and echocardiographic features. If the fluid has accumulated slowly, the cardiac silhouette is typically enlarged on chest radiograph. This patient's findings should prompt urgent evaluation for cardiac tamponade and treatment if present. Echocardiography to evaluate for the presence, distribution, and relative volume of pericardial fluid is important to establish the diagnosis."
