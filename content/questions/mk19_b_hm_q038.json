"). In patients with thalassemia, iron overload–related heart failure and/or arrhythmias are the major cause of death. Baseline iron studies should be obtained, and serial measurements of serum ferritin can monitor iron stores, particularly if transfusion requirements increase. In addition to standard cardiac assessment with electrocardiography and echocardiography, MRI is used to monitor cardiac and hepatic iron stores. This patient has many of the manifestations of β-thalassemia, including anemia, extramedullary hematopoiesis, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow space expansion with characteristic skeletal changes. Patients often remain transfusion independent during childhood and young adulthood but require transfusions beginning in the third and fourth decades of life. Heightened gastrointestinal absorption of iron that accompanies ineffective erythropoiesis adds to the transfusion-related iron overload. Excess iron deposition in the organs can lead to arrhythmia and heart failure, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and endocrinopathies (diabetes, hypopituitarism, hypogonadism). Patients should avoid iron supplementation, and transfusions should be performed judiciously. Patients with secondary iron overload require chelation therapy with parenteral desferrioxamine or oral iron chelators (deferasirox or deferiprone) before the onset of end-organ damage."
