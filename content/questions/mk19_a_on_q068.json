"). Men treated with radiation therapy rarely achieve an undetectable PSA, as is commonly seen after surgery. Rather, the PSA will fall with treatment and reach a nadir. PSA-only recurrence is defined as an increase in the PSA level by at least 2 ng/mL (2 µg/L) above the postradiation therapy nadir. This patient had a nadir PSA of approximately 1 ng/mL (1 µg/L) and now has a PSA of 3.2 ng/mL (3.2 µg/L) 9 years after treatment. Imaging studies did not reveal any evidence of metastatic disease. Therefore, he has a PSA-only recurrence. Treatment for patients with PSA-only recurrence is informed by the degree of PSA elevation and the rate of rise in the PSA level. For men with a rapid doubling time, defined as 10 months or less, treatment is generally recommended. Standard treatment in this setting is an androgen receptor blocker (such as enzalutamide). Men with a slow PSA doubling time (for example, more than 10 months) do not require immediate treatment, however, as it can take years for them to develop clinical metastatic disease. They can be monitored with serial PSA assessment, and treatment can be deferred."
