Three pneumococcal vaccines are available: the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15), the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20), and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). In adults aged 19 to 64 years with CKD, pneumococcal vaccination with either PCV20 or both PCV15 and PPSV23 is indicated. If PCV15 and PPSV23 are administered, PCV15 should be administered first followed by PPSV23 (",
