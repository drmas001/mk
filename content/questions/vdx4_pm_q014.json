"A pneumothorax would present with a loss of “lung sliding,” which is the to-and-fro movement of the visceral pleura on the parietal pleura seen with respiration. Pneumonia is typically identified on ultrasonography by regions of lung that have a consolidated tissue-like appearance similar to the liver (“hepatization” of the lung). Often these regions are surrounded by focal B lines, an artifact generated by differences in density of the lung parenchyma resulting from increased fluid content. Neither is seen in this study. Pulmonary fibrosis on lung ultrasonography would appear as a thickened, irregular pleural line in addition to a diffuse B-line pattern."
