"). Before considering other diagnoses, a pregnancy test should be obtained for all women of reproductive age, including women using contraception, who present with acute pelvic pain to assess the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy. Although the use of an intrauterine device (IUD) does not increase the risk for ectopic pregnancy, it is the form of failed contraception most associated with ectopic pregnancy. If a woman with acute pelvic pain does have a positive pregnancy test result, quantitative β-human chorionic gonadotropin, type and screen, and transvaginal ultrasonography should be obtained immediately, along with consultation with an obstetrician/gynecologist. Women with ectopic pregnancies may undergo surgical management or medical management with methotrexate, as directed by an obstetrician/gynecologist."

") may be appropriate in the assessment of acute pelvic pain, particularly if the clinical picture is suggestive of appendicitis, but only after obtaining a negative pregnancy test result. However, CT is a second-line test in the evaluation of acute pelvic pain because ultrasonography provides better visualization to assess the likelihood of ovarian torsion and other pelvic pathology. Although this patient has right lower quadrant pain, which is concerning for appendicitis, she has no other findings, such as nausea, vomiting, or leukocytosis, to suggest the diagnosis."
