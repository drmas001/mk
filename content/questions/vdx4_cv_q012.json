"The most likely diagnosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as cardiac amyloidosis. This ECG demonstrates low voltage with QRS amplitude of less than 5 mm in the limb leads. Low voltage may also be demonstrated by a QRS amplitude of less than 10 mm in the precordial leads. When low ECG voltage accompanies increased wall thickness on echocardiogram, an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as amyloidosis, should be considered. Serum protein electrophoresis/urine protein electrophoresis and free light-chain analysis may help identify immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis."
