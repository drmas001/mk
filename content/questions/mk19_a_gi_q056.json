"), also called transfer dysphagia. Swallowing has three phases: oral phase (food bolus forms and transfers to the back of the throat), pharyngeal phase (bolus is safely positioned in the upper throat, the soft palate elevates, the epiglottis protects the trachea, the tongue moves backward, and the pharyngeal wall moves forward), and esophageal phase (bolus enters the esophagus with relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter). When the first two phases fail to position a bolus in the throat for entry into the esophagus, choking, coughing, and nasal regurgitation of solids and liquids may occur. These symptoms pose a risk for aspiration pneumonia. Other presenting symptoms may include hoarseness (resulting from laryngeal nerve damage) and dysarthria (from weakness of the soft palate or pharyngeal constrictors), both suggesting an underlying neurologic disorder. Indeed, oropharyngeal dysphagia may be an early symptom or presenting sign of neurologic disorders, such as Parkinson disease and stroke. It is important to recognize oropharyngeal dysphagia by history because the initial recommended study is a modified barium swallow (with a range of liquid and solid consistencies) and videofluoroscopy. Endoscopy and esophageal manometry have a limited role in the evaluation of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Management consists of dietary changes and a swallowing exercise program."
