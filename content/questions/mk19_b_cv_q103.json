She has no family history of sudden cardiac death. Her only medication is metoprolol."

") is the most appropriate treatment. Any unexplained episode of syncope in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents a potential arrhythmic event and requires further risk stratification, including echocardiography and ambulatory ECG monitoring for arrhythmia. The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy recommends ICD placement for patients with HCM and previous documented cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia (class 1 recommendation). For adult patients with HCM and one or more major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD), offering an ICD is reasonable (class 2a recommendation). Risk factors include SCD judged definitively or likely attributable to HCM in one or more first-degree or close relatives aged 50 years or younger, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of 30 mm or greater in any LV segment, one or more recent episodes of syncope suspected by clinical history to be arrhythmic in nature, LV apical aneurysm, and LV ejection fraction less than 50%. Based on the patient's recent episode of unexplained syncope and LV wall thickness of 30 mm, it is reasonable to refer her for consideration of an ICD to prevent SCD."

"For patients with HCM and symptoms attributable to LV outflow tract obstruction, nonvasodilating β-blockers are recommended. Such symptoms typically include effort-related dyspnea or chest pain. If β-blockers are ineffective or not tolerated, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (verapamil or diltiazem) may be substituted. If symptoms persist despite β-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker therapy, adding disopyramide in combination with one of the other drugs or treatment with septal reduction therapy (SRT) is recommended. This patient's obstructive symptoms generally have been well managed on metoprolol, and her outflow tract gradient on echocardiography does not indicate severe LV outflow tract obstruction; thus, changing this patient's medications (",
