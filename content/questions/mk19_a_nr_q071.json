"). This patient most likely has juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). In adults, JME is the most common form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. JME seizures often are called “college seizures” because of the age of onset (teens or twenties) and associated triggers (sleep deprivation, alcohol use, and stress). Epilepsy may not be diagnosed until the first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) occurs because myoclonic seizures often remain unrecognized. The presence of myoclonic seizures is required for the diagnosis of JME; patients may report dropping items from their hands, commonly a coffee cup or hairbrush, because myoclonic seizures in JME generally occur in the morning. Most affected patients have GTCSs, and approximately 30% of patients have absence seizures. Seizures are often controlled with one or two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Lifelong AED therapy is typically required. Because she is planning a pregnancy, lamotrigine and levetiracetam are the preferred treatment options and are considered among the safest seizure medications from a teratogenicity standpoint and for general, long-term safety. However, since lamotrigine has been reported to worsen myoclonic seizures in some patients, levetiracetam may be preferred."
