"). Aortic valve replacement is a life-prolonging procedure in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The indications for aortic valve replacement in severe aortic stenosis are (1) the presence of symptoms, (2) left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <50%) in an asymptomatic patient, or (3) a concomitant cardiac surgical procedure for other indications. Exertional dyspnea, syncope, and angina are the most common presenting symptoms that result in aortic valve intervention. Aortic valve replacement can be performed with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or via transcatheter approach (TAVI). TAVI is recommended in preference to SAVR for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who are older than 80 years or for younger patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years. TAVI is also recommended for symptomatic patients of any age with severe aortic stenosis and a high or prohibitive surgical risk if predicted postprocedure survival is more than 12 months with an acceptable quality of life. For symptomatic patients aged 65 to 80 years, either SAVR or TAVI is appropriate following shared decision making."
