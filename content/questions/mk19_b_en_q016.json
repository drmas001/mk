"). Diffuse signs and symptoms of skeletal disease versus an isolated low-energy fracture should raise suspicion for bone disorders other than osteoporosis. In the setting of disorders associated with malabsorption such as celiac disease or gastric bypass surgery, chronic deficiencies of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus can lead to osteomalacia, manifesting as impaired skeletal mineralization and low bone mineral density (BMD). Diffuse pain with weight bearing or palpation, especially if accompanied by fractures of ribs and bones of the pelvis and feet, are late presentations of osteomalacia. A progressive rise in total alkaline phosphatase precedes overt hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia and is an early indicator that low BMD is the result of osteomalacia rather than osteoporosis. Very low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and low urine calcium excretion could serve as corroborating evidence that this patient has osteomalacia caused by malabsorption."

") both appear as widespread focal uptake on whole-body bone scan. However, generalized increase in tracer uptake in the entire skeleton in addition to the focal “hotspots” is seen with osteomalacia and not with malignancy. Radiography, CT, or MRI examination of areas of concern on bone scan can further distinguish between metastases, insufficiency fractures, and pseudofractures of osteomalacia. Finally, bone metastases are more commonly associated with hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia."

A bone biopsy would be needed to determine the relative contribution of each to impaired skeletal strength. Osteomalacia is further suggested by improvement in clinical, biochemical, and BMD improvement with treatment of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D therapy would result in minimal improvement in BMD if osteoporosis were the primary process."
