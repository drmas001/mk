"A 71-year-old man undergoes follow-up consultation regarding a bone biopsy of the right fifth metatarsal head. The patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the plantar aspect of the right foot that developed 10 weeks ago. A plain radiograph showed evidence of osteomyelitis of the fifth metatarsal head, and a biopsy of the involved bone was obtained. Medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Medications are metformin, sitagliptin, and amlodipine."

" The much anticipated OVIVA study published in January 2019 showed that oral antibiotics with high bioavailability were noninferior to intravenous antibiotics for the management of osteomyelitis. Although data from randomized controlled trials is scarce, a treatment duration of 6 weeks has been generally recommended for osteomyelitis in adults. Longer courses of therapy may be necessary in infections with significant residual necrotic bone, in the setting of orthopedic hardware when the hardware cannot be removed, or when oral antibiotics are used."
