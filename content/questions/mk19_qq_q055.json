") is the most appropriate next diagnostic test for this patient with decreased libido. Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome that results from failure of the testes to produce physiologic levels of testosterone and a normal number of spermatozoa caused by disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Specific symptoms of hypogonadism in the adult male include decreased morning and spontaneous erections, mastodynia, gynecomastia, decreased need for shaving, and/or decreased axillary and genital hair. According to Endocrine Society guidelines, an initial morning measurement of a patient's total testosterone level should be performed to assess for hypogonadism; if results are abnormal, a second confirmatory morning measurement should be obtained before additional testing is begun. This recommendation is based on many studies showing that variability in testosterone levels from day to day or diurnally is common, with morning total testosterone levels being the most accurate in indicating a patient's androgen status."

In addition, this patient has no risk factors for altered sex hormoneâ€“binding globulin levels (obesity and older age), which would make a total testosterone level less reliable. Therefore, he has no need for a free testosterone assessment."
