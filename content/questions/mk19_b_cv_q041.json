"A 69-year-old man is evaluated for persistent angina despite maximally tolerated antianginal therapy. Symptoms appear after walking less than one-half mile and interfere with his quality of life and occupation as a mail carrier. He has no pain at rest or heart failure symptoms. He frequently experiences light-headedness when arising from a seated position. He has a 20-pack-year history of smoking but stopped 25 years ago. Medications are aspirin, metoprolol, sublingual nitroglycerin, and rosuvastatin."

") is the most appropriate management for this patient who has persistent angina despite maximally tolerated medical therapy. In this setting, invasive imaging for revascularization assessment is appropriate to improve symptom status and quality of life. Revascularization targets are identified on the basis of anatomic and functional physiologic characteristics associated with myocardial ischemia. Techniques such as fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio provide information on the functional hemodynamic significance of indeterminate lesions identified on angiographic imaging, reducing both unnecessary stenting and the need for urgent revascularization. In contrast, in unstable or in many acute presentations, revascularization is indicated to prevent future events and improve survival. The risks and benefits of and alternatives to angiography should be discussed, along with potential findings and therapeutic options. Other indications for coronary artery imaging include the presence of clinical findings or indications on noninvasive testing that are associated with severe ischemic heart disease. Other patients who may benefit from coronary artery imaging are those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and the presence of ischemia and other high-risk criteria on noninvasive testing."
