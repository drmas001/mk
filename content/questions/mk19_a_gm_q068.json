"). Meclizine is a centrally acting antihistamine associated with increased fall risk in elderly patients. Many health conditions, physical characteristics, and behaviors increase risk for falling, but the greatest increases are associated with cognitive impairment, psychoactive medications, gait/balance problems, and decreased lower extremity strength. The presence of multiple risk factors has an additive effect on fall risk. Even fear of falling in the absence of falls decreases self-rated health and hastens functional decline. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is used to help assess fall risk. This test involves asking the patient to rise from a chair with armrests, walk 10 feet, turn, return to the chair, and sit down. A TUG Test result of more than 12 seconds should prompt intervention to reduce fall risk."

"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common form of vertigo. Symptoms lead to increased risk for falls and a decline in functional status. First-line therapy for BPPV is canalith repositioning with the Epley maneuver, which is effective in up to 85% of patients. Medication is not useful in the treatment of BPPV except when the episodes are frequent and disabling. In that situation, the vestibular suppressant betahistine (not available in the United States) may be helpful along with the Epley maneuver. Meclizine probably contributed to this patient's near fall and fear of falling and is not especially helpful in controlling the symptoms of BPPV; it should be discontinued."
