"). These drugs, including anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (anti-CTL-4) (ipilimumab, tremelimumab, and pembrolizumab) antibodies, are used to treat many solid tumors. Hypophysitis occurs in 0.5% to 17% of patients and often presents with headache and fatigue. Hypophysitis is more common in patients managed with anti-CTL-4 antibodies or combination therapy (anti-CTL-4 plus anti-PD-1 antibodies), in men, and in older patients. Although endocrine evaluation usually reveals adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency, as well as low levels of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency is the most immediate concern because cortisol deficiency can be life-threatening. Imaging demonstrates enhancement or enlargement of the pituitary gland with thickening of the pituitary stalk. Diabetes insipidus is uncommon. Treatment includes replacement of the hormone deficiencies and high-dose glucocorticoids in severe cases to treat the inflammatory process, although hormone deficiencies often persist. It is important to replace cortisol before initiation of thyroid hormone to avoid precipitating an adrenal crisis."

Most patients with pituitary sarcoidosis have evidence of sarcoidosis elsewhere, typically the lungs (>90% of cases). Isolated pituitary sarcoidosis is rare, and the absence of diabetes insipidus also argues against this diagnosis."
