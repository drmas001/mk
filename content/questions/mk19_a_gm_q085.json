"). This patient has generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is characterized by excessive anxiety about activities or events (occupation, school) that a patient finds difficult to control and occurs more days than not for at least 6 months. These symptoms cause significant distress and functional impairment. Diagnosis also requires the presence of three of the following physical symptoms: restlessness, being easily fatigued, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. Clinicians must rule out physiologic effects of another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism; substance abuse; medication effect; and symptom-driven anxiety, such as anxiety secondary to dyspnea). Patients with significant anxiety or multiple unexplained physical symptoms should be screened for GAD by using the GAD-7 screening tool. This patient's GAD-7 score of 16 indicates severe anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), buspirone, and tricyclic antidepressants are all effective treatment options for GAD, and CBT is often used in combination with pharmacotherapy. SSRIs and SNRIs are preferred first-line agents because they have fewer side effects than tricyclic antidepressants and are effective in treating comorbid mood disorders when present. Paroxetine, an SSRI, is an appropriate pharmacologic choice for this patient."
