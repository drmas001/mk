The degree of neutrophilia appears to be proportional to the amount smoked, and this neutrophilia can persist for a prolonged time even after cessation (for years in some persons). Several other factors can cause an asymptomatic increase in neutrophil count, including asplenia, chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and vigorous exercise. All patients who smoke should be counseled to stop smoking and should be offered pharmacologic assistance."
