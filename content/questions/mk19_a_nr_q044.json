"). This movement disorder is caused by loss of normal paralysis during the rapid eye movement phase of sleep, leading to violent movements and shouting as patients respond to their dreams. Patients are often unaware of the movements; these are typically reported by their bed partners. RBD is sometimes brought to attention as a result of injuries sustained by patients or their bed partners during sleep. RBD has a strong association with neurodegenerative disorders caused by synuclein accumulation, including Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, and may precede these disorders by decades. In this patient, the report by his wife, sleep study findings, and clinical evidence of a parkinsonian disorder (likely multiple system atrophy given the associated ataxia and dysautonomia) suggest RBD."
