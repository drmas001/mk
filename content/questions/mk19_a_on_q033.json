If the patient is compliant, uncomplicated, hemodynamically stable, does not have significant comorbidities, has no known increased risk to be harboring resistant organisms, and has an anticipated short duration of neutropenia, outpatient management is an option. Published criteria for risk stratification for outpatient management include the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer index, Talcott's rules, or Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia. Published criteria for outpatient management include (1) residence ≤1 hour or ≤30 miles (48 km) from the clinic or hospital, (2) patient's primary care physician or oncologist agrees to outpatient management, (3) ability to comply with logistic requirements, including frequent clinic visits, (4) family member or caregiver at home 24 hours/day, (5) access to a telephone and transportation 24 hours/day, and (6) no history of noncompliance with treatment protocols. Patients should have frequent follow-up by phone or in the office to reassess their status."
