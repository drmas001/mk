"). Warfarin should be withheld a minimum of 5 days before surgery to normalize the patient's INR. The timing of warfarin discontinuation is based on its 36- to 42-hour half-life and clinical studies documenting the time for the INR to return to normal following discontinuation. In general, 2 to 3 days are required for the INR to drop below 2 and 4 to 6 days for the INR to normalize. Some physicians obtain an INR on day 4 and intervene with vitamin K supplementation if necessary for persistently elevated INRs. Postoperative re-initiation of anticoagulation should be guided by the patient's thrombotic and bleeding risk and determined in collaboration with the surgical team. Owing to its delayed effect, the first dose of warfarin is typically administered 12 to 24 hours after surgery, pending adequate hemostasis and barring any surgical complications that may increase the risk for bleeding. It usually takes 5 to 6 days to achieve a therapeutic INR."
