"Erythroderma is the most likely diagnosis. Erythroderma is defined as redness and scaling of 80% to 90% of the body surface area. It primarily affects middle-aged men. The most common cause of erythroderma is a preexisting condition, although 40% of cases are idiopathic. Patients with a history of psoriasis who are treated with systemic glucocorticoids, often for another condition, may develop a widespread erythrodermic or pustular flare when the glucocorticoids are discontinued. The presence of alopecia, nail dystrophy, and thickening of the palms and soles are indicative of a long-standing underlying cause of erythroderma, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, graft-versus-host disease, psoriasis, or pityriasis rubra pilaris. When erythroderma is acute, thick scaling of the palms and soles and nail changes do not occur. Erythroderma may be complicated by loss of fluid and heat across the inflamed skin."
