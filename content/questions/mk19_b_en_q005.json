"). The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is physiologic, related to pregnancy and lactation. Physiologic stress, coitus, sleep, and nipple stimulation are other nonpathologic causes of mild hyperprolactinemia. The most common cause of pathologic non-tumor-related hyperprolactinemia is medication; however, other causes of hyperprolactinemia must be considered for this patient. Her symptoms of fatigue, constipation, weight gain, and menorrhagia are consistent with hypothyroidism. Overt primary hypothyroidism is a cause of hyperprolactinemia. The mechanism of hyperprolactinemia in hypothyroidism is related to release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, which stimulates both TSH and prolactin. For a patient presenting with both hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism, the hypothyroidism should be treated first and then the prolactin level should be retested to ensure that the hyperprolactinemia has resolved."

"), a dopamine agonist, is the preferred agent because of its superior efficacy in lowering prolactin and tumor shrinkage compared with bromocriptine. For this patient, a pituitary prolactinoma has not yet been diagnosed; therefore, consideration of cabergoline is premature. Although cabergoline is an appropriate therapy for a patient with hyperprolactinemia caused by a prolactinoma, this patient's hyperprolactinemia may be explained by hypothyroidism."
