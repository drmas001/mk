"). Cutaneous lupus erythematosus can exist with or without systemic disease. There are three primary patterns of lupus-specific skin rashes: ACLE, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The lupus-specific skin diseases are not found in other conditions and have varying associations with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Identifying the pattern of the skin disease can be important for guiding additional evaluation and treatment. ACLE often presents with a photosensitive malar or butterfly rash, with patchy, edematous, erythematous areas on the cheeks and over the nose, sparing the nasolabial folds. Similar rashes can occur on other sun-exposed skin, including the neck, upper chest, and arms. Nearly all patients with ACLE have SLE, and as such tend to have systemic symptoms and positive serologic results (typically antinuclear, anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB antibodies)."

The latter may resolve with withdrawal of the causative agent. This patient's rash does not match the typical presentation of SCLE."
