"). This patient has classic clinical and laboratory features of dermatomyositis with myositis-associated autoantibodies and no evidence of associated malignancy or other complications. In particular, the presence of anti–Mi-2 antibodies predicts a good prognosis with a low risk for interstitial lung disease and cancer. Her symptoms have completely resolved with an initial course of oral prednisone, typically initiated at 1 mg/kg/d. Combination therapy with glucocorticoid-sparing agents is important for maintaining a clinical response and for minimizing glucocorticoid adverse effects in patients with dermatomyositis. Initiation of methotrexate or azathioprine at diagnosis or after an early initial response to glucocorticoids is the most appropriate next step to achieve long-term disease control and to allow effective tapering of the prednisone dose. Intravenous immune globulin can be added as first- or second-line treatment for patients with an inadequate response to initial combination therapy or with more severe disease. There is no guidance for optimal duration of therapy, but in the absence of flares, most patients can discontinue treatment in 9 to 12 months. Physical therapy may help maintain muscle function and should be used in all patients."
