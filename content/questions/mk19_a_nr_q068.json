"A 45-year-old woman is evaluated for sleeping difficulties. Her main symptom is an uncomfortable urge to move her legs when she is at rest or in bed at night. This may result in difficulty falling asleep or sometimes in maintaining sleep. She may wake up three to five times a night and then walk around the house for a few minutes to relieve her symptoms before attempting to go back to sleep. Her husband reports no snoring or witnessed apneic episodes or daytime sleepiness."

"). Although most patients with insomnia do not benefit from diagnostic testing, signs or symptoms suggesting an associated medical condition, such as depression, anxiety, or sleep apnea, should be evaluated. This patient has symptoms of restless leg syndrome (RLS). RLS is a common movement disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs. Patients report an uncomfortable sensation that is worse at rest and at night and is transiently relieved by movement. RLS can interfere with falling or staying asleep and may be associated with periodic limb movements of sleep. Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are brief triple flexion movements of the legs that repeat in 20-second cycles during sleep. This disorder is very common and can occur independently of or be associated with RLS, sleep-disordered breathing, or narcolepsy. The diagnosis of PLMS is made by using polysomnography. Treatment of PLMS is required only if it causes marked sleep fragmentation. Patients with RLS should be screened for iron deficiency because iron supplementation in the presence of low-normal serum ferritin levels may resolve the symptoms."
