"A 53-year-old woman is evaluated in the coronary care unit. She underwent successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement in the mid right coronary artery for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the catheterization laboratory, she had several episodes of symptomatic 2:1 atrioventricular block with sinus bradycardia. After returning to the coronary care unit, she has symptomatic intermittent 2:1 atrioventricular block and several episodes of complete heart block with a narrow-complex escape rhythm (heart rate at 58/min). Medications are atorvastatin, aspirin, and clopidogrel."

"). Conduction abnormalities are commonly identified in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and are managed on the basis of the type of block and the location of myocardial injury. Symptomatic patients with inferior MI and transient heart block may be treated with temporary pacing because conduction block in this setting, including Mobitz type 1 and complete heart block, is caused by high vagal tone affecting the atrioventricular (AV) node, is generally transient, and is accompanied by an adequate escape rhythm. Whereas temporary pacing support may occasionally be necessary, permanent pacing (",

"attrs":{

") is rarely indicated. Vagally mediated heart block occurring at the AV node must be distinguished from the less benign and potentially lethal Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block, which occurs more frequently in the setting of extensive anterior MI and damage to the conduction system below the AV node. Although Mobitz type 1 block occurs at the AV node and is identified by cyclical, repetitive prolongation of the PR interval leading to a “dropped beat” and a regularly irregular rhythm, Mobitz type 2 block is typified by block conduction without associated PR prolongation and may predispose to extended periods of asystole, requiring permanent pacemaker support."
