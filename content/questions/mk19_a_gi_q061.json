"). This patient has recurrent symptoms of ulcerative colitis on tapering of glucocorticoids. Although glucocorticoids induce remission in moderate to severe flares of ulcerative colitis, they should not be used to maintain remission. Azathioprine and the anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents infliximab and golimumab induce and maintain remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine is more efficacious than monotherapy with either agent alone in achieving glucocorticoid-free remission and mucosal healing. Before initiation of anti-TNF agents, patients should undergo testing for latent tuberculosis because of an increased risk for reactivation of tuberculosis during therapy. If latent tuberculosis is present, treatment with isoniazid should be administered for at least 2 months before initiation of anti-TNF therapy. Patients should also be assessed for chronic hepatitis B virus infection before starting anti-TNF therapy and receive treatment if needed."

"Thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine) are immunomodulators used as glucocorticoid-sparing agents in ulcerative colitis. They have a slow onset of action (2-3 months), and patients require a tapering glucocorticoid regimen to bridge the interval until the thiopurines take effect. Thiopurines are no more effective than placebo in inducing short-term symptomatic remission and should not be used in this manner. Given the slow onset of action, beginning azathioprine alone (",

It is effective in inducing remission in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis unresponsive to 5-aminosalicylate. However, because multimatrix budesonide is effective only in inducing remission, it would be inappropriate for this patient, who requires an induction and a maintenance agent. In addition, he is already receiving a glucocorticoid and is steroid dependent."
