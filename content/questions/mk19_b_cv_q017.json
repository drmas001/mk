") is the most appropriate management for this patient with asymptomatic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure or exertional limitations. No additional evaluation is necessary because this patient's PVCs are asymptomatic and not accompanied by other signs or symptoms of cardiopulmonary disease. Ambulatory ECG monitoring for assessment of PVC burden may be performed, but in an asymptomatic patient, results are unlikely to affect management. Asymptomatic PVCs, even at higher burden, are common in the general population and may vary dramatically throughout the day and/or from day to day. They may be influenced by stress, alcohol or caffeine intake, sleep disturbances, and comorbid conditions, such as thyroid disorders or anemia. In the absence of a significant comorbid condition and/or symptoms, reassurance is appropriate. Among patients with a consistently very high burden of PVCs (≥15%-20%) that are asymptomatic, periodic echocardiographic monitoring for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy may be considered, but there is no consensus on this surveillance."
