He reports no change in hearing, tinnitus, or recent viral symptoms. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications are amlodipine, enalapril, and atorvastatin."

") is the most appropriate next step in management. This patient presents with a clinical history and examination findings concerning for vertebrobasilar stroke. About 20% of patients with vertebrobasilar stroke present with isolated vertigo, and these symptoms can be misclassified as peripheral vertigo. Clues to the diagnosis are the patient's advanced age, vascular disease risk factors, and constant vertigo. An abnormal result on any one of the three HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew) examination components suggests a central rather than peripheral cause of acute vertigo; this patient demonstrated vertical skew. Patients with central vertigo secondary to vertebrobasilar stroke frequently, but not invariably, display neurologic findings in addition to vertigo, such as this patient's ataxia and postural instability. Urgent brain MRI would confirm the diagnosis. For acute stroke, either noncontrast CT or MRI is recommended to exclude hemorrhage before administration of alteplase. However, this patient has exceeded the 3-hour window for thrombolytic therapy, and hemorrhagic stroke in the territory of the posterior circulation is an unlikely cause of persistent and isolated vertigo. MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke and is the preferred imaging test in this situation."
