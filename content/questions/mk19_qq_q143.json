"). Any abnormal vaginal bleeding occurring in perimenopausal women and bleeding in postmenopausal women warrant evaluation to rule out malignancy, usually with endometrial biopsy. This patient has an anovulatory pattern of bleeding based on the unpredictable occurrence of bleeding of variable flow and duration. In women with prolonged anovulation, there is exposure to unopposed estrogen without the normal endometrial protective effect of progesterone. This increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy. Additional risk factors for endometrial cancer include age 45 years and older, obesity, and prolonged exposure to estrogen without progesterone other than anovulation (early menarche, nulliparity, late menopause). In women younger than 45 years with anovulatory bleeding and no other risk factors for endometrial cancer, hormonal therapy for anovulation is appropriate. However, in women younger than 45 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, endometrial biopsy should be performed to exclude significant endometrial pathology. This 49-year-old woman with abnormal uterine bleeding is at higher risk for cancer and should have an endometrial biopsy."
