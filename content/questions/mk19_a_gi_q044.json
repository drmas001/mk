"). This patient had upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to a Mallory-Weiss tear. This small mucosal defect may occur after repeated vomiting and may cause bleeding, often self-limited. In this patient, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), omeprazole, was started during hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding, before endoscopy and the diagnosis of Mallory-Weiss tear, and the drug was never discontinued. PPI therapy is given to all patients suspected of having clinically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding before endoscopy as part of their initial management and is continued following hospital discharge in patients with bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease. In patients with Mallory-Weiss tear, PPI therapy to prevent recurrent bleeding is less well studied but is not commonly used. This patient does not have a guideline-recommended indication for continued PPI use, and it would be appropriate to discontinue the omeprazole. Unnecessary continuation of PPIs after hospital discharge is a cause of PPI overuse. The goal should be to use the lowest dose to control symptoms and discontinue therapy if there is no appropriate indication. Adverse effects of PPI may include headache and gastrointestinal distress.
