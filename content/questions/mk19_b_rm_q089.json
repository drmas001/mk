"). This patient has had a first episode of podagra (gout of the great toe) treated effectively with colchicine. He has a minimally elevated serum urate level. Hydrochlorothiazide and other loop diuretics cause hyperuricemia and may have contributed to this gout episode. Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker that may have some uricosuric effect in addition to lowering blood pressure. For patients with gout, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conditionally recommends switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternate antihypertensive when feasible. The ACR also conditionally recommends switching to losartan preferentially as an antihypertensive agent when feasible. Although this patient has had only a single flare, modifying his iatrogenic risk factors for gout is reasonable at this time."

Urate-lowering therapy is strongly recommended by the ACR for patients with one or more subcutaneous tophi; evidence of radiographic damage (any modality) attributable to gout; or frequent gout flares, with “frequent” being defined as two or more annually. Urate-lowering therapy is conditionally recommended for patients experiencing their first flare when moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (stage ≥3), serum urate concentration greater than 9.0 mg/dL (0.53 mmol/L), or urolithiasis is present."
