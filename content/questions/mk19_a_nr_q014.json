According to the family, the initial seizure lasted for 3 minutes and stopped, but the patient did not regain consciousness and a second generalized tonic-clonic seizure started within 5 minutes and has continued. The patient received 4 mg intravenous lorazepam in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. In the emergency department, the seizure continues and he receives an additional 4 mg of intravenous lorazepam followed by another 2 mg 10 minutes later without benefit. The patient has a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures treated with levetiracetam."

"). This patients meets the clinical criteria for convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), defined as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting greater than 5 minutes, or two generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring within 5 minutes of each other and without a return to baseline mental status. CSE is a medical emergency. Empiric therapy is indicated without awaiting results of electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, serum studies, or lumbar puncture because a longer duration of CSE is strongly linked to worse outcomes. Securing the airway and obtaining intravenous access are the first steps in CSE management. If point-of-care glucose testing is not available, thiamine should be given, followed by intravenous glucose. This patient has failed first-line therapy of intravenous lorazepam. Intravenous fosphenytoin is indicated for second-line therapy. Fosphenytoin can cause acute bradycardia and hypotension. Intravenous valproic acid or levetiracetam are reasonable alternatives, provided that he is not already taking maximum doses of levetiracetam at home. Fosphenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam have similar efficacy as second-line agents."
