"). He has severe thyrotoxicosis with evidence of cardiac compromise, consistent with thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is differentiated from severe thyrotoxicosis by the presence of life-threatening complications such as hemodynamic compromise; it occurs often with discontinuation of antithyroid drug therapy, systemic illness, labor and delivery, surgery, or trauma. It has a high mortality rate (up to 30%) and requires intensive care for any precipitating illness, thyrotoxicosis-directed therapy, and supportive measures. Thyroid storm is treated with intravenous β-blockers (esmolol); thionamides, typically propylthiouracil, transitioning to methimazole when more stable; intravenous high-dose glucocorticoids; and potassium iodide. To avoid providing iodine substrate to the gland, iodide should be administered more than 1 hour after antithyroid drugs. Glucocorticoid therapy is a potent inhibitor of peripheral thyroxine (T",
