"). This patient's presentation of sore throat, cough, headache, nasal congestion, and malaise in the absence of fever, as well as the findings on physical examination, are consistent with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI), or the common cold. URIs are caused by a large variety of viruses, most commonly rhinovirus. Virus transmission is via inhalation or direct contact with secretions infected with viral particles. The overproduction of mucosal secretions is caused by infection of epithelial cells responsible for the mucociliary layer within the respiratory tract and oropharynx. Symptoms of an uncomplicated URI may persist for up to 2 weeks after initial infection, and cough may persist even after resolution of the acute illness. Treatment for the common cold focuses on symptom management, including reducing severity of discomfort caused by frequent coughing, sneezing, headache, sore throat, and malaise. Analgesics may help with myalgia and headache, whereas nasal symptoms may respond to intranasal cromolyn, intranasal ipratropium, or combination decongestant/antihistamines."
