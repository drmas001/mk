"). He has a family history meeting the Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome, an inherited cancer syndrome. It is characterized by germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes or the epithelial cell adhesion molecule gene, which leads to increased risk for neoplasia of the colon and other organs. Lynch syndrome was previously known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer; that name is no longer used because the syndrome is associated with polyps and because it may present as extra-colonic cancer. Lynch syndrome follows an autosomal dominant inheritance and should be suspected when the “3-2-1-1-0” rules are met: (at least) three family members with Lynch-related cancers, in two generations, with one family member a first-degree relative of the other two, at least one member affected before age 50 years, and no familial polyposis. Diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is confirmed if tumors are confirmed histologically and tumor tissue from a family member shows evidence of microsatellite instability or loss of mismatch repair protein expression."
