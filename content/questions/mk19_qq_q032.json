After every shock from an automated external defibrillator, it is necessary to continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for 2 minutes, or five cycles of 30 compressions and two breaths, without stopping to assess the rhythm. Although the postshock rhythm may be normal sinus, there can be pulseless electrical activity or ineffective cardiac output during this time. Chest compressions should be of adequate depth (>2 in) and at a rate of 100/min, allowing for full chest recoil."

"Guidelines support the administration of epinephrine for cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm after initial defibrillation attempts have failed. In patients with a nonshockable rhythm, it is reasonable to administer epinephrine as soon as possible. In either situation, epinephrine can be administered every 3 to 5 minutes. Vasopressin can be used alone or with epinephrine, but vasopressin offers no advantage to epinephrine. If the patient with a shockable rhythm is unresponsive to defibrillation and epinephrine, an intravenous antiarrhythmic agent, such as amiodarone or lidocaine (",

"All interruptions should be kept to a minimum during CPR because any break can lead to a reduction in coronary perfusion pressure and worse outcomes. The length of time that providers can withhold CPR during defibrillator charging, shock, and postshock rhythm check can be more than 30 seconds. Therefore, CPR should be continued after every shock for 2 minutes as a first step; after that, a rhythm check should be completed (",
