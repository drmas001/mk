It is a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice in patients able to tolerate oral intake. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) is also an appropriate empiric antibiotic choice. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated after a urine sample is obtained for analysis and culture and should be continued for 2 to 4 weeks; some experts recommend up to 6 weeks. Treatment can be modified on the basis of results of the urine culture."
