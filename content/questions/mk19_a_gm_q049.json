"). In most situations, adults with decision-making capacity have the legal and ethical right to accept or refuse medical treatments. This right is based on respect for the patient's autonomy, right to self-determination, and liberty. A patient's refusal of care should be explored thoughtfully and with empathy, with attention to the spectrum of reasonable choices. However, for informed refusal to be considered valid, the patient must be able to make her own decisions and be free from coercion. In this case, the care team has evidence that the patient may be being coerced to return home. The ethics committee should be consulted to determine the appropriate course of action."
