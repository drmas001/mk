She has been adherent with her medication, has excellent inhaler technique, and continues to use home oxygen. Between exacerbations she has a cough productive of thin, colorless sputum."

"-agonist, and a long-acting antimuscarinic agent, as well as albuterol as needed. Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin) have both inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Long-term macrolide therapy reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD and a history of frequent exacerbations. The major concern regarding long-term macrolide therapy is QT prolongation, but the risk for cardiovascular death associated with long-term azithromycin therapy is low (1 in 20,000) for patients without cardiac disease. Other standard interventions to reduce COPD exacerbations include smoking cessation, proper immunizations, and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, can also be used for patients with COPD and frequent exacerbations. There are no head-to-head comparisons of roflumilast with azithromycin. The choice of medication is determined by the medication's side effects, drug interactions, and contraindications."
