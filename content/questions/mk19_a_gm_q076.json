"). Multiple guidelines now issue a strong recommendation that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) should be the initial treatment for chronic insomnia; however, CBT-I is not available to many patients. The 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense guidelines on the management of chronic insomnia disorder recommend BBT-I as an alternative that may be more accessible and less time consuming for patients. BBT-I focuses on sleep restriction, stimulus control, and some sleep hygiene techniques, whereas CBT-I also includes relaxation therapy, counter-arousal strategies, and cognitive restructuring to address maladaptive thoughts or beliefs about sleep. These interventions can be delivered in person in an individual or group setting, or via online or telephone-based modules. Data are insufficient to make recommendations on the optimal delivery strategy, but most analyses have been performed on in-person interventions."

Addressing sleep hygiene is part of BBT-I and CBT-I. Evidence supporting sleep hygiene as effective standalone therapy for chronic insomnia is not available. The 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense guidelines on chronic insomnia recommend against sleep hygiene education as a standalone treatment for chronic insomnia, given this lack of evidence."
