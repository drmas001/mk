"). The abrupt onset of acute monoarticular inflammatory arthritis in any patient should suggest a joint infection. This patient has a history of long-standing rheumatoid arthritis that has damaged numerous joints. Previous joint damage increases the risk for joint infection. The patient also receives multiple immunosuppressive agents, which also increase risk for joint infection. Her joint examination, apart from the left knee, suggests quiescent rheumatoid arthritis rather than a generalized flare of disease, further raising suspicion for an infected joint. In patients suspected of having infectious arthritis, the most important diagnostic procedure is expeditious arthrocentesis to obtain joint fluid and conduct synovial fluid analysis (Gram stain, culture [bacterial and, when indicated, mycobacterial and/or fungal], leukocyte count, and crystal analysis)."

Synovial biopsies may be helpful in patients in whom concurrent contiguous osteomyelitis or tuberculosis (or infection with another slow-growing organism, such as a fungus) is a diagnostic possibility. The patient's short duration of symptoms makes concurrent osteomyelitis or infection with slow-growing organisms unlikely. Although tuberculosis or fungal infection cannot be absolutely excluded in this patient receiving immunosuppressant drugs, the first diagnostic test remains a synovial fluid analysis. A synovial biopsy may be considered in patients without an established diagnosis after joint fluid analysis or those in whom antibiotic therapy has failed."
