"). A pituitary lesion discovered incidentally on imaging is termed a “pituitary incidentaloma.” Small, incidentally noted pituitary lesions are common. In patients undergoing MRI for nonpituitary reasons, microadenomas are found in 10% to 38% of cases whereas incidental macroadenomas are seen in 0.2%. Most pituitary incidentalomas are benign nonfunctional adenomas. Pituitary hypersecretion should be ruled out by measurement of prolactin and insulin-like growth factor 1. Evaluation for Cushing disease is unnecessary in patients without signs or symptoms of cortisol excess. Pituitary tumors can also cause hypopituitarism. Screening for hypopituitarism is recommended in all patients with pituitary tumors, regardless of symptoms, with measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and total testosterone in men. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be assessed in premenopausal women through menstrual history. A history of normal menses essentially rules out hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and the need to measure FSH and LH."

However, this patient has no evidence of overt hypercortisolism, including supraclavicular fat pads, proximal muscle weakness, facial plethora, and wide violaceous striae or subclinical Cushing disease, which typically lacks these stigmata but instead presents with obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the absence of supporting symptoms or signs, tests for hypercortisolism are not needed."

") are a consideration because an inappropriately low urine osmolality in the setting of an elevated serum osmolality and hypernatremia in a patient with polyuria (>50 mL/kg/24 h in absence of glucosuria) is diagnostic of DI. However, there is no indication for DI testing. In addition, DI would be very unlikely in a patient with a small pituitary tumor."
