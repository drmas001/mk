") is the most appropriate preventive measure for this patient. Naloxone is a nonselective and competitive opioid receptor blocker that reduces the risk for death from respiratory depression due to accidental opioid overdose. It is available in intranasal and injectable forms for ease of administration. Naloxone acts within minutes and has a very short half-life; its antidote effects will usually wear off before the opioid effects are gone. Patients should be observed for signs of opioid withdrawal (which is not fatal and requires only supportive care) and for continued or recurrent signs of respiratory distress (which may require repeated dosing of naloxone). According to the CDC opioid prescribing guideline, clinicians should offer naloxone to any patient at risk for opioid overdose. This includes patients with a history of overdose or substance use disorder, patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (which should be avoided whenever possible), and those taking more than 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day. In addition, naloxone should be provided to patients taking opioids who have risk factors for opioid-related harms; such patients include elderly persons, patients with mental health conditions, and patients at risk for sleep-disordered breathing (such as those with heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, or obesity), regardless of oral morphine equivalents prescribed. This patient with a history of overdose should be prescribed naloxone and educated on its proper use and ways to reverse overdose and prevent overdose death. Friends, family members, and caretakers may also receive prescriptions and training in naloxone use."
