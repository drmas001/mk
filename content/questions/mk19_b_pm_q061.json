") intravenously. This patient has serotonin syndrome. Risk factors for serotonin syndrome include use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other medications (sometimes more than one) that increase nervous system serotonin activity. This patient takes paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Tramadol and cocaine also increase serotonin release in the central nervous system. Common signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include mental status changes, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tremor, autonomic instability, muscle and ocular clonus, and hyperreflexia. Treatment includes supportive measures, such as avoidance of any further serotonergic agents, and sedation with benzodiazepines to reduce agitation. Sedation blunts autonomic surges and reduces the muscle activity that contributes to hyperthermia. Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine with antiserotonergic activity, is used off-label as an antidote in serotonin syndrome in patients who do not respond to benzodiazepine therapy. Its effectiveness has not been established in clinical trials, and use is based on expert opinion and case series. It is available only in pill and syrup formulations so must be administered orally, which is sometimes a challenge in uncooperative patients."
