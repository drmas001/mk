"An 84-year-old man is evaluated 3 days after he was admitted to the ICU with a right lower lobe infiltrate and presumed sepsis. Prior to admission, the patient had vomited, aspirated, and developed respiratory distress. In the emergency department, temperature was 38.3 °C (100.9 °F); tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and hypotension were also present. Chest radiograph on admission showed an infiltrate in the right lower lobe. Intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were given. Over the next 24 hours, the patient improved rapidly."

"). In patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and lower respiratory tract infiltrate, it is often difficult to determine whether the cause of the infiltrates is a bacterial infection or another source such as a viral infection or aspiration pneumonitis. Ultimately, the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis is clinical. Indicators include abrupt onset of respiratory symptoms following aspiration of gastric contents, low-grade fever, and infiltrates on chest imaging. The 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends standard empiric treatment for CAP in patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. Many patients with aspiration pneumonitis experience rapid resolution of symptoms within 24 to 48 hours. In these patients, removal of antibiotics and supportive care alone is preferred. Because this patient improved clinically within 24 hours of admission, aspiration pneumonitis is likely and it is safe to discontinue therapy."
