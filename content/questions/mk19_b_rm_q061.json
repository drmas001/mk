"). This patient has chronic tophaceous gout with a persistently elevated urate level above target (<6.0 mg/dL [0.35 mmol/L]) despite maximum-dose febuxostat. Switching to pegloticase rather than continuing current urate-lowering therapy is strongly recommended for patients with gout for whom allopurinol, febuxostat, or uricosurics have failed to achieve the serum urate target and who continue to have frequent gout flares (two or more flares per year) or who have subcutaneous tophi. Because this patient is allergic to allopurinol and febuxostat has failed, pegloticase is indicated. Pegloticase is recombinant pegylated uricase administered intravenously every 2 weeks. All patients should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity before administration of pegloticase; low activity of G6PD poses a risk for hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia, and pegloticase is contraindicated in that setting. Pegloticase rapidly lowers the serum urate level, and prophylactic therapy (colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids) must be administered concurrently with treatment. Formation of antibody to pegloticase may occur (30%-50% of patients) and cause severe infusion reactions. Serum urate level must be checked before each infusion. After the initial dose, a serum urate level greater than 6.0 mg/dL (0.35 mmol/L) on two consecutive assessments indicates loss of efficacy due to antibody formation, necessitating discontinuation of pegloticase. Pegloticase should not be given with any other urate-lowering therapy so that interpretation of the serum urate level before each infusion is clear. Therefore, this patient should discontinue febuxostat."
