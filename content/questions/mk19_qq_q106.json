"). Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Tamoxifen is used as adjuvant endocrine therapy in selected women with breast cancer who have hormone receptor–positive tumors. Patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancers should receive tamoxifen for at least 5 years. In premenopausal women with low-risk invasive breast cancer who do not require adjuvant chemotherapy, tamoxifen for at least 5 years, and preferably 10 years, is recommended. This premenopausal woman has intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is classified as stage 0 (noninvasive) breast cancer. Initial treatment is lumpectomy, often followed by breast irradiation; mastectomy may be recommended if the DCIS cannot be fully removed by wide excisional lumpectomy. Because her DCIS is estrogen receptor (ER) positive, adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years is recommended to decrease risk for local recurrence and contralateral breast cancer."

") is a superior adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women younger than 60 years who have ER-positive breast cancer, but it would not be recommended in this premenopausal woman. Concerns exist that reduced feedback of estrogen to the hypothalamus and pituitary will stimulate gonadotropin secretion and lead to an increase in ovarian androgen substrate and aromatase production, which would stimulate growth of hormonally responsive cancers. Patients who become postmenopausal while taking tamoxifen may be changed to an aromatase inhibitor."
