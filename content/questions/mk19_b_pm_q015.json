"). The diagnosis of a malignant pleural effusion signifies advanced disease and overall poor prognosis (usually 4-7 months from the time of diagnosis). In these patients, the goal of management is relief of symptoms. Several therapeutic options exist, and treatment decisions should be based on symptoms, prognosis, degree of anticipated lung re-expansion, and patient performance status. The patient has a recurrent symptomatic malignant pleural effusion that requires definitive management given the rapidity of recurrence. Initial treatment choices include IPC and chemical pleurodesis with talc, and either may be used as first-line treatment in patients with expandable lung. In this patient, however, because there is evidence of incomplete lung expansion on his post-thoracentesis radiographs, the treatment of choice is IPC. Incomplete expansion of the lung is common in malignant pleural effusion. It is diagnosed with either pleural manometry (measurement of intrapleural pressures during a thoracentesis) or, as in this patient, evidence of incomplete re-expansion (air replacing the drained pleural effusion) on a post-thoracentesis chest radiograph. Nonexpandable lung has a variety of causes, including pleural thickening, pleural tumor, septations, loculations, and endobronchial obstruction."

Successful pleurodesis requires apposition of the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces, which limits the use of this treatment in patients with an unexpanded lung."
