") are indicated for this patient with knee osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a chronic progressive multifactorial disorder of maladaptive cellular repair responses to joint stress. It affects all the tissues of the joint and is characterized by cartilage and meniscal degradation, subchondral bone changes (bone marrow lesions, subchondral sclerosis), and osteophyte formation. This patient's knee pain suggests tibiofemoral knee OA, a diagnosis supported by the presence of medial joint-line tenderness and radiographic findings of medial tibiofemoral compartment joint-space narrowing. The strongest risk factors for OA are advancing age, obesity, female sex, joint injury (caused by occupation, repetitive use, or actual trauma), and genetic factors. Obesity, in particular, is the most important modifiable risk factor for knee OA. Several trials have demonstrated that weight loss and/or exercise programs can relieve pain and improve function, similar to the benefits of NSAID use. In long-term studies, sustained weight loss of approximately 6.8 kg (15 lb) has relieved symptoms. The 2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline for the management of OA strongly recommends exercise and weight loss for knee OA. Other strongly recommended therapies for knee OA include self-management programs, tai chi, use of a cane or a tibiofemoral knee brace, oral and topical NSAIDs, and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection."

"), a partial opioid with fewer adverse effects and less addictive potential than pure opioids, may be considered in some patients in whom other analgesics have not relieved pain. Nonetheless, concerns about the potential for adverse effects of tramadol continue. The 2019 American College of Rheumatology guideline recommends against non-tramadol opioids, such as oxycodone, in patients with knee, hip, or hand OA; use can be considered in limited circumstances when no other alternatives exist."
