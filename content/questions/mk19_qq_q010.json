"). Portal venous hypertension develops in the setting of advanced cirrhosis due to obstruction of blood flow caused by intrahepatic fibrosis, the development of regenerating liver nodules, and increased intrahepatic vascular resistance. Hypersplenism, often also associated with thrombocytopenia, further increases flow within the portal vein, exacerbating portal hypertension. Complications of portal hypertension include gastroesophageal varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Esophageal varices are enlarged vessels within the lumen of the lower esophagus that provide extrahepatic pathways of blood flow from the portal circulation to the systemic circulation. Over time, esophageal varices enlarge and may spontaneously rupture, leading to bleeding and possible death. Upper endoscopy should be performed on all patients with cirrhosis to assess for the presence of varices. Management of varices in patients with cirrhosis depends on the size of the varix and whether the cirrhosis is compensated. Although patients in the early stages of cirrhosis may be asymptomatic, metabolic encephalopathy and portal hypertension leading to ascites and gastroesophageal variceal disease indicate decompensated cirrhosis and a poor prognosis."
