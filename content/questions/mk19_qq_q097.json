Several over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, NSAIDs, and herbal supplements, have been implicated in qualitative platelet defects, which often present with increased bleeding or exacerbation of an underlying minor bleeding problem. These medications may also interfere with laboratory testing, such as platelet function testing, so it is necessary to elicit an accurate medication history."

"). The test is run on a citrated blood sample exposed to collagen and either epinephrine or adenosine diphosphate. It is a sensitive test for von Willebrand disease (vWD) and will detect abnormalities caused by antiplatelet medications. Platelet aggregation tests are very sensitive and are affected by various drugs and supplements; therefore, aggregation tests should not precede a review of over-the-counter medications."

Type 1 vWD, which is the mildest and most common type, usually begins at an early age and presents with mild bleeding symptoms, such as nosebleeds, easy bruising, and menorrhagia. Prothrombin time may be elevated or normal. It is not uncommon for children with mild symptoms not to be diagnosed with vWD. Therefore, it is reasonable to screen for vWD (",
