"). The patient's presentation and the positive serum cryptococcal antigen test indicate he has cryptococcal meningitis.

"/L). Risks related to early ART initiation are higher in resource-limited settings. In the United States and at centers with access to optimal antifungal therapy (amphotericin B) and the ability to monitor clinical status and intracranial pressure (including assessments for repeat lumbar puncture for drainage), ART can be started between 2 and 10 weeks of HIV diagnosis while the patient receives antifungal therapy. However, cautious monitoring for complications, including ICP and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, would be paramount in these cases. If that is not feasible, ART initiation should be delayed until 10 weeks of cryptococcal meningitis treatment has been completed. Additionally, patients who are prescribed abacavir must first undergo testing to show they are HLA-B*57:01 negative to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity."
