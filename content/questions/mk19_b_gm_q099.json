"). This patient likely has Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) that is secondary to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. SJS and TEN are a spectrum of severe mucocutaneous reactions defined by the extent of affected BSA involved with immune-mediated cutaneous necrosis. If 10% to 30% body surface area is affected, as in this patient, the reaction is termed SJS/TEN overlap syndrome. Symptoms of SJS/TEN usually begin within 1 to 3 weeks of exposure to the inciting agent. Fever, malaise, and symptoms of upper respiratory infection are followed by skin pain, grittiness or sand-like irritation of the eyes, and odynophagia. Within several days of symptom onset, patients develop red or purple dusky macules on the trunk that progress to vesicles, erosions, and ulceration. Painful erosions develop in the mouth, eyes, or genitals in as many as 95% of patients. When SJS/TEN is considered to be a possible diagnosis, the most important first step is to immediately discontinue all nonessential medications because continued exposure to the offending agent can worsen outcomes. The importance of immediate drug withdrawal in patients with SJS/TEN was highlighted in a 10-year observational study that suggested drug withdrawal reduced mortality by 30% for each day the drug was absent before the development of blisters and erosions. This observation did not hold true for drugs with prolonged half-lives."
