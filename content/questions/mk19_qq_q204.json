The USPSTF notes that although all women of childbearing age are at risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects and should take folic acid supplementation, some factors increase their risk, including a personal or family history (first- or second-degree relative) of neural tube defects. The risk of neural tube defects is also increased in women taking antiepileptic drugs."
