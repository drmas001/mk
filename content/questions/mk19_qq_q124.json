"). He has pneumonia complicated by thyroid storm, a life-threatening condition. Common precipitants of thyroid storm include iatrogenic causes, such as therapy with radioactive iodine, abrupt cessation of antithyroidal drugs, acute nonthyroidal illnesses, and thyroid or nonthyroid surgery in a patient with unrecognized or inadequately treated thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis of thyroid storm is clinical. What distinguishes thyroid storm from hyperthyroidism is the presence of severe and life-threatening symptoms, most often including cardiac dysfunction (tachyarrhythmias, shock, heart failure) and others (fever, delirium). A point scale, such as the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale, can be used to facilitate the early diagnosis of thyroid storm. There is no cutoff range of free thyroxine (T",

Appropriate therapy includes a combination of β-blockers, antithyroidal medications, potassium iodide, hydrocortisone therapy, cooling of body temperature, and treatment of any underlying precipitant. Iodide should be administered more than 1 hour after antithyroid drugs to avoid providing substrate to the gland."
