"). Although he has obesity and his father has type 2 diabetes, he may have type 1 diabetes presenting at an earlier stage of the disease process (when he still has significant endogenous insulin secretion) because of his obesity and insulin resistance. In young patients with probable diabetes, the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes should be made as soon as possible. The presence of ICAs, IAs, or GADAs is suggestive of type 1 diabetes, and he should begin receiving insulin immediately. Among patients with newly recognized type 1 diabetes, 90% have measurable antibodies against specific β-cell proteins present at the time of diagnosis. Insulin treatment in type 1 diabetes helps preserve endogenous insulin secretion for a longer period, which makes it easier to achieve excellent glycemic control without hypoglycemia. If testing does not show these antibodies, type 2 diabetes is more likely. In addition to lifestyle modifications, therapy with insulin may be required initially for this patient to control hyperglycemic symptoms, but then he may be transitioned to oral therapy, such as metformin."
