In immunocompromised patients (e.g., in those with advanced HIV infection), latent infection may reactivate and result in toxoplasmic encephalitis, which typically presents with multiple brain lesions that localize in the parietal or frontal lobes, in the thalamus or basal ganglia, or at the corticomedullary junction. Ring enhancement of the brain lesions occurs in approximately 90% of patients, and surrounding edema with mass effect is also present, as seen in this image. ",
