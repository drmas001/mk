"A 60-year-old man is evaluated for a 3-year history of gradual, progressive decline in his cognition, behavior, and motor skills. Both he and his wife have noticed these changes. He becomes agitated easily, and his wife reports that his personality is much more subdued than it used to be. He no longer enjoys socializing. Memory loss is not a prominent symptom. The patient played professional football for 5 years after college graduation. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His medications are lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin."

"). TES is the progressive neurodegenerative syndrome associated with repetitive head trauma. This clinical syndrome is associated with the pathological diagnosis referred to as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Consensus Diagnostic Criteria for TES require (1) substantial exposure to repetitive head impacts from contact sports, military service, or other causes; (2) core clinical features of cognitive impairment (in episodic memory and/or executive functioning) and/or neurobehavioral dysregulation; (3) a progressive course; and (4) that the clinical features are not fully accounted for by any other neurologic, psychiatric, or medical conditions. Supportive features include emotional dysregulation, behavior change, and motor disturbance with parkinsonian features. Diagnosis is supported by abnormal neuroimaging findings on PET, single-photon emission tomography, structural MRI, or diffusion-tensor imaging. A common but nonspecific finding includes generalized cerebral atrophy."

Although the cognitive profiles of TES and vascular cognitive impairment overlap, and this patient's slow gait and mood changes could be consistent with this diagnosis, the brain MRI shows no evidence of cerebrovascular disease."
