"). The first step in the evaluation of a patient with dizziness is to distinguish between its major causes: vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium. This patient describes vertigo, which is the sensation that her stationary environment is spinning around her (or that one is spinning around in one's environment). There are two major categories of vertigo: peripheral and central. In addition to history and risk factors, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is very helpful in distinguishing peripheral from central vertigo. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver indicates a peripheral vertigo when there is a latency period of 2 to 20 seconds before the onset of the positional nystagmus, the duration of nystagmus is less than 1 minute, and the nystagmus is fatigable with repeated Dix-Hallpike maneuvers. This patient has typical symptoms of BPPV, including episodes of vertigo lasting less than 1 minute and provocation by rapid changes in head movement, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver confirms the peripheral nature of her vertigo. Other common causes of peripheral vertigo include vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, and Meniere disease."

") is a cause of central vertigo and would cause a different pattern with Dix-Hallpike testing. When performed with a central disorder, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver provokes nystagmus with no latency, the nystagmus usually lasts more than 1 minute, and the nystagmus is not fatigable with repeated testing. In addition, cerebellar infarction usually leads to persistent symptoms (not episodic, like in this patient) and is often accompanied by gait impairment."
