"). This patient has recurrent prostate cancer after treatment for localized prostate cancer. The mainstay of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is ADT, provided by orchiectomy (surgical castration) or chemical castration. Surgical castration ADT provides cost-effective and rapid results and is widely used internationally. Chemical castration ADT is as effective as bilateral orchiectomy in treating patients with metastatic disease but is often preferred by patients in the United States. However, it requires repeated intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of hormonal agents. Chemical castration may be accomplished with a GnRH receptor agonist (leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, histrelin) or antagonist (degarelix). GnRH receptor agonists often initially trigger a surge of testosterone that can cause transient tumor growth; thereafter, the pituitary–testes axis is disrupted, which decreases testosterone levels and reduces the size of the tumor. The GnRH receptor antagonist degarelix lowers testosterone quickly and does not cause tumor flare. Oral antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and flutamide, directly block androgen receptors on cancer cells and are provided in combination with a GnRH agonist or antagonist. When used with a GnRH agonist, antiandrogens should be initiated first to protect against the transient testosterone surge caused by initiation of GnRH agonist therapy. In this patient with a lumbar spinal metastasis, ADT is indicated with surgical castration or a GnRH agonist or GnRH antagonist combined with an antiandrogen. Men with clinical metastatic disease who respond to ADT are considered to have castrate-sensitive prostate cancer. In this population, ADT can be combined with docetaxel, abiraterone/prednisone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide to improve survival. The choice of which specific agent to add to ADT is dependent on the volume of disease and prior treatment regimens. In a patient with metastatic disease following local therapy, such as radiation therapy, enzalutamide or apalutamide is indicated."
