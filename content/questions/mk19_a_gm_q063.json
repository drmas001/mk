"A 28-year-old man is evaluated in follow-up after a visit for multiple fluctuating somatic symptoms, including paresthesia, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, dizziness, muscle spasms, and fatigue. An extensive evaluation, including subspecialty consultation, laboratory testing, imaging, and diagnostic procedures, showed no clear diagnosis. He is frustrated at the lack of diagnosis and is concerned that “something is being missed.”"

"). Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are symptoms that cannot be attributed to a specific medical cause after a thorough medical evaluation. Common symptoms in patients with MUS include fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain (back pain, myalgia, arthralgia), dizziness, paresthesia, generalized weakness, transient edema, insomnia, dyspnea, chest pain, chronic facial pain, chronic pelvic pain, and chemical sensitivities. A collaborative therapeutic relationship is essential to providing care for patients with MUS. If an underlying medical cause cannot be identified after an appropriately thorough evaluation, it is imperative that clinicians have an open and honest discussion with the patient. This includes acknowledging the impact of the symptoms and addressing concerns that the patient may be perceived as malingering or presenting with factitious disease. Arranging for regular follow-up can strengthen the therapeutic alliance."
