"). The patient has migraine without aura. Migraine is a chronic neurobiologic disorder characterized by attacks of head pain and various associated features. Attacks are often separated by periods of normal brain function. Even at times of symptom freedom, patients possess an underlying predisposition for migraine episodes possibly because of a biologically based inherent hypersensitivity of the central nervous system. Exposure to certain internal and external factors may trigger a migraine attack in migraine-prone individuals while leaving those without such a predisposition unaffected. Patient surveys indicate stress or a poststress period (let-down effect) as the most common triggering factor. Changes in female hormones, sleep or meal pattern disruptions, weather factors, and strong sensory light, sound, or odor stimuli are also frequently reported as triggers. The goal of migraine prevention is the reduction of migraine frequency, intensity, and duration. The best agents may reduce migraine frequency by half in approximately half of the patients treated. Pharmacologic prophylaxis should be considered when the headache frequency reaches 5 days per month and almost always is initiated when the frequency exceeds 10 days per month. Venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is among the agents with Level A or Level B evidence of effectiveness in episodic migraine prevention. Propranolol, timolol, metoprolol, amitriptyline, topiramate, sodium valproate, erenumab, fremanezumab, eptinezumab, and galcanezumab are also considered beneficial in this setting."
