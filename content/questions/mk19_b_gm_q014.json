"). This patient has a history of migraine with aura, which is a contraindication to estrogen owing to increased risk for stroke. Women with contraindications to estrogen should be prescribed either a progesterone-only or a nonhormonal contraceptive option. For this patient, progesterone-only contraceptive options include the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, subdermal progestin implant, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection, or progesterone-only oral contraceptive pill. A nonhormonal contraceptive option is the copper IUD. The patient's history of multiple sexual male partners and being nulliparous are not a contraindication to IUD use. IUDs are well tolerated. Changes in menstrual bleeding patterns are the most common adverse effect. Complications include expulsion (3%-6% in the first year) and uterine perforation (approximately 0.1% of insertions). Contraindications to IUD placement include pregnancy; anatomic uterine abnormalities with distortion of the uterine cavity; and acute untreated pelvic infection. Risk for pelvic infection with IUD placement is low, and prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended during the procedure."
