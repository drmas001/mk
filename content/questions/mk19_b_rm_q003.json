The second and fourth toes on the right foot are diffusely swollen, as are the first and third toes on the left foot. Two small psoriatic plaques—one in the umbilicus and one on the scalp—are noted."

Five clinical subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, which often overlap, are recognized: symmetric polyarthritis, asymmetric oligoarthritis, distal interphalangeal–predominant disease, spondyloarthritis, and arthritis mutilans. Enthesitis, tenosynovitis, and dactylitis often occur. Dactylitis is found in 40% to 50% of patients with PsA and should always prompt consideration of a spondyloarthropathy. This patient has a classic distribution for PsA. The distal interphalangeal joints and an entire digit are involved (i.e., dactylitis), with sparing of other digits. This patient has evidence of limited psoriasis, but the extent of psoriatic skin involvement may not correlate with the extent of arthritis. In patients with PsA, affected peripheral joints sometimes take on a purplish discoloration due to hypervascularity. The Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) include evidence of psoriasis (current, past, and family history in first- or second-degree relatives), nail dystrophy, dactylitis (current or past), radiographic findings showing new bone formation, and a negative rheumatoid factor result. Each of these is assigned 1 point except for current psoriasis, which is assigned 2 points. These criteria are 91% sensitive and 98% specific for the diagnosis of PsA if 3 or more points are present. This patient's score is greater than 3."
