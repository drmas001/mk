"This patient's frontal radiograph suggests the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Chest radiographs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may demonstrate bibasilar septal line thickening with reticular changes and volume loss and bronchiectasis when the disease is more severe. The best diagnostic test is high-resolution CT, which may show abnormalities, such as bilateral-, peripheral-, and basal-predominant septal line thickening with honeycomb changes. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis typically presents in patients between 50 and 70 years of age who have a greater than 6-month duration of a dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. Lung examination is notable for \"Velcro\" inspiratory crackles that are predominant at the bases. Clubbing is present in up to 50% of patients."
