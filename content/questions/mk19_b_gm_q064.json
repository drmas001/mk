"). Emergency contraception refers to postcoital contraception using a device or medication to prevent pregnancy after inadequately protected intercourse. All forms of emergency contraception work by disrupting ovulation or preventing fertilization of an egg. Emergency contraceptives are not abortion-inducing interventions. FDA-approved options for emergency contraception include oral ulipristal acetate, oral levonorgestrel, or a copper intrauterine device (IUD). New data suggest that the 52-mg levonorgestrel IUD is noninferior to the copper IUD for emergency contraception, but it is not currently FDA approved for this indication. Ulipristal acetate delays ovulation. It is the preferred oral contraceptive option for women with a BMI greater than 26, such as this patient. A single oral dose of ulipristal acetate is effective for up to 5 days after unprotected sexual intercourse. Although a prescription is required for oral ulipristal acetate, an in-person medical visit is not required to provide this form of emergency contraception. The copper IUD is FDA approved for use as emergency contraception and is the most effective form of emergency contraception; it can reduce the risk for pregnancy by 99% if placed within 5 days of unprotected sexual intercourse. Copper IUDs prevent fertilization by unknown mechanisms and require a clinic visit for insertion."

") containing ethinyl estradiol or either norgestrel or levonorgestrel, but the dosing schedule is very different from the routine use of oral contraceptives. This method also requires a repeat dose at 12 hours. Combined oral contraceptive pills are less effective and are associated with higher rates of side effects compared with FDA-approved emergency contraceptive methods. Some experts will suggest this method to patients when cost is an issue or when quick access to FDA-approved emergency contraception is limited. Either the copper IUD or oral ulipristal acetate would be recommended as the most appropriate method for this patient."
