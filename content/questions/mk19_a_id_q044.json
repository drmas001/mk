"). She has a history of genital ulcer disease caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and has clinical findings consistent with recurrent genital herpes, so she should be provided with antiviral therapy. Reconfirmation of the diagnosis in the setting of a consistent clinical presentation is not necessary. Valacyclovir, acyclovir, and famciclovir are all acceptable antiviral regimens for management of recurrent genital HSV and will shorten the duration of this episode. Antiviral therapy for recurrent infection is recommended within 1 day of lesion onset or at the onset of prodromal symptoms. Regardless of the antiviral agent used, treatment regimens for recurrent genital HSV are short (2-5 days). The patient should be counseled that she may experience subsequent recurrences, and she can be provided with a prescription for antiviral therapy to begin immediately if she experiences another recurrence. Long-term suppressive therapy is an option if she experiences frequent subsequent recurrences or if she desires to reduce the potential for transmission to a future sexual partner who does not have HSV-2 infection. She should be counseled regarding the importance of informing future sexual partners of her diagnosis and the potential for viral shedding and transmission even without active lesions. HSV-2 seropositive persons are at increased risk for HIV acquisition, so the importance of condoms should be stressed."
