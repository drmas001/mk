" is the organism isolated most often. Evidence shows that treating ASB has no effect on the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), prevalence of bacteriuria, or survival. Screening for or treating ASB is not indicated in nonpregnant women or patients with diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injuries, or chronic indwelling urinary catheters. Treatment of these populations puts the patients at risk for drug adverse effects and increases the probability of antibiotic resistance. Screening for and treating ASB is indicated only in pregnancy and before invasive urologic procedures. Untreated ASB in pregnant women may be complicated by premature delivery, a low–birth-weight infant, or pyelonephritis. Untreated ASB in patients undergoing urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma can increase the risk for postoperative UTIs and sepsis."
