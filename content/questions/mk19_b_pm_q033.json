"). IPF is associated with the histopathologic appearance of usual interstitial pneumonia, the most common idiopathic form of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). It typically presents in patients between 50 and 70 years of age who have a greater than 6-month duration of a dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. History will reveal no potential cause for the development of fibrosis, and lung examination is notable for Velcro-like inspiratory crackles that are predominant at the bases. Clubbing is present in up to 50% of patients. The best diagnostic test is high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest, which may show abnormalities such as bilateral, peripheral, and basal predominant septal line thickening with honeycomb changes. The most appropriate next step in this patient's management is to discuss the patient's diagnosis in a multidisciplinary meeting involving a thoracic radiologist, a pathologist, and a pulmonologist; a multidisciplinary discussion may yield a confident diagnosis of IPF, without the need for a lung biopsy."

") typically present with cough, fever, and malaise for 6 to 8 weeks. Initial chest radiographs will demonstrate patchy opacities that mimic pneumonia, and as a result, patients are often initially misdiagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and treated with standard antibiotics. HRCT scans will demonstrate ground-glass opacities or areas of alveolar consolidation resembling an infectious pneumonia, but findings can include peripheral nodules and nodules along the bronchovascular bundle. This patient's age, long duration of symptoms, and honeycomb changes on HRCT scan do not fit the clinical picture of COP."
