"). Suicide in patients with epilepsy is estimated to be three times higher than in patients without epilepsy. This risk remains elevated in patients with or without known psychiatric disease, although psychiatric conditions are underdiagnosed in patients with epilepsy. Although antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been associated with increased risk of suicidality, the increased risk cannot be explained by medication use alone. Other identified risk factors for suicide among patients with epilepsy include male gender and high seizure frequency. Many antiepileptic drugs have mood-altering properties. Changes in therapy or dosages may result in unintended behavioral or psychiatric consequences. Examples include the discontinuation of AEDs with mood-stabilizing effects (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, valproic acid) or introduction of AEDs with adverse psychiatric manifestations (topiramate, gabapentin, levetiracetam). All AEDs carry a warning about worsening depression and suicidality, and all patients must be screened and monitored for these symptoms. For such screening, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 is effective and easy to use. If a patient provides a positive response to either of the two questions (“Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?” and “Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?”), further investigation for depression is warranted. Although all seizure medications carry a warning about suicidal ideation, it is important to identify the agents with the highest risk. Levetiracetam carries a higher incidence of causing or worsening depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation than other seizure medications. A recent retrospective review of AED use and side effects for 4085 adult patients started on a new AED regimen found that psychiatric and behavioral side effects occur significantly more frequently in patients taking levetiracetam and zonisamide than any other AED. On the other hand, carbamazepine, clobazam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid were significantly associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric and behavioral side effects. Therefore, levetiracetam is the drug that should be discontinued in this patient."
