"). Patients with achalasia present with dysphagia occurring with both solids and liquids along with nonacidic regurgitation of undigested food. Additional symptoms may include heartburn, weight loss, and chest pain unresponsive to acid-reducing agents. Symptoms are slowly progressive, with patients waiting an average of 5 years before seeking medical attention. Achalasia is a hypertonic motility condition defined by inadequate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and aperistalsis. Achalasia can be idiopathic or associated with viral, autoimmune, or neurodegenerative disorders and infection (Chagas disease). Damage to the ganglion cells and myenteric plexus in the esophageal body and LES leads to uncontested cholinergic nerve activation, which prevents LES relaxation. Approaches to the treatment of achalasia include endoscopic (botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilation, peroral endoscopic myotomy) or surgical intervention with the goal of lowering LES pressure, which relieves symptoms. Medical therapy with nitrates and calcium channel blockers is ineffective and not recommended."

Patients often have other atopic conditions, such as asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, and seasonal or food allergies. This patient's slowly progressive dysphagia for both solid food and liquids and regurgitation of undigested food are not compatible with the diagnosis of EoE."

") is a result of malignant tumor infiltration of the gastroesophageal junction or other secondary causes. It can present similarly to achalasia; however, unlike achalasia, this condition progresses rapidly and has been associated with sudden weight loss later in life, usually after age 50 years. Guidelines recommend performing upper endoscopy in all patients with suspected achalasia to exclude neoplastic pseudoachalasia. Other diagnostic modalities to exclude pseudoachalasia include endoscopic ultrasonography and CT. A 5-year history of dysphagia would not be compatible with cancer."
