Lichen planus is a relatively common T-cell–mediated disease presenting with pruritic purple papules that are often flat topped and have a polygonal appearance. Papules characteristically erupt on the low back, volar wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles. Other variants include nail, genital, bullous, atrophic, and hypertrophic lichen planus. Mucosal lesions have lacy white streaks (Wickham striae), as ",

") begins as a single annular patch or plaque with fine scaling (the herald patch), typically on the trunk, followed by numerous smaller skin-colored to pink papules and plaques erupting along skin cleavage lines. As a result of the Koebner phenomenon, scratching the lichen planus on the lower back can result in a linear-appearing rash, mimicking the appearance of pityriasis rosea. However, lichen planus is significantly more purple in color than pityriasis rosea and tends to erupt on the lower back, whereas pityriasis rosea tends to erupt on the upper and mid-back. This patient also has rash on her volar wrists, which would be an unusual finding in pityriasis rosea."

Nail psoriasis presents with nail pitting, onycholysis (separation of the nail plate from the nail bed), and “oil spots.” Other less common subtypes include guttate psoriasis (commonly seen in pediatric patients), palmoplantar psoriasis (frequently with pustules as the primary lesion), and inverse psoriasis (often seen without scale in the intertriginous areas). This patient's purple papules do not resemble the red plaques with thick scale of psoriasis."
