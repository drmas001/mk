") is the treatment of choice. Alcoholic hepatitis, an acute liver inflammation associated with alcohol intake, usually occurs in patients with a history of heavy and prolonged alcohol use. The MDF score is used to select patients for glucocorticoid treatment after ruling out contraindications, such as systemic infection, acute kidney injury, uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiorgan failure. If the patient shows improvement after the first week, glucocorticoids are continued along with nutritional support for a total of 28 days. Improved short-term survival (30 days) is achieved in approximately 50% of patients on glucocorticoids, whereas long-term survival heavily depends on the degree of coexistent chronic liver disease and abstinence from alcohol. Patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids may become candidates for liver transplantation or palliative care."
