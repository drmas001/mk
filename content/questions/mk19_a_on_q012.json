"). Metastatic breast cancer is treatable but not curable and is treated in a palliative manner to control disease growth and spread and to prolong life, rather than with curative intent. Essentially all patients with metastatic breast cancer should undergo a biopsy of the metastatic site to confirm the presence of metastatic disease and treatment goals. Breast cancer may be heterogeneous and, in some circumstances, important features such as estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status can differ between the initial primary breast cancer and the metastatic lesion. Therefore, biopsying the metastatic site allows treatment to be tailored to the metastatic disease subtype. Biopsy of the pulmonary lesion will not only assess whether there has been such a subtype switch, but it will also confirm stage IV disease. If choosing among biopsy site options, the lesion that upstages the patient to the greatest degree should be biopsied."
