"A 53-year-old woman is evaluated during a follow-up appointment. She has a 6-year history of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, which is complicated by chronic pain from spasticity of the large muscle groups in the lower extremities and diffuse burning pain in the upper and lower extremities with associated sensory derangements. Her pain syndrome has led to significant functional debility and has been minimally responsive to oral opioid, antiepileptic, and gabapentinoid therapies. Current medications are meloxicam, baclofen, and duloxetine."

") is most likely to improve this patient's chronic pain related to multiple sclerosis. Her pain is long-standing and debilitating despite trials of multiple different opioid and nonopioid therapies. Cannabis (marijuana) contains scores of pharmacologically active cannabinoids. Among them, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are most widely recognized. Unlike THC, CBD does not produce intoxication or euphoria. Medical cannabis, predominantly in forms containing higher concentrations of CBD, has shown some efficacy in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain. Systematic reviews have reported that the pharmacologically active cannabinoids—nabiximols, nabilone, dronabinol, oral cannabis extract, and THC—are associated with modest improvements in patient-reported spasticity measures. When spasticity was measured using the clinician-based Ashworth spasticity scale, there was a trend toward improvement with use of cannabinoids, but the effect was not statistically significant. Although cannabis is still classified as a schedule I agent by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, most states now allow patients to access cannabis products through state-administered medical cannabis programs or recreationally. The potency and purity of non–FDA-approved cannabinoid products may vary from their labeled content."
