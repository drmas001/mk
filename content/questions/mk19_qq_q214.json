"). This patient likely has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition and the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men. In the initial evaluation of patients presenting with bothersome LUTS possibly attributed to BPH, the American Urological Association (AUA) recommends clinicians take a medical history, conduct a physical examination, utilize the AUA Symptom Index (AUA-SI)/International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to quantify symptoms, and perform a urinalysis. This patient has some of the obstructive LUTS (hesitancy, weak urinary stream, straining, incomplete voiding, urinary retention, and overflow incontinence) due to bladder outlet obstruction. Patients also can experience irritative LUTS, which include frequency, urgency, and nocturia. In addition, prostate enlargement is evident in this patient's physical examination. BPH symptoms can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe by using the AUA-SI/IPSS, a validated clinical survey that quantifies and stratifies patients based on their symptoms; the results of the AUA-SI/IPSS can guide therapy. Urinalysis is recommended for all patients with BPH to assess for infection (bacteria and pyuria) and malignancy (hematuria)."
