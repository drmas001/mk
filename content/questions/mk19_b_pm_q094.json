") for this patient's atelectasis. The patient has postmastectomy pain that is impairing chest wall expansion, and she has developed atelectasis. Atelectasis is reported to occur in up to 90% of all anesthetized subjects, and it may persist for several days following surgery. Atelectasis can be the result of impaired respiratory mechanics after thoracic and abdominal surgeries resulting in shallow breathing patterns and avoidance of coughing. Atelectasis is associated with increased morbidity, including hypoxemia, retained secretions, and pneumonia. The management of atelectasis starts with focusing on the cause, in this case, pain. The patient is receiving inadequate pain control; the addition of multimodal pain control, which may include increased dosage of morphine, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentin, or nerve blocks, will improve pain control and chest expansion and may resolve the atelectasis. In addition to pain control, the application of chest physiotherapy is one of the first steps in management of atelectasis, if it can be tolerated by the patient."
