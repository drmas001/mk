In the perioperative period, PH, defined as pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) greater than 25 mm Hg, is associated with mortality rates of 4% to 24% and significant morbidity in up to 42% of patients. Potential complications of PH include myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, right ventricular (RV) failure, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary failure. Patients with high-risk PH features, including group 1 PH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), PAP greater than 70 mm Hg, and moderate or severe RV dysfunction, should undergo a thorough preoperative risk assessment by a PH specialist. Surgery should generally be avoided in patients with severe PH. This patient has severe COPD and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with evidence of PH and moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction. She should be referred to a PH specialist for evaluation prior to the elective procedure."
