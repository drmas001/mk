") will support the most likely diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. This patient's prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the presence of livedo reticularis, and newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism suggest antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS). Livedo reticularis is characterized by a blue or purple network-like pattern on the lower extremities and is classically the result of impaired blood flow in medium-sized cutaneous vessels due to vasculitis, vasospasm, hypercoagulable states, thrombosis, increased blood viscosity, or emboli. The APLAS diagnosis requires the presence of objectively documented arterial or venous thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity and positive laboratory results (lupus anticoagulant [LAC], anticardiolipin antibody assay, anti–β",

"-glycoprotein antibody assay) on at least two occasions at least 12 weeks apart. Pregnancy morbidity includes at least three unexplained pregnancy losses at less than 10 weeks' gestation; one or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at greater than 10 weeks' gestation; or one or more premature births of a normal fetus before 34 weeks' gestation because of eclampsia, preeclampsia, or placental insufficiency. LAC testing is functional coagulation testing to detect phospholipid-dependent inhibitors. Two commonly used tests optimized for this purpose are the dilute Russell viper venom time and aPTT. Because it is functional, LAC testing is affected by test timing in relation to the clot and anticoagulants. Antibody tests for anticardiolipin antibody and anti–β",

Hypercoagulability testing is not recommended in most patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, diagnosing APLAS is important because most patients typically need longer-term anticoagulation, and APLAS testing can influence the choice of anticoagulant."

"Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common inherited thrombophilia. Activated factor V combines with factor X to produce thrombin, which leads to clot formation. This process is regulated by activated protein C, which inactivates factor V to stop the process of ongoing clot formation. In FVL, mutated factor V resists cleavage by activated protein C, leading to a prothrombotic state. Although persons who are heterozygous have a fourfold to eightfold increased risk for developing a first VTE compared with otherwise healthy persons, most remain asymptomatic, and recent studies suggest that these patients are not at higher risk for recurrent thrombosis compared with healthy persons. This patient does not have a family history of thrombosis, and FVL does not increase the aPTT; therefore, genetic testing for FVL (",
