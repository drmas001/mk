Advanced imaging would be indicated in patients with abdominal or pelvic symptoms, abnormal physical examination, or unexplained elevation of aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase levels. Patients with stage III breast cancer have an elevated risk of asymptomatic distant metastases (14% in one study) and are therefore recommended to undergo routine imaging. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is most commonly used as the approach to staging. The role of PET/CT is not as well defined in staging patients with breast cancer."
