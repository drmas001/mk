"). This patient developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome as a result of risperidone (an atypical antipsychotic) and promethazine (an antiemetic agent). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is characterized by fever, mental status changes, muscle rigidity, and dysautonomia. The syndrome is seen both with first-generation antipsychotics and with newer atypical antipsychotics and antiemetics. It is most common at times of medication initiation or escalation of medication doses. It can also be caused by rapid withdrawal of dopaminergic medications. In addition to discontinuation of the triggering agents, active cooling and supportive care (including intravenous fluids) may be used. The mortality rate associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome may exceed 10%."

Initial management includes removal of the offending agents and supportive care, including benzodiazepines."
