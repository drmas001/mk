"), which was likely acquired from ingesting botulinum toxin–contaminated food during his cruise. Cranial nerve defects and bulbar signs (the 4 Ds: diplopia, dysphonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia) appear approximately 12 to 36 hours after toxin ingestion, followed by weakness and flaccid paralysis in the upper extremities, descending to the trunk and lower limbs. Obstructive upper airway issues and diaphragmatic weakness can lead to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Deep tendon reflexes can become diminished, but sensation remains intact. Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal manifestation but may be preceded by nausea and mild diarrhea. Botulism is not a febrile disease; however, alterations in parasympathetic autonomic function commonly occur. Mentation is not altered. No specific diagnostic laboratory abnormalities are associated with botulism. Imaging studies help exclude other neurologic entities. Confirmation relies on detecting toxin in foods, gastric secretions, stool, or serum. Supportive care and prompt administration of heptavalent botulinum antitoxin are the mainstays of management. Botulism can also be acquired by inhalation of purified toxin deliberately released in the air."
