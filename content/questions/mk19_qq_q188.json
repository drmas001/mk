") is appropriate prophylaxis before this patient's dental procedure. Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis (IE) is recommended for patients with underlying conditions with the highest risk for an adverse outcome from IE, which do not include heart murmurs associated with native valve abnormalities. Although prophylaxis previously had been widely provided to persons with murmurs before dental procedures, it has been found that the bacteremia associated with dental procedures is much less likely to cause IE than the bacteremia resulting from poor oral hygiene and gingival disease and that only an extremely small number of cases of community-acquired IE are prevented by prophylaxis. Therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is now recommended only for high-risk patients and only when those patients undergo specific procedures in which risk for bacteremia is higher."

"High-risk cardiac conditions include prosthetic cardiac valves, prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair, a history of prior IE, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects or abnormalities, surgical or transcatheter pulmonary valve or conduit placement, and cardiac transplantation with valvulopathy resulting in valvular regurgitation. Endocarditis prophylaxis in high-risk patients is reasonable for dental procedures that involve manipulation of the gingival tissue or periapical region of the teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa. Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent bacterial endocarditis is not recommended for nondental procedures, including transesophageal echocardiography and genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures in the absence of active infection. In patients with an indication for treatment, antibiotics directed toward viridans streptococci are recommended. Oral amoxicillin and, in penicillin-allergic patients, oral cephalexin are recommended. In patients unable to take oral medications, ampicillin, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone can be given intramuscularly or intravenously; in penicillin-allergic patients (nonsevere, nonâ€“IgE-mediated penicillin allergy), cefazolin or ceftriaxone can also be given intramuscularly or intravenously."
