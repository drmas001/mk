"). The most common clinical presentation of a spinal cord infarction involves the anterior spinal artery. Prolonged hypotension during cardiovascular or aortic surgery can result in lack of perfusion to watershed regions of the spinal cord. In this patient, the infarction likely occurred as a consequence of hypoperfusion to the spinal cord vasculature in the anterior arterial vascular distribution in the setting of repair of an aortic dissection. The midportion of the thoracic spinal cord is especially prone to hypoperfusion infarction where the anterior spinal artery from above meets the radicular artery of Adamkiewicz from below. Hypoperfusion in the anterior arterial vascular distribution of the cord typically interrupts both descending motor pathways and the anterior horn cells in the gray matter of the cord, resulting in acute, bilateral, flaccid (low tone, hyporeflexia) paralysis. If sensation is impaired, it will not involve the posterior columns (vibration, position) because of separate vascular supply to the posterior cord."

") is not a likely diagnosis. This inflammatory polyradiculopathy is typified by a subacute onset with progressive ascending paralysis. This patient's acute onset of symptoms is not consistent with the subacute ascending paralysis typical of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Guillain-Barré syndrome also typically occurs as a postinfectious syndrome, and this patient did not experience a preceding infection."

Although this entity could potentially result in a similar set of findings on examination, the time course of an acute onset and the association of the patient's symptoms with concurrent aortic surgery make a vascular cause far more likely than an inflammatory myelitis, which would have a more subacute onset and is typically a postinfectious phenomenon."

Further, such pathology would also likely result in sensory deficits, which this patient is not experiencing."
