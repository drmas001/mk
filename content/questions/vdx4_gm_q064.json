The most common areas of involvement include the scalp (dandruff), nasolabial folds (as seen in this patient), cheeks, and medial eyebrows; the external auditory canals, skin behind the ears, and mid-chest may also be involved. Erythema of the eyelids associated with yellow crusting between the eyelashes (blepharitis) may be the only manifestation of seborrheic dermatitis in some patients."
