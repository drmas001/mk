"). This patient's presentation strongly suggests—but is not diagnostic of—diabetic gastroparesis. Her upper gastrointestinal symptoms and the retained food on upper endoscopy indicate delayed gastric emptying. However, definitive diagnosis of gastroparesis requires objectively demonstrating a delay in gastric emptying. American College of Gastroenterology guidelines state that the diagnosis of gastroparesis must be based on the combination of symptoms of gastroparesis, absence of gastric outlet obstruction or ulceration, and a delay in gastric emptying. Objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying is important because other conditions, such as accelerated gastric emptying, functional dyspepsia, ",

The 4-hour solid-emptying study is preferred over shorter solid-emptying studies or sole liquid-emptying studies because those methods are less sensitive. The most reliable parameter to document a delayed gastric emptying is the percentage of retained gastric contents 4 hours after meal consumption."
