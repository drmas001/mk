"). Urinary incontinence after activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as sneezing, laughing, physical exertion, or bearing down, is consistent with stress incontinence, which primarily affects multiparous, postmenopausal women. This patient has attempted first-line therapy for stress incontinence with pelvic floor muscle training, without success. Vaginal estrogen formulations may increase continence compared with placebo and should be attempted as second-line therapy for postmenopausal women with stress incontinence. Evidence from clinical trials is generally of low quality, and statistical heterogeneity limits confidence in conclusions. However, because this patient is experiencing genitourinary symptoms of menopause (vaginal dryness and dyspareunia), a trial of topical vaginal estrogen is appropriate and reasonable. Weight loss in women with overweight or obesity also improves urinary control in multiple types of incontinence. An 8% decrease in BMI has been shown to reduce incontinence by 50%. This patient, with a BMI of 22, would be unlikely to benefit from weight loss."

Because of the risks associated with systemic hormone replacement therapy (breast cancer, coronary events, stroke, venous thromboembolism), its use should be reserved for vasomotor symptoms of menopause (hot flashes) at the lowest effective dosage for the shortest time required."

If an episode of urgency occurs before the designated voiding time, patients are encouraged to use pelvic floor muscle contraction until the urge passes and then proceed with voiding directly afterward. Timed voiding is a behavioral technique used for patients with urge incontinence (urine leakage preceded by a sudden urge to void) and would not be helpful in this patient with stress incontinence."
