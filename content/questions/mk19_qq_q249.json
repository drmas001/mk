The onset of the visual field defect with a sellar mass is typically gradual. Patients suspected of having a sellar mass should be referred for pituitary MRI with gadolinium contrast. MRI can differentiate between pituitary hemorrhage and a sellar mass, and it can define the relationship between the mass and surrounding tissues."

Eye movement abnormalities in multiple sclerosis include abnormalities of voluntary gaze and nystagmus. These abnormalities present as diplopia or oscillopsia. Multiple sclerosis does not commonly affect the optic chiasm."
