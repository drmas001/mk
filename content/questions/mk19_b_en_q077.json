"). Screening for primary hyperaldosteronism in patients with hypertension is recommended if any of the following are present: resistant hypertension, hypokalemia (spontaneous or substantial, if diuretic induced), incidentally discovered adrenal mass, family history of early-onset hypertension, or stroke at younger than 40 years. The most reliable case-detection test is calculation of plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC)/PRA by measuring PAC and PRA (or direct renin concentration) in a midmorning seated sample. In patients taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, PRA should be elevated; therefore, a simple initial test in these patients is a PRA measurement. If PRA is suppressed, the likelihood of primary aldosteronism is high and then PAC/PRA should be calculated; if PRA is elevated, hyperaldosteronism is ruled out. This patient is taking losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, and the initial test can be a PRA measurement."

"); however, this test is often impractical. The preferred alternative is a spot urine potassium-creatinine ratio. A value lower than 13 mEq/g identifies hypokalemia secondary to lack of intake, transcellular shifts, or gastrointestinal losses. However, this patient is not hypokalemic, and urine studies for potassium loss are not helpful in screening for primary hypoaldosteronism."
