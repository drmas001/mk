"A 71-year-old woman is evaluated for metastatic colon cancer. Stage III colon cancer was diagnosed and treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy 3 years ago. The tumor was found to be mismatch repair–deficient. Evaluation for a germline mismatch repair protein deficiency (Lynch syndrome) was negative. Six months ago, she was found to have numerous hepatic metastases and involvement of multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes. She was treated with a standard chemotherapy regimen and was stable for 4 months. Current CT imaging shows tumor growth in the liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The patient remains asymptomatic with good performance status."

"). Tumors may be mismatch repair–deficient either due to a germline mutation, a condition known as Lynch syndrome, or a somatic mutation (or epigenetic silencing) that is limited to the tumor. Because mismatch repair–deficient tumors carry a better prognosis than the more common mismatch repair–proficient tumors, mismatch repair–deficient tumors rarely become metastatic and comprise only 3% to 4% of all metastatic colorectal cancer cases. Patients in this rare subset, however, have shown substantial benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically PD-1 inhibitors. Unfortunately for most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (>95%) whose tumors are mismatch repair–proficient, PD-1 inhibitors and other immune checkpoint inhibitors have thus far been essentially inactive."
