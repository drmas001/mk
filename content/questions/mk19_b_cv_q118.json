Her symptoms have become life limiting despite adherence to a structured exercise program. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She has a 60-pack-year smoking history and quit 1 year ago. Medications are aspirin, metformin, canagliflozin, cilostazol, atorvastatin, and olmesartan."

"). This patient with peripheral artery disease (PAD) has quit smoking, been adherent to a supervised exercise program, and been treated with aspirin, cilostazol, and atorvastatin; despite these interventions, she remains symptomatic, with lifestyle-limiting claudication. She is therefore a candidate for revascularization, and because she has worse symptoms and a lower ankle-brachial index on the left, revascularization should be targeted to the left leg. Experienced vascular specialists can accomplish recanalization with angioplasty, atherectomy, stenting, and/or a combination of techniques. Aortobifemoral bypass surgery is reserved for patients with severe aortoiliac stenoses. Aortoiliac disease most typically manifests as buttock, hip, and, in some cases, thigh claudication."

"In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists reduce the rates of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, and, in the case of SGLT2 inhibitors, heart failure hospitalizations. These classes of drugs are recommended as part of the glucose-lowering regimen in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk for ASCVD. The American College of Cardiology recommends that canagliflozin be used with caution in patients with prior amputation, severe peripheral neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or active diabetic foot infections. In this patient, revascularization will improve her symptoms, whereas stopping canagliflozin (",

"A small study showed that patients with intermittent claudication treated with ramipril had an improvement in pain-free walking time and maximal walking time compared with patients treated with usual care. However, there have not been additional studies that have shown ramipril or other ACE inhibitors to be associated with improvements in functional capacity or symptoms in patients with PAD. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be effective in reducing cardiac events in patients with PAD, and there are no data showing preference for one over the others.
