"). She has a tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction greater than 15 mm, indicating a positive result. However, she has no signs of active tuberculosis infection (normal chest radiograph and no clinical findings), so treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) should be initiated. Short-course treatment regimens with rifamycins are recommended over longer (6- to 9-month) courses. In persons without HIV infection, other preferred regimens include isoniazid and rifapentine once weekly for 3 months or rifampin daily for 4 months. Alternatively, daily isoniazid alone for 6 or 9 months is now considered a second-line treatment option; it carries a higher toxicity risk and lower completion rate than short-course regimens. Short-course treatment regimens are also recommended for LTBI in patients with HIV infection; these include isoniazid and rifapentine once weekly for 3 months or isoniazid plus rifampin daily for 3 months in patients who are not taking antiretroviral therapy that interacts with rifapentine."
