She fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of fatigue of at least 6 months' duration with substantial reduction in pre-illness activities, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive impairment. She reports no pain, depressed mood, anhedonia, snoring, or daytime hypersomnolence. Medical history is significant for migraine and irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea. Medications are sumatriptan, topiramate, loperamide, and nortriptyline."

") is the most appropriate treatment for this patient with symptoms consistent with systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. The diagnosis of SEID, based on criteria from the Institute of Medicine, requires the presence of fatigue of at least 6 months' duration with substantial reduction in pre-illness activities, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and either cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Although the pathophysiology of SEID remains unclear, the syndrome is often triggered by a prodromal event, such as an infection. Comorbid conditions, including fibromyalgia, mood disturbances, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis, are often present. Management of SEID is supportive and focuses on treatment of symptoms and comorbid conditions. Pacing strategies, in which specific limits are placed on the degree of exertion, are used to reduce the frequency of postexertional malaise."
