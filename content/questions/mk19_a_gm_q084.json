"). Pain from rotator cuff disease is frequently localized to the upper arm near the deltoid insertion; is worsened with overhead activities; and is often worse at night, particularly when lying on the affected side. Many examination maneuvers are available for rotator cuff disease assessment. The painful arc test consists of the patient performing full abduction of the arm; pain that occurs between 60 degrees and 120 degrees supports the diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy. The painful arc test has the highest positive likelihood ratio (3.7) of all testing maneuvers for rotator cuff tendinopathy. A rotator cuff tear should be suspected when the pain is complicated by weakness in external rotation or abduction or the patient is unable to lower the arm smoothly from a fully abducted position (positive drop arm test). Rotator cuff tendinopathy is more common in patients older than 50 years who have repetitive overhead stress to the shoulder. Initial therapy includes rest, acetaminophen, and physical therapy to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles and improve flexibility."
