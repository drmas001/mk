Closure of the PDA is indicated in patients with left-sided cardiac chamber enlargement as long as pulmonary artery systolic pressure is less than 50% systemic, even in the absence of symptoms. Closure may be considered in patients with some degree of pulmonary hypertension in selected cases (pulmonary artery pressure 50%-66% systemic). Percutaneous closure is usually performed; referral to a congenital cardiac center for consideration of closure options is recommended. PDA closure should be avoided in patients with irreversible pulmonary vascular disease. PDA closure in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure >66% systemic) is associated with greater risk compared with PDA closure in those without pulmonary hypertension and is not associated with improved survival. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, the existence of right-to-left ductal shunting may be necessary to maintain cardiac output, and closure may result in clinical worsening."
