"). Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend first assessing the patient for the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, which may include known CAD, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. In the absence of risk factors, the patient can proceed to surgery without additional evaluation. In patients with CAD risk factors, the estimated risk for a major adverse cardiac event should be calculated using a validated risk assessment tool. Patients with low calculated cardiovascular risk (<1%) may proceed to surgery without additional evaluation, whereas patients with elevated risk (≥1%) should have functional capacity assessed. Metabolic equivalents are used to represent a patient's functional capacity based on the intensity of activity the patient can perform. If functional capacity exceeds four metabolic equivalents, the patient may proceed to surgery without further testing. The Duke Activity Status Index score is a standardized and accurate means of estimating functional capacity and outperforms unaided physician judgement, including asking a patient how fast they can walk, or if they can run, climb a hill, or climb stairs."
