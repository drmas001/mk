"). Based on this patient's age, sex, and clinical findings (diffuse thyromegaly, thyroid bruit, and elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin), the most likely cause of her hyperthyroidism is Graves disease. Treatment is typically with medical management. PTU, rather than methimazole, is the drug of choice during the first trimester. Although rare, methimazole has been associated with fetal development of aplasia cutis (absence of a portion of skin on the scalp in a localized or widespread area) and choanal atresia (blockage of the posterior nasal passage due to failed recanalization of the nasal fossae during fetal development) when used in the first trimester. Once organogenesis is complete, methimazole can be substituted for PTU. However, switching between antithyroid drugs in the middle of pregnancy may precipitate decompensation of control and thus must be carried out cautiously."

") is typically the preferred agent in nonpregnant patients with hyperthyroidism because it has a longer intrathyroidal half-life than PTU and usually can be administered once daily. There is also an increased risk for severe liver toxicity with PTU. Regardless of the antithyroid drug used, the lowest effective dosage should be administered during pregnancy to prevent fetal hypothyroidism."
