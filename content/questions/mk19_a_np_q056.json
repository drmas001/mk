"). Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure (BP) that remains above goal despite concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes, or BP at goal but requiring four or more medications. One of these medications must be a diuretic. Suboptimal antihypertensive therapy in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension is frequently the result of not including a diuretic agent, which ensures that extracellular volume expansion is prevented or treated. Therefore, before a diagnosis of resistant hypertension is made or evaluation is initiated for secondary causes of hypertension, the patient should be treated with an appropriate diuretic medication, with attention to effective dose and dosing frequency. Although hydrochlorothiazide is the most commonly used thiazide diuretic, chlorthalidone has a longer half-life, which allows once-daily dosing; some evidence from trials suggests efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events."
