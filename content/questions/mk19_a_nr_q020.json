She also reports fluctuating weakness and frequent nausea and diarrhea. She has had a history of exercise intolerance and intermittent muscle cramps since middle school. She also has postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Her sister, brother, mother, and maternal aunt have similar muscle, neurologic, and multiorgan symptoms, but her father and a second brother do not. Current medications are propranolol and duloxetine."

"). Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders caused by dysfunction of the mitochondria and may present as myopathies, neuropathies, and multisystemic diseases with maternal inheritance. Maternal inheritance is a unique and distinctive feature of mitochondrial DNA. Offspring of affected fathers do not inherit these diseases, but all offspring regardless of sex are at equal risk for inheriting the disease when a mother possesses the mutation. Each cell carries multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome and deleterious mutations usually affect some but not all copies of the mitochondrial genome. The expression of disease due to mitochondrial DNA depends on the relative proportions of normal and abnormal mitochondrial DNA. This means that there can be substantial variation in the likelihood of developing the disease and the disease severity. In this case, three of the offspring are affected because of this variable expression of disease. Mitochondrial disorders can present with a wide range of fluctuating symptoms, including weakness, autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal motility disorders, chronic pain, vision and hearing disorders, and cardiovascular disease. In this patient, fluctuating weakness, ophthalmoplegia, multiorgan symptoms, and family history should prompt consideration of mitochondrial myopathy."

The clinical course is milder than that of related Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and these patients are sometimes seen in an adult clinic. Because of X-linked transmission, this condition is not expected in a female patient even though female carriers of dystrophin gene may develop hyperCKemia or nocturnal cramps. In addition, a fluctuating course, ophthalmoplegia, and multiorgan involvement (except for the heart) are not expected in this disorder."
