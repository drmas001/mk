"), oxybutynin, darifenacin, solifenacin, fesoterodine, or trospium for his lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). LUTS can be grouped into irritative symptoms (urinary urgency with or without urinary incontinence, increasing daytime frequency, and nocturia) and obstructive symptoms (hesitancy, weak urinary stream, straining, incomplete voiding, urinary retention, and overflow incontinence). This patient was appropriately initially treated with tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is the most common cause of LUTS in men. However, the persistence of symptoms, absence of bladder outlet obstruction on urodynamic studies and bladder ultrasonography, and presence of irritative symptoms points to overactive bladder as the diagnosis. Medical treatment is aimed at reducing involuntary detrusor contractions during filling of the bladder. Because no evidence of postvoid residuals was found, it is safe to initiate a trial of an anticholinergic medication, such as tolterodine, in this patient. The combination of the α-blocker (such as tamsulosin) and an anticholinergic agent (such as tolterodine) is more effective in treating LUTS than monotherapy with either drug."

Efficacy data consistently demonstrates improved symptoms for patients with LUTS following treatment with an α-blocker."
