"), provide sustained airway dilation. When added to therapy in patients with asthma that is not controlled with inhaled glucocorticoid/LABA combination therapy, tiotropium has been shown to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations. For patients with significant adverse effects from LABAs, a LAMA can reasonably be substituted. However, there is no substantial evidence that LAMAs instead of LABAs should be the first choice for long-acting airway dilation in patients with asthma. There is no evidence that a LAMA, as a single therapeutic agent, is effective in preventing EIB."
