"). This patient has signs and symptoms of pituitary apoplexy (sudden hemorrhage or infarction of a pituitary adenoma). Pituitary apoplexy occurs in 2% to 12% of patients with pituitary tumors and is a medical emergency. The presentation of pituitary apoplexy varies in severity and may include severe headache, endocrine abnormalities such as hypocortisolemia and hyponatremia, diplopia caused by pressure on the oculomotor nerves, and vision changes caused by mass effect. The diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy is based on the clinical signs and symptoms and supported by the MRI findings. If visual loss is present, urgent neurosurgical consultation should be obtained regarding the need to decompress the optic apparatus to preserve or restore vision."

Because free thyroxine has a long half-life, it is unlikely to show evidence of secondary hypothyroidism for several weeks. If a patient with pituitary apoplexy does require thyroid hormone treatment, it should be started at least 24 hours after initiation of hydrocortisone replacement for concomitant adrenal insufficiency to avoid precipitating adrenal crisis."

Likely causes of this patient's low sodium level include hypocortisolemia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion resulting from inappropriate release of vasopressin or lack of cortisol suppression. However, the diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion first requires exclusion of adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism. In this patient with potential adrenal insufficiency, sodium levels should be assessed frequently."
