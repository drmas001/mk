"), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Pharmacotherapy is an option in the treatment of obesity and overweight for patients with BMI of 30 or greater or for those with BMI of 27 or greater and at least one obesity-associated comorbid condition (such as diabetes, hypertension, or obstructive sleep apnea) who have not achieved weight loss goals with a trial of at least 3 to 6 months of lifestyle modification. Pharmacotherapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, and women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy while using these medications. The goal of pharmacotherapy is weight loss of 5% or more during the first 3 to 6 months. If this target is not reached, use of the medication should be discontinued. Weight is typically regained once pharmacotherapy is discontinued, which underscores the importance of concomitant lifestyle changes. The potential weight loss benefit of pharmacotherapy should be balanced against risk for adverse events and cost. Liraglutide in an injectable agent that acts to decrease gastric emptying, thereby increasing satiety, and has been associated with weight loss of 5.2 kg (11.6 lb) compared with placebo. Contraindications include a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma and family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and it should be used cautiously in patients with pancreatitis. Of the pharmacologic treatment options, liraglutide is the weight loss medication most likely to be well tolerated in this patient."

The most common adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, changes in bowel habits, and insomnia. Contraindications include seizure disorders, eating disorders, any current opiate use or withdrawal, or any risky alcohol use. Because this patient has insomnia, this drug combination would be a poor choice."
