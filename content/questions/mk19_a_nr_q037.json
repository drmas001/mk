"). The incidence of statin-induced muscle symptoms is no greater than 1%, and the incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is less than 0.1%. Statin-induced myopathy manifests as unexplained muscle pain or weakness with an increase in the creatine kinase (CK) level up to 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is a more severely symptomatic form of myopathy with CK levels typically greater than 40 times the ULN. Most patients experience statin-induced myopathy within the first year of therapy after a dose increase or the addition of an interacting drug. Most drugs that interact with statins increase the statin blood concentration and the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. The typical clinical presentation consists of symmetric muscle pain and weakness, but nonspecific lower back pain has been reported as a feature of statin-induced myopathy. The serum CK level should be measured in patients taking a statin who develop muscle pain or weakness. Delay in making the diagnosis (and stopping the statin) can lead to rhabdomyolysis and possibly acute kidney injury. Discontinuation of the statin most commonly results in a rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of the serum CK level."
