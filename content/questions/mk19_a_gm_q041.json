Her treatment course was complicated by radiation-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw. Medical history also includes hypertension and anxiety. Medications are amlodipine, chlorthalidone, immediate-release morphine (20 mg daily), bupropion, and lorazepam."

") with an opioid, in this case morphine, poses the greatest risk for overdose and death in this patient. Major risk factors for opioid overdose include receiving more than 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day and receiving opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently. In this situation, the best risk mitigation strategy is modifying the therapeutic regimen by tapering and then discontinuing lorazepam. If this cannot be done or cannot be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time, a naloxone reversal kit should be prescribed. Current recommendations are to prescribe naloxone to any patient who is receiving more than 50 MME per day, as well as to patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently. Naloxone also should be considered for patients taking opioids with risk factors for opioid-related harms, such as elderly persons; patients with mental health conditions; and patients at risk for sleep-disordered breathing, such as those with heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, or obesity. Household members should be informed about naloxone administration and overdose prevention."
