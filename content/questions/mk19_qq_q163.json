") is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the JC polyomavirus (JCV). It occurs almost exclusively in severely immunocompromised patients, including those with advanced AIDS. Clinical findings of PML include dementia, hemiparesis or paralysis of one extremity, ataxia, hemianopsia, and diplopia. The characteristic appearance of these lesions on MRI is hyperintense (white) areas on T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences and hypointense (dark) areas on T1-weighted images. There is usually no mass effect. Among patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, the probability of PML exceeds 80% in those with white matter lesions with no mass effect. The treatment approach involves initiation of antiretroviral therapy to reverse the immunosuppression that interferes with the normal host response to JCV."
