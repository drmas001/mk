Optimal duration of use is unknown, but current recommendations suggest reassessing fracture risk and need for ongoing therapy after 5 to 10 years of use. This patient's fracture risk is no longer high; thus, discontinuation of denosumab is appropriate. The effects of denosumab on BMD, however, are transient, and alternative antiresorptive therapy to prevent loss of accrued BMD should be initiated on discontinuation of denosumab."

Although intravenous bisphosphonates may be used beginning 6 months after the last denosumab treatment, intermittent oral bisphosphonate administration throughout the period of denosumab withdrawal is advantageous. Bisphosphonates are preferentially taken up into bone at sites of active bone remodeling, making optimal timing of intravenous bisphosphonate dosing unclear."

Raloxifene should be avoided in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease but may be useful in women at high risk for breast cancer because it reduces the risk for invasive breast cancer."

However, teriparatide accentuates the increased bone resorption and rapid loss of BMD associated with denosumab withdrawal; thus, it should not be substituted for denosumab."
