"), commonly known as sciatica. One quarter to one third of women experience some hip pain during pregnancy; the most common causes are sciatica, sacroiliitis, and round ligament pain. Hip pain in pregnancy is caused by a combination of factors, including an enlarging uterus, which increases the mechanical load to the hip joints, and loosening or laxity of the ligaments of the sacroiliac joints due to relaxin and estrogens, which contribute to joint hypermobility and widening of the symphysis pubis, which in turn alters the pelvic architecture. Sciatic nerve compression in the lumbosacral spine leads to pain, tingling, and numbness that radiate into the leg."

"), or inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, may occur as an isolated musculoskeletal condition or as part of a spondyloarthritis. Pregnancy, leg length discrepancies, scoliosis, and lumbar fixation increase risk for sacroiliitis. On physical examination, there is pain with palpation of the sacroiliac joint; however, passive range of motion is unaffected, and straight and contralateral leg raise tests produce no pain. The diagnosis of sacroiliitis is more likely with a positive FABER test, in which pain is reproduced when the hip is Flexed, ABducted, and Externally Rotated."
