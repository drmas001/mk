"). The characteristic murmur of valvular AR is a blowing diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best at the left third and fourth interspaces with the patient sitting and leaning forward. This patient's physical examination is consistent with severe AR, as evidenced by a Corrigan pulse in the carotid arteries (rapid, accentuated upstroke with a rapid decline), displaced apical impulse, and widened pulse pressure. AR is generally asymptomatic for a long time (possibly decades) until signs and symptoms of heart failure develop due to cardiac remodeling from chronic volume overload. Angina also may manifest because of subendocardial ischemia related to increased wall tension or reduced coronary perfusion pressure from reduced diastolic pressures. Congenital valve abnormalities (such as bicuspid aortic valve), rheumatic heart disease, abnormalities of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta, prior infective endocarditis, or injury from prior radiation therapy may cause chronic AR."

When mitral valvular obstruction is present, auscultatory findings are similar to those of mitral stenosis (mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex); however, findings may vary with position or be associated with an early diastolic sound, known as the tumor plop. This patient's findings do not support a diagnosis of atrial myxoma."
