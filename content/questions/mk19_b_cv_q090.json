"). This patient's examination findings (late-peaking crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border, crackles, and elevated central venous pressure) and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level are consistent with significant aortic stenosis and associated volume overload. On echocardiography, low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis is suggested by a severely reduced valve area (≤1.0 cm",
{
"type":"tag",
"tagName":"sup",
"attrs":{
},
"children":[
"2"
]
},
") and a modestly increased peak aortic velocity (<4 m/s) in the setting of a reduced ejection fraction (<50%). The most appropriate next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis with low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography. If dobutamine infusion results in an increase in stroke volume by at least 20%, severe aortic stenosis is diagnosed by an increase in peak velocity to 4.0 m/s or greater with the valve area remaining 1.0 cm",
