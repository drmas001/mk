"). This patient presents with widespread pain, fatigue, poor sleep, and cognitive symptoms of 1 year's duration. These symptoms are the hallmarks of fibromyalgia, a poorly understood but common chronic pain syndrome affecting 2% to 3% of the population. Diagnosis is suggested by history and can be confirmed with validated criteria (e.g., the 2016 revisions to the American College of Rheumatology Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria). This illness is not autoimmune or inflammatory, and extensive laboratory testing is not advised unless another comorbid disease is suggested. Although some patients may have tender points, assessment of tender points on examination is unreliable (particularly in men) and no longer among the clinical criteria for diagnosis. Fibromyalgia tends to be associated with other medically unexplained syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, and is especially common in patients with migraine headaches."
