") would best predict surgery-related morbidity and mortality and should be performed in this patient to identify increased risk. Frailty is a multifactorial state of decreased physiologic reserves and increased vulnerability to stressors. In persons older than 65 years, the estimated incidence of frailty is 10% to 20% and increases with each decade. Standardized indices to objectively measure frailty include the Frailty Index, the frailty phenotype, the FRAIL (Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of weight) scale, and the Osteoporotic Fractures Frailty Scale. The FRAIL scale is the easiest to administer and score. In the perioperative period, frailty is associated with higher rates of complications, prolonged hospital stays, and increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Frailty is a risk factor for poor surgical outcomes, and thus it is important to engage the frail patient and family in conversations around decision making before elective surgeries. A frailty assessment may inform discussions with the patient and family regarding surgical techniques, pre- and postoperative strategies to minimize risk, and likely outcomes."

Multiple studies have shown that chest radiographs are usually not effective at predicting postoperative outcomes or changing perioperative management. When abnormal findings are noted, they typically could have been predicted through history and physical examination."

However, ECG abnormalities in older patients are common, with a prevalence of 75% in one observational study, but are not associated with cardiac events and do not predict perioperative morbidity or mortality. Risk scores, such the Revised Cardiac Risk Index score and others, do predict perioperative morbidity and mortality."

Furthermore, evidence does not support a spirometric threshold below which the risk of surgery is unacceptable and spirometry is a poor predictor of morbidity or mortality. Spirometry might be helpful in patients with obstructive airways disease if there is suspicion that the patient is not optimally treated; the presence of reversible airflow obstruction suggests the need for more aggressive therapy."
