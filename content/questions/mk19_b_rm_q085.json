"). This patient has polymyalgia rheumatica, and 10% to 20% of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica have concomitant GCA at presentation or develop GCA later in the disease course. Headache is present in more than 60% of patients with GCA and may be frontal, occipital, unilateral, or generalized; it may be constant, intermittent, or waxing and waning. The important point is that the headache is new. A frequent nonheadache manifestation of GCA is jaw claudication, owing to decreased blood flow to the muscles of mastication. Jaw claudication is found in nearly 50% of patients with GCA, and this symptom should always be explored on review of systems in a patient with polymyalgia rheumatica. Other key questions to ask such patients include whether they have recent changes in vision (e.g., short-lived episodes of amaurosis fugax, diplopia, or blurriness) and scalp tenderness (e.g., with hair brushing). A blood C-reactive protein level of 12.8 mg/dL (128 mg/L) would be unusual for polymyalgia rheumatica alone; this degree of systemic inflammation is more in keeping with a vasculitis, such as GCA."

The patient does not have this symptom complex, making polyarteritis nodosa an unlikely diagnosis."
