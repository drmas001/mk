Typical findings include deficits in short-term memory and processing speed, although almost any domain can be impaired.

"Depressive symptoms are frequently encountered in patients with chronic medical disease either as a result of the illness itself (such as hypothyroidism) or as a response to the disability caused by the illness. Depression commonly accompanies many medical conditions, including neurologic conditions (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease), cancer, heart failure, and HIV infection. For initial acute therapy, guidelines recommend either cognitive behavioral therapy or second-generation antidepressants such as venlafaxine (",
