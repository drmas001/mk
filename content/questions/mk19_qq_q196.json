") is the most appropriate next step in management. Information about otitis media in adults is sparse, and clinical guidance is provided by studies performed mainly in children and adolescents. Patients with OME frequently present with aural fullness and a conductive hearing loss. Otoscopic examination shows clear or yellowish fluid present behind an intact tympanic membrane. Most cases resolve without treatment within 12 weeks. OME and acute otitis media are associated with eustachian tube dysfunction, which impairs drainage and causes retention of fluid in the middle ear. Eustachian tube dysfunction often occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection or with exacerbation of seasonal allergies, as in this patient."
