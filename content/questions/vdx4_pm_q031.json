" on this frontal chest radiograph most likely suggest lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is defined by the presence of tumor within pulmonary lymphatics. The frontal radiograph shows bilateral prominent interstitial markings. Also seen here is a moderate left and small right pleural effusion, as well as hilar lymphadenopathy (",

Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's past history of breast cancer, presenting symptoms, and radiographic findings."
