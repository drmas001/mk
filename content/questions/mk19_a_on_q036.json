"). Unfavorable prognostic factors for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma include the presence of a large mediastinal mass, an elevated sedimentation rate, involvement of multiple nodal sites, extranodal involvement, age 50 years and older, or massive splenic disease. The combination of chemotherapy and irradiation is associated with a high rate of cure in early-stage disease, even with adverse prognostic features. Using both modalities in combination has allowed for high cure rates while using shorter courses of chemotherapy (two to four cycles) and lower cumulative doses of radiation given to smaller fields, thus minimizing the potential for long-term toxicities. Chemotherapy alone could also be an appropriate option for this patient, avoiding irradiation entirely, if she has a complete metabolic response by interim PET/CT after two to three cycles of treatment (risk-adapted therapy). Avoiding radiation therapy may be associated with a slightly higher risk of relapse but avoids the risk of late radiation therapy–induced toxicities."

Thus, essentially all patients with early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma currently receive chemotherapy as part of their treatment."
