"). Drivers older than 65 years are associated with more traffic fatalities than any other group of drivers older than 25 years. Older drivers are at risk for accumulating deficits in multiple areas that affect driving safety, including vision, cognition, and mobility. However, driving is a highly valued instrumental activity of daily living, and cessation of driving is associated with social isolation and depression. The decision to discontinue driving is thus a complex and somewhat subjective assessment that often requires partnering between the patient, family, and clinician. If modifiable risk factors for driving safety are present, interventions to address those risk factors with subsequent reassessment may be an appropriate strategy. In this case, the patient has an abnormal result on the Mini-Cog test. The Mini-Cog is sensitive (76%-100%) but not highly specific (54%-85%) in the diagnosis of dementia. On the basis of this patient's history of MVCs and cognitive impairment, a recommendation to retire from driving is appropriate. This recommendation should be accompanied by a discussion of future transportation, including resources that can be provided by the family and a referral to community resources that would allow her to live independently and continue participating in social activities that are important to her."
