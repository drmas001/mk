"). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care settings in adults aged 18 years or older, including pregnant women, and providing persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking with brief behavioral counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use. Unhealthy alcohol use is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Individuals with unhealthy alcohol use often interact with the health care system but rarely receive appropriate treatment. Screening instruments to identify harmful drinking include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C), and Single Alcohol Screening Question (SASQ). The AUDIT is a validated 10-item screening test that takes approximately 2 to 3 minutes to administer; the AUDIT-C is a briefer (three-item) version of the AUDIT. With single-item screening, the clinician asks, “How many times in the past year have you had five [four for women and persons aged >65 years] or more drinks in 1 day?” Patients with a positive screening result should be evaluated for alcohol use disorder and medical complications of excessive alcohol intake."

This patient has no indication for thyroid function screening."
