"). The American Diabetes Association recommends a patient-centered approach to guide the choice of pharmacologic agents. In patients without cardiovascular disease or at high risk for cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, the choice of a second or third agent to add to metformin is not evidence-based. Instead, drug choice is based on avoidance of adverse effects, particularly hypoglycemia and weight gain, cost, and patient preferences. Treatment regimens must be continuously reviewed for efficacy, adverse effects, and patient burden. Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion regardless of glycemic status, and they often cause hypoglycemia and are associated with weight gain.
