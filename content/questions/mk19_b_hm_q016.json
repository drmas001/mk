"A 45-year-old man is evaluated for an acute stroke. He was hospitalized 48 hours ago following a motor vehicle accident in which he sustained several fractures requiring internal fixation. Further surgery is scheduled. Twenty-four hours ago, he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, and full-dose unfractionated heparin was started. Neurologic symptoms have developed over the past 30 minutes. Before hospitalization, he was taking no medications."

"). He has developed a potentially life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage requiring cessation and reversal of the unfractionated heparin. Unfractionated heparin binds to antithrombin and inactivates thrombin and factor Xa. Dosing is based on the activated partial thromboplastin time. Bioavailability varies and reaching a therapeutic level can take time, so unfractionated heparin is not the best option for most hospitalized patients with an acute thrombosis; however, because of its short half-life, it remains the ideal treatment for those patients with an acute thrombosis in whom low-molecular-weight-heparin (half-life 4.5-7 hours) is contraindicated, such as those at increased risk of bleeding or patients with planned surgical intervention. Major bleeding occurs in 3% of patients taking heparin. In a patient with life-threatening bleeding, the heparin infusion should be stopped immediately, followed by protamine sulfate administration at a dose of 1 mg per 100 units of heparin administered in the previous 2 hours."
