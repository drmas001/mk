"), a limited cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis. This patient has a vasculitic rash, with a large crop of petechiae and palpable purpura. The appearance of the rash suggests small-vessel rather than medium-vessel involvement (for example, there are no subcutaneous nodules or necrosis). Several types of small-vessel vasculitis can affect the skin. The first step in the evaluation of a cutaneous vasculitis is to determine whether systemic symptoms or findings are present. In this case, no findings suggest a systemic illness. The physical examination is unremarkable aside from the rash, and results of laboratory testing are similarly unrevealing. This strongly suggests that the diagnosis is hypersensitivity vasculitis. This condition is often triggered by medications (thiazide diuretics are among the most frequent culprits) or infections, although about 50% of patients have no known precipitant. Drug-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis most often occurs 7 to 10 days after the introduction of a new medication, and recovery is likely with discontinuation of the drug. If symptoms persist or recur, anti-inflammatory agents, topical or low-dose systemic glucocorticoids, colchicine, or dapsone may be helpful."

"). This systemic small-vessel vasculitis invariably involves the lungs (usually with a prodromal phase of rhinitis and asthma and other pulmonary manifestations with disease progression) and often affects the peripheral nervous system and skin. Laboratory testing reveals the presence of ANCA antibodies (myeloperoxidase subtype) about half the time, and peripheral eosinophilia is expected."

Although it can present with palpable purpura, as in small-vessel vasculitis, other skin findings indicating medium-vessel involvement would be present (e.g., livedo reticularis, subcutaneous nodules, painful deep ulcers, or skin necrosis). This patient has no other features of polyarteritis nodosa, such as constitutional and musculoskeletal symptoms, peripheral nervous system involvement, or gastrointestinal disease."
