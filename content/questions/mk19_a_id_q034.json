Because the treatment duration is long, generally 6 weeks, and the risk of adverse events is high, especially in older patients, every effort should be made to ensure that the antibiotic selected is optimal for the organism causing the infection. If blood cultures return positive for a typical pathogen, the need for biopsy could be reassessed. If neurologic compromise or radiographic evidence of spinal instability were present, urgent surgical intervention may be needed."
