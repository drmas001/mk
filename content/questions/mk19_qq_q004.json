"). This patient has symptoms suggestive of delayed gastric emptying, which is characterized by nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, postprandial fullness, and abdominal pain. A loud succussion splash is associated with retained air and gastric fluid. It is auscultated with the stethoscope over the upper abdomen when the patient is rocked or the abdomen is palpated. Delayed gastric emptying can be due to either a mechanical gastric outlet obstruction or gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a neuromuscular disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It is most commonly idiopathic, but other common causes are diabetes, drugs, and surgery. In this patient, the use of ibuprofen could have caused peptic ulceration with outlet obstruction due to inflammation and/or scarring. In all patients, the initial diagnostic test is upper endoscopy to exclude gastric outlet obstruction. Once a structural cause for symptoms has been excluded, a test to assess gastric emptying (such as gastric scintigraphy, wireless motility capsule, or radiolabeled carbon breath test) is performed. Gastric scintigraphy is used most commonly. Once delayed emptying is confirmed, additional testing may be required to determine the underlying cause of the gastroparesis."
