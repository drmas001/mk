"). Acute CPP crystal arthritis is an episodic arthritis that most commonly occurs in older women. It usually develops over several days and may last for weeks. The knee and wrists are common sites. The presentation is usually inflammatory, with pain, swelling, and warmth of the involved joint. Systemic markers of inflammation may be elevated, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in this patient. Plain radiographs, like the one shown for this patient, may demonstrate chondrocalcinosis. Chondrocalcinosis is seen as a thin white line that tracks below the surface layer of the cartilage because it represents CPP deposition within the cartilage. A definitive diagnosis would include aspiration of the joint fluid and the demonstration of CPP crystals, which are weakly positively birefringent (blue when parallel to and yellow when perpendicular to the polarizing axis of an optical filter) and classically rhomboid-shaped."

") is a less likely diagnosis given the involvement of the knee without current or prior typical joint involvement (first metatarsophalangeal joint, forefeet, ankles, and fingers). The 3-week duration of the previous episodes is longer than that usually seen with gout (1-2 weeks). The normal serum urate level also makes gout unlikely, although serum urate levels may occasionally fall into the normal range during an acute flare. Monosodium urate crystals are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent under polarized light; they appear yellow when parallel and blue when perpendicular to the polarizing axis."

") is unlikely because the patient has no fever or other systemic symptoms after 10 days, as well as a normal complete blood count. Her history of similar episodes also argues against infection as the cause. Nevertheless, all patients with acute monoarticular arthritis should undergo synovial fluid analysis that includes a Gram stain and culture to help exclude infectious arthritis."
