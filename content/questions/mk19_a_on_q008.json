"). Patients with early cervical cancer are frequently asymptomatic. The most common symptoms are abnormal or heavy vaginal bleeding or vaginal discharge. Pelvic or back pain and bowel or bladder symptoms are presentations of advanced disease. Diagnosis is made by direct biopsy of a visible lesion, colposcopy, or cone biopsy (conization). The 5-year relative survival for all stages of cervical cancer is 67.5%. The anatomic stage is the most important predictor of prognosis. Ninety percent of patients with localized disease survive 5 years. The 5-year survival rate drops to 58% for patients with regional disease and 17% for patients with disease extending outside of the true pelvis or involving the bladder or rectum. Stage III cervical cancer extends to the pelvic sidewall and/or involves the lower third of the vagina and/or causes hydronephrosis or a nonfunctioning kidney. This patient's tumor extends to the pelvic sidewall. The addition of platinum chemotherapy to radiation therapy in this setting reduces the risk of recurrence by 34% and improves overall survival versus treatment with radiation alone (",

"). Peripheral sensory neuropathy is a common adverse effect of platinum chemotherapy, and patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Patients with preexisting diabetic neuropathy may be more likely to experience worsened neuropathy as a result of chemotherapy. In the absence of more severe peripheral sensory neuropathy, platinum chemotherapy should be incorporated into treatment, given the associated improvement in outcomes."
