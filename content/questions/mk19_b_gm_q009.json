He has been unsuccessful in losing weight despite several weight loss diets, including structured meal plans, nutritionist referral, and weight loss medications. He walks 15 minutes daily but finds exercise difficult because of joint pain. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. Medications are metformin, empagliflozin, liraglutide, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, topical diclofenac, and acetaminophen. He uses continuous positive airway pressure ventilation at night."

"). Bariatric surgery is indicated for motivated individuals with BMI of 40 or greater or BMI of 35 or greater and at least one serious weight-related comorbid condition, such as obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, or type 2 diabetes. Additional criteria for bariatric surgery include sustained unsuccessful weight loss attempts using high-intensity lifestyle modification programs, structured meal plans, and/or pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery reliably results in weight loss and may also produce improvements in diabetes control, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Cardiovascular and overall mortality may also be improved in patients with severe obesity. It may also durably improve or reverse some of the medical complications associated with obesity, such as obstructive sleep apnea and osteoarthritis. Patients should have acceptable operative risk, understand the necessity of lifelong dietary and lifestyle measures for sustained weight loss, and be willing to adhere to lifelong follow-up. Candidates should not have psychological conditions that impede adherence to these requirements."
