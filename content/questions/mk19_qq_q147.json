"O). The appropriate kidney response to hyperosmolality is to retain free water, which results in urine osmolality greater than serum osmolality. This response is not seen in this patient (urine osmolality is low compared with serum osmolality); therefore, she has either DI or osmotic diuresis. Patients with hyperosmolality who have submaximally concentrated urine without evidence of osmotic diuresis have DI by definition. The patient's glucose concentration is normal, arguing against osmotic diuresis. Distinguishing between central and nephrogenic DI in a patient who already demonstrates hyperosmolality can be done by measuring antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels (patients with central DI have an inappropriately low level, whereas patients with nephrogenic DI have a normal to elevated level) or by evaluating the response to administering the vasopressor analogue desmopressin (arginine vasopressin). A significant increase in urine osmolality (>50%) within 1 to 2 hours after administration indicates central DI, whereas a lack of response indicates nephrogenic DI. Central DI can result from tumors that invade the hypothalamus, infiltrating diseases such as sarcoidosis, or surgical destruction. Nephrogenic DI can be caused by medications (for example, lithium), hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, sickle cell disease and trait, and amyloidosis. Central DI can be treated with intranasal or oral desmopressin."
