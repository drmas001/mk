"). This rare malignant cardiac tumor often presents with symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain. A cardiac angiosarcoma generally arises in the right heart, most commonly the right atrium, and this patient's findings of a right atrial mass involving the lateral atrial wall with tamponade and bloody pericardial fluid are typical. Metastasis to the lungs, liver, lymphatic system, bone, and adrenal glands is commonly present at the time of diagnosis. Pericardiocentesis with cytologic examination of the fluid is often negative for malignancy, and tissue biopsy is frequently required for diagnosis. Surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be considered, but survival rates are low even for patients in whom surgery is feasible."
