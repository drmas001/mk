"The classic symptoms are dyspnea on exertion, nonproductive cough, and hypoxemia; low-grade fevers are also common. A subset of patients develop radiation fibrosis 6 to 12 months after treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembroluzimab are immunomodulatory drugs that are widely used in the management of advanced malignancies, including non–small cell lung cancer. Although they have significant clinical benefits, these drugs are also associated with significant adverse effects, including pneumonitis. In contrast to radiation pneumonitis, immune checkpoint inhibitor–related pneumonitis usually does not cross lung fissures. Pulmonary toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitors may also manifest as radiation recall pneumonitis, a variant of radiation pneumonitis, which manifests in areas of previous radiation exposure. Radiation recall pneumonitis can occur with multiple other chemotherapeutic agents, even years after radiation therapy."
