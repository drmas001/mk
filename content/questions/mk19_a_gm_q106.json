") is the best explanation for why the stool-based test is not appropriate for this patient. External validity is the extent to which the study results can be applied to settings other than the study setting; it represents the generalizability of the study results. In this situation, the presence of hematochezia and a significant family history increase the expected prevalence of colon cancer above what would be expected in an average-risk patient. This limits the ability to apply this test, which has acceptable performance in average-risk patients, to patients with a higher pretest probability. Specifically, a negative test result in this high-risk patient cannot reliably exclude the presence of colon cancer as well as it could in an average-risk patient."
