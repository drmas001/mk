"). Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend initiating antiviral treatment as soon as possible for adults with documented or suspected influenza who are hospitalized and for outpatients with severe or progressive illness regardless of illness duration. Treatment should also be initiated as soon as possible for all other patients at high risk for influenza-related complications such as older adults and immunosuppressed persons, such as this patient. Treatment can also be considered for otherwise healthy outpatients if started within 48 hours, household contacts of severely immunosuppressed patients, and health care workers who care for patients at high risk of developing complications from influenza. Neuraminidase inhibitors have activity against influenza A and B. They can be given orally (oseltamivir), intranasally (zanamivir), or intravenously (peramivir). Baloxavir is a polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitor that can be given as single-dose therapy for uncomplicated influenza. It must be started within 48 hours of symptom onset and appears to be as effective as a 5-day course of oseltamivir."
