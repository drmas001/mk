"). The Wells criteria include leg symptoms and examination findings as well as patient history. Examination findings and symptoms include calf swelling of 3 cm or more, swollen unilateral superficial veins, unilateral pitting edema, swelling of the entire leg, and localized tenderness along the deep venous system. Patient history criteria include previously documented DVT; active cancer or treatment of cancer in the past 6 months; paralysis, paresis, immobilization, or bedridden status for 3 days or more; and surgery. One point is given for each criterion that is present. If an alternative explanation for leg symptoms is present, then two points are removed. For patients with a score of 0 or 1, a D-dimer measurement should be obtained; no additional testing is indicated for a negative D-dimer result. For a Wells criteria score greater than 1, pretest probability of a DVT is high and duplex ultrasonography should be performed without initial D-dimer evaluation. This patient's leg swelling with pitting edema and recent cancer therapy earn a Wells criteria score of 3, so duplex ultrasonography should be performed."
