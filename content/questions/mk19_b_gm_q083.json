"), which results in well-circumscribed patches of nonscarring hair loss without scale. Alopecia areata affects men and women equally and most commonly presents before the age of 30 years. It can progress to complete loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) and all of the body (alopecia universalis). Other than the hair loss, alopecia areata is usually asymptomatic. On examination, “exclamation point” hairs, which are small broken hairs at the edges of the hair loss that are thicker at the top and thinner near the scalp, can be observed; these are a pathognomonic indicator of alopecia areata. The pathogenesis of alopecia areata is not fully understood, but an autoimmune process is postulated. Alopecia areata can be associated with atopic dermatitis, asthma, thyroid disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients with mild disease will often have spontaneous hair regrowth. More extensive involvement at onset has a poorer prognosis. Treatment includes potent topical or intralesional glucocorticoids for limited disease."
