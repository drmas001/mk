"). Guidelines recommend that clinicians educate patients on the favorable prognosis of acute low back pain with or without sciatica, including the high probability of improvement in the first month. Clinicians should also educate patients about the expected course, advise them to remain active, and provide effective self-care options. Shared decision making should be used to select the most appropriate treatment based on patient preferences, availability, harms, and costs. Support for patient education as a significant therapeutic intervention comes from a systematic review and meta-analysis that reported moderate- to high-quality evidence that patient education in primary care can provide long-term reassurance for patients with acute or subacute low back pain. Moderate-quality evidence showed that patient education reduces low back pain–related primary care visits more than usual care."
