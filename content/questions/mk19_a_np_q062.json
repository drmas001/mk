"). Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) may ultimately require renal replacement therapy. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) placement is the safest and most enduring option for vascular access. AVFs have superior clinical outcomes compared with arteriovenous grafts. Protecting the veins of the nondominant arm is of paramount importance for the future success of a functioning AVF and involves limiting phlebotomy and intravenous catheters in that arm."

") are long catheters that are inserted peripherally and terminate in the central veins. PICCs are popular because of their ease of insertion and use. PICC lines can lead to significant trauma and venous stenosis in the veins that may be used for AVF creation. This could impair blood flow through the fistula, impair maturation, and even lead to primary nonfunctioning of the hemodialysis access. Data demonstrate that PICC lines in either arm, placed before or after initiation of hemodialysis, are independently associated with a 15% to 20% lower likelihood of transition to any working fistula or graft. The long-term use of PICC lines is also associated with an increased risk for death. The American Society of Nephrology recommends that PICC line catheters should be avoided in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m",

") helps limit subclavian stenosis, which can impair the proper functioning of an arteriovenous access used for dialysis. Although central lines inserted through the internal jugular vein are associated with central venous stenosis, a central line is a better alternative than a PICC or subclavian insertion of a central venous catheter; central lines are not inserted into a peripheral vein, which would be used for the creation of a hemodialysis site, and utilize a vessel not as prone to stenosis as the subclavian vein."
