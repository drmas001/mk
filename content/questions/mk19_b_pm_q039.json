"). The patient presents with severe community-acquired pneumonia and an associated pleural effusion (parapneumonic effusion). A parapneumonic effusion can be either uncomplicated (sterile and free flowing) or complicated (infected or loculated). An uncomplicated effusion is typically small and can resolve on its own. A complicated parapneumonic effusion occurs when there has been bacterial invasion across the pleural mesothelium, stimulating a significant inflammatory response. A diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed to assess the pleural effusion. A parapneumonic effusion is considered complicated when an exudative effusion has either or both of the following characteristics: pH less than 7.2 (or glucose <40 mg/dL [2.2 mmol/L] in the absence of pH data) or evidence of microorganism invasion by culture or Gram stain. In the setting of suspected infection, a pleural fluid pH level of less than 7.2 is the best indicator of a complicated pleural effusion that requires drainage. Ultrasonography also has been found useful in the determination of a complicated parapneumonic effusion and has a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 90% when complexity is seen."
