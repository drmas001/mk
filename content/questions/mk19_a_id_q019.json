She was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for cystitis 2 weeks ago. Medical history is also significant for nephrolithiasis. Her only other medication is an oral contraceptive pill. She reports experiencing a rash with amoxicillin in childhood, but no adverse reactions to cephalosporin medications."

") or another broad-spectrum cephalosporin or carbapenem would be appropriate initial treatment options in this patient who has complicated acute pyelonephritis. Urinary tract infections in men, pregnant women, and persons with foreign bodies (e.g., indwelling catheters, calculi), kidney disease, immunocompromise, obstruction, urinary retention from neurologic disorders, health care–associated infections, or recent antibiotic use are considered to be complicated. This patient requires hospitalization because of potential hemodynamic instability, inability to tolerate oral medication, and concern for pathogen resistance because of recent antimicrobial therapies. Urine and blood cultures should be performed as well. A detailed antibiotic allergy history regarding possible reactions to penicillin is required to determine the patient has no clear contraindication to these β-lactam medications and serves to avoid the use of other potentially less effective and more costly antimicrobial therapies."
