"). Active surveillance is a management option that consists of planned monitoring and deferred therapy for patients with low-grade prostate cancer. Monitoring during active surveillance consists of a repeat biopsy done approximately 1 year from the original diagnosis and, assuming no high-grade tumor has developed, less often thereafter; annual digital rectal examination should be done yearly, and serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements should be done every 6 to 12 months. Sustained rise in PSA or new abnormalities on digital rectal examination warrant an additional prostate biopsy, perhaps guided by MRI imaging. The goal of active surveillance is to more promptly identify men with evidence of cancer progression that requires treatment while also avoiding treatment in men who do not have progressive cancer. In men with low-risk prostate cancer, active surveillance is a reasonable strategy because some men will never require treatment, and outcomes are no worse if men with low-grade cancer are treated at the time of progression rather than when first diagnosed. This patient has experienced a doubling of PSA in just 1 year. Although PSA alone cannot definitely identify men who require treatment, a doubling time of less than 3 years is grounds for reassessment with a repeat biopsy."
