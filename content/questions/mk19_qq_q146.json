The decision to order a specific stress test is based on the pretest probability of CAD, the patient's ability to exercise, findings on the resting ECG, and the presence of comorbid conditions. This patient's age, sex, and atypical chest pain place her pretest probability of CAD at 51%; therefore, it would be most appropriate to start with noninvasive testing to establish a diagnosis. An exercise myocardial perfusion test is the best option because she is able to exercise and has abnormalities on her resting ECG."

If there are baseline ECG abnormalities (such as ST-segment depression >1 mm, left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, or preexcitation), ST-segment changes with exercise cannot be used to evaluate for the presence of obstructive CAD; these abnormalities will result in a nondiagnostic ECG stress test. Functional testing with imaging (with exercise or pharmacologic stress) or anatomic assessment with coronary CT angiography is indicated in these instances."
