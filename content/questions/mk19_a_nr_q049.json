"A 70-year-old woman is evaluated in the hospital for the recent onset of severe back pain and gait ataxia. Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer was diagnosed 1 month ago. Metastases to brain, liver, and adrenal glands were noted. She has decided to forego active therapy and has opted for comfort care. Until the past week she has experienced only modest pain. Her other medical problems include chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and oxygen-dependent COPD. Medications are oral morphine, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, albuterol, and tiotropium inhalers. Her predicted life expectancy is 3 months."

"). Neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) develops in approximately 2.5% of patients with metastatic cancer. Lung, breast, and prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma are the most common types of cancer that cause ESCC in adults. Emergent use of high-dose glucocorticoids is the first step. Systematic reviews of the evidence suggest that surgical decompression followed by radiotherapy is most beneficial for patients younger than 65 years who have a single area of compression, paraplegia with a duration of less than 48 hours, and a predicted survival of greater than 6 months. In patients not meeting these criteria, such as this patient, surgical intervention may be of little benefit, and radiotherapy alone may be used. Furthermore, certain radiosensitive tumor types, such as leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and germ cell tumors, may not require initial surgical decompression and instead may be treated urgently with radiation therapy."

"). Neurologic function is rarely regained as a result of therapy, but further deterioration may be prevented. In properly selected patients, clinical trials have shown the superiority of surgical decompression in optimizing ambulation. However, it is unlikely that this patient with a limited life span will benefit from surgical intervention regardless of whether it is combined with glucocorticoids and/or radiation therapy."
