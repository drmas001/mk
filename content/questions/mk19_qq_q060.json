"). The diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) is based on increased levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Physical examination focuses on volume status, signs of systemic illness that might impair kidney function, and evidence of urinary obstruction (such as a palpable bladder or flank pain). Laboratory evaluation includes BUN and creatinine concentrations, electrolytes, complete blood count, and assessment of the urine (urine indices, urinalysis, and microscopic evaluation of the urine sediment). In patients with AKI, pigmented (muddy brown) granular casts and tubular epithelial cells will establish the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and help distinguish it from prerenal azotemia (normal urinalysis or hyaline casts), antibiotic-associated interstitial nephritis (mild proteinuria, leukocytes, erythrocytes, leukocyte casts, eosinophiluria), acute glomerulonephritis (proteinuria, dysmorphic erythrocytes, erythrocyte casts), and intratubular obstruction (crystalluria or Bence-Jones proteinuria)."

"Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) associated with new organ dysfunction. ACS occurs in the setting of abdominal surgery, trauma, hemoperitoneum, retroperitoneal bleed, ascites, bowel obstruction, ileus, and pancreatitis. It can also occur from capillary leak with concurrent massive fluid resuscitation. Increasing IAP causes hypoperfusion and ischemia of the intestines and other peritoneal and retroperitoneal structures, leading to hemodynamic, respiratory, neurologic, and kidney impairment. Renal vein compression and renal artery vasoconstriction cause oliguric AKI. ACS is diagnosed by measuring IAP; measurement of bladder pressure (",
