"A 26-year-old man is evaluated for spells that began 4 months ago and occur twice monthly. He has no memory of the episodes, but family members report that he suddenly stops talking and sometimes has twitching of the right arm. He will not look at them, will not speak, and does not follow verbal commands. Family members also report stiffness and clenching of his right hand toward the end of an episode, which typically lasts 30 to 90 seconds. After he regains speech and the twitching stops, he usually has slurred speech, right-arm weakness, and mild confusion for up to 30 minutes. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications."

"). These seizures are characterized by the sudden onset of staring or arrested speech (seizure-related aphasia) or behavior, lasting at least 30 but up to 90 seconds during which the patient is unaware and unresponsive. Episodes are followed by a short period of postictal somnolence or confusion. When focal seizures (with or without impaired awareness) involve the frontal lobe, specifically the motor cortex, contralateral limb twitching and stiffness can be seen during the seizure, with transient weakness immediately after the seizure (Todd paralysis). Postictal aphasia can occur with a seizure emanating from the dominant hemisphere. Episodes usually occur weekly or monthly."

Myoclonic seizures may result in dropping objects and also can result in falls. Awareness is maintained during the seizures."
