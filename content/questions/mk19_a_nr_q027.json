"). Patients with acute stroke, including patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), are at increased risk for VTE. In patients with acute stroke, guidelines recommend intermittent pneumatic compression beginning the day of hospital admission. Intermittent pneumatic compression is superior to either knee-high or thigh-high compression stockings in the prevention of VTE. After 24 hours, if there is no evidence of hematoma expansion, then subcutaneous pharmacoprophylaxis (typically, low-molecular-weight heparin) is recommended for VTE prophylaxis."
