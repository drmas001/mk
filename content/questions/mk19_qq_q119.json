") is the most appropriate management for this patient with a mild upper respiratory tract infection, or the common cold. The majority of cases of the common cold have a viral etiology. This syndrome is a benign, self-limited condition that typically presents with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise; different symptoms may be predominant in individual patients. Most patients require no treatment other than reassurance. Some patients with more severe symptoms may require symptomatic relief, but evidence of effectiveness for the recommended remedies varies. Nasal symptoms may respond to intranasal cromolyn, intranasal ipratropium, or combination decongestant/antihistamines. Other potential symptomatic treatments to consider are intranasal saline spray, NSAIDs, and acetaminophen."

"). Antibiotics given for viral illnesses do not improve symptoms, illness duration, or patient satisfaction with medical care. Purulent rhinorrhea or sputum does not reliably predict bacterial infection or superinfection. Therefore, purulence should not be used as a criterion for antibiotic administration. Evidence-based guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America suggest antibiotics if bacterial rhinosinusitis is highly suspected on the basis of persistent symptoms or signs lasting more than 10 days without evidence of clinical improvement, onset with severe symptoms (fever >39.0 째C [102.2 째F]), or onset with worsening symptoms or signs (new fever, headache, or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that were initially improving)."
