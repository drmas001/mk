"), otherwise known as verrucae plantaris. Plantar warts usually present as exophytic papules on the soles of the feet. Hyperkeratotic debris often covers the tops of the lesions. After scraping the lesion surface, black or red dots (thrombosed capillaries) become visible. Plantar and palmar warts also cover skin lines and thus obscure dermatoglyphics (skin markings or ridge patterns of the skin). Plantar warts are usually caused by human papillomavirus type 1. Warts are usually self-limited; however, in severe cases, destructive treatments such as cryosurgery or topical application of salicylic acid, tricarboxylic acid, cantharidin, or podophyllin can be used."

") results from intraepidermal extravasation of red blood cells in the epidermis of the heel. The appearance can mimic the thrombosed capillaries of plantar warts. Black heel often occurs in athletes, such as runners, because of intradermal hemorrhages caused by sheer friction against the shoe. The lesions of black heel resolve spontaneously with discontinuation of the causative activity. Black heel lesions do not obscure dermatoglyphics and can be removed by scraping, thus differentiating them from plantar warts."

") is a bacterial infection of the soles of the feet or (less commonly) the palms of the hand, with characteristic appearance and odor. As the name suggests, the infection manifests as scale and pitting of the skin surface. These pits may coalesce into larger erosions. In the United States, the infection is most common among patients with hyperhidrosis and prolonged occlusion of the feet (athletes, military personnel, laborers). Other than appearance and odor, symptoms are usually minimal and limited to mild pruritus or slight discomfort. Treatment is with topical antibacterial therapy, such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide preparations."
