") is indicated in this patient with a 1.5-cm ASD associated with right heart enlargement, symptoms, and no pulmonary hypertension. An ASD is a defect in the atrial septum resulting in a left-to-right shunt with eventual right-sided cardiac chamber dilatation in most patients. Ostium secundum defects, the most common type of ASD (75% of cases), are typically located in the mid portion of the atrial septum and are usually isolated anomalies. In asymptomatic patients with a small ASD and no right heart enlargement, periodic clinical monitoring and echocardiographic imaging are recommended. The main indications for ASD closure include right-sided cardiac chamber enlargement, dyspnea, or paradoxical embolization. Most patients with ostium secundum ASD are candidates for device closure of the ASD, a procedure performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory."
