"). Chronic sinusitis manifests with at least 12 weeks of nasal congestion with purulent drainage, diminished sense of smell, or facial pain/pressure. It may be associated with nasal polyposis (with a strong association with asthma). Demonstration of mucosal involvement by nasal endoscopy or imaging (typically CT) is necessary for diagnosis. The findings most commonly seen on CT scan include mucosal thickening, sinus ostial obstruction, polyps, and sinus opacification. Treatment includes glucocorticoids and antibiotics. CT without contrast is the most commonly used imaging modality for the diagnosis of chronic sinusitis."
