"). The development of ascites is often the first manifestation of decompensation of cirrhosis. Ascites results from portal hypertension and functional renal impairment, which leads to ineffective natriuresis and retention of sodium. In patients with ascites due to cirrhosis, the initial management of ascites consists of dietary sodium restriction, which may equalize the sodium balance in patients and prevent ascites. If this treatment does not resolve the sodium imbalance, a diuretic regimen with spironolactone and furosemide can be prescribed to increase natriuresis. Medications that decrease renal perfusion pressures, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, can worsen ascites in patients with portal hypertension. Prostaglandin inhibitors, such as NSAIDs, can reduce urinary sodium excretion in patients with cirrhosis and can induce azotemia. Consequently, the 2021 guideline from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that NSAIDs; ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril; and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Based on available data, nonselective β-blockers are not necessarily contraindicated in patients with refractory ascites. However, caution is recommended in patients with hypotension, hyponatremia, or acute kidney injury."

However, the overall benefits of these medications typically outweigh the potential harms, especially in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as in this patient with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Therefore, discontinuation of atorvastatin is not appropriate."
