Benign nodules are more likely to be solid in appearance with well-defined, smooth borders. Nodules smaller than 6 mm in a patient at low risk for lung cancer do not require follow-up evaluation; in patients at higher risk, repeat CT may be considered (optional) in 12 months. The patient has a solitary pulmonary nodule of 5 mm in diameter and is at low risk for lung cancer. Therefore, no follow-up is appropriate."
