"A 58-year-old woman is evaluated in follow-up after her third hospitalization for severe dyspnea in the past 6 months. She has pulmonary arterial hypertension and stage G4 chronic kidney disease. During the visit, she describes a progressive decline in her functional status. Her resuscitation status is listed as “full code” in her discharge summary, but she has noted in previous meetings that she does not want to be a “vegetable” if she has an incurable disease. Medications are bumetanide, aspirin, apixaban, and treprostinil. She is on supplemental oxygen at home."

Identifying what patients understand about their prognosis is critical to determining next steps for information sharing and prognostic disclosures."
