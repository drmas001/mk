In patients in whom low back pain cannot be attributed to a specific disease or spinal abnormality (defined as nonspecific low back pain), routine imaging or other diagnostic testing is not recommended. Such testing should be reserved for patients in whom a serious underlying condition is suspected, those with severe or progressive neurologic deficits, or patients without symptom improvement after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative management. As this patient's pain meets the definition of nonspecific low back pain, no additional imaging or testing is indicated before initiating therapy."
