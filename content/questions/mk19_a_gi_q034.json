"). The patient reports a 4-month history of diarrhea characterized by watery, nonbloody bowel movements. This duration of symptoms (>4 weeks) is classified as chronic diarrhea. In contrast to acute diarrhea, which is usually caused by infectious agents, chronic diarrhea is more commonly noninfectious. Patients with diarrhea should be asked about new medications and the timing of the initiation of medication in relation to diarrhea onset. Metformin is a common cause of chronic watery diarrhea, possibly related to a promotility effect and stimulation of intestinal chloride secretion. The temporal association with the commencement of metformin (which was started 4 months ago, coinciding with symptom onset) strongly suggests that metformin is the cause of diarrhea."
