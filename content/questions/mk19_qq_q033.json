") for her alcohol dependence. Brief nonpharmacologic interventions are effective for patients with at-risk alcohol use, but more aggressive therapy, potentially including pharmacotherapy, is indicated in both alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence. Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, has been shown to be effective in short-term treatment and in decreasing the frequency of relapse. Disulfiram is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor that causes an accumulation of aldehyde if alcohol is consumed, which results in vomiting, headache, and anxiety. Studies have been inconclusive on its efficacy in enhancing abstinence. It is considered second-line treatment for alcohol dependence and should be used only in patients who have contraindications to or intolerance of first-line treatments (naltrexone or acamprosate) and who have been fully counseled on the potential for symptoms if relapse occurs."
