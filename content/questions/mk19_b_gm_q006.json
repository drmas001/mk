"). Adults aged 50 years or older should receive the recombinant (inactivated) herpes zoster vaccine to reduce the incidence of zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. The recombinant vaccine is administered intramuscularly in two doses, with an interval of 2 to 6 months between doses. This patient's previous episode of herpes zoster does not provide immunity against future episodes and should not preclude additional zoster vaccination. In addition, persons who received the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine, such as this patient, should be offered the recombinant herpes zoster vaccine given its increased efficacy; the recombinant vaccine has shown 97% efficacy in persons aged 50 to 69 years and 91% efficacy in persons aged 70 years or older. Patients who have received the live attenuated vaccine should wait at least 8 weeks before receiving the recombinant vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also recommends administering the recombinant vaccine in patients at increased risk for zoster because of immunocompromise resulting from disease or therapy."
