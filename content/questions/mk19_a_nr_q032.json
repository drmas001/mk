"). The patient is seen because of an acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours of onset and was appropriately treated with intravenous alteplase. Patients eligible for alteplase should receive alteplase even if mechanical thrombectomy is being considered. She has had a large stroke, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 18, and has examination findings consistent with a large-vessel (middle cerebral or intracranial carotid artery) occlusion, including aphasia. A large-vessel occlusion is associated with lower rates of neurologic improvement and recanalization with alteplase; treatment with thrombectomy after thrombolysis is indicated and associated with improved neurologic outcomes. In patients with a large-vessel occlusion, thrombectomy should be considered within 6 hours after symptom onset if noncontrast CT of the head shows no extensive infarction. Thrombectomy can be considered in select patients not treated with thrombolysis in a 6- to 24-hour time-of-onset window. A large-vessel occlusion can be identified only with vascular imaging; CT angiography is indicated in patients with a suspicion of a large-vessel occlusion on the basis of examination."
