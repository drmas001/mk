"). This patient has olecranon bursitis, manifesting as an accumulation of fluid in the olecranon bursa. Common causes include trauma, intensive physical labor, infection (septic bursitis), crystal deposition (uric acid, calcium phosphate), and inflammation from rheumatologic disorders. In this patient without symptoms of infection (no erythema, warmth, or significant pain) or rheumatologic disease, bursitis was probably induced by repetitive stress due to gardening. Supportive care with joint rest, ice, elbow protection, and as-needed NSAID therapy provides the best clinical outcome for aseptic, mechanical olecranon bursitis."

In these cases, contiguous skin infection is commonly present. This patient has no evidence of concomitant skin infection or local signs of inflammation, and bursa aspiration is not indicated."
