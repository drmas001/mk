") is appropriate for this patient. Acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease (pseudogout) typically presents as a monoarticular inflammatory arthritis, characterized by sudden onset of swelling, pain, loss of function, tenderness, and warmth of the affected joint, usually a knee or wrist. Similar to acute gout, flares may be provoked by systemic insults such as major surgery or acute illness. Flares are usually milder than those of gout but can persist for months if untreated. This patient has intracellular positively birefringent (blue when parallel to and yellow when perpendicular to the polarizing axis of an optical filter) rhomboid-shaped calcium pyrophosphate crystals, consistent with a diagnosis of pseudogout. If present on radiographs, linear calcium deposits in the cartilage (chondrocalcinosis) would also support the diagnosis of pseudogout. Treatment is directed exclusively toward relieving the inflammation with agents such as NSAIDs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids and is tailored to the individual patient. Initial therapy with an intra-articular glucocorticoid (after aspiration confirms no infection is present) is usually recommended as first-line therapy if the joint is amenable to injection."
