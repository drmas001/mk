"). Dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, botanicals, herbals, metabolites, and amino acids, are categorized as foods by the FDA. Therefore, manufacturers are not required to demonstrate efficacy or safety of their products unless the supplement includes ingredients that were introduced after 1994. As a result, the efficacy of most supplements has not been subject to rigorous evaluation. In addition to questionable efficacy, supplement use is associated with risk for both direct and indirect harms. Direct harms include side effects; interactions with other drugs; and harms related to inclusion of unadvertised additives, compounds, or toxins. Indirect harms occur when dietary supplement use replaces or delays standard treatments that have demonstrated efficacy. When counseling patients using supplements, the physician's role is to inform these patients of potential side effects and benefits, if known."
