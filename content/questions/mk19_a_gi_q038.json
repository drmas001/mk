"). In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, ascites is a manifestation of inadequate natriuresis, with increased splanchnic blood flow and reduced renal perfusion. These factors contribute to accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal space. Initial management of ascites includes dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy with spironolactone and furosemide. As the splanchnic vasculature progressively dilates and renal perfusion decreases with worsening of portal hypertension, hepatorenal syndrome can develop, which manifests as declining renal function. The initial evaluation of these patients is investigation for a decrease in intravascular volume and for infection and exclusion of other causes of acute kidney injury. In this patient, furosemide and spironolactone may be exacerbating renal hypoperfusion and should be stopped. Assessment for oliguria, urinalysis (bland urinary sediment), and urine sodium concentration (low) is also appropriate in the evaluation for suspected hepatorenal syndrome."
