"). Categories of the extent of ulcerative colitis include proctitis (within 18 cm of the anal verge, distal to the rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis (extending from the sigmoid to the splenic flexure), and extensive colitis (beyond the splenic flexure). This patient's symptoms, colonoscopy findings, and histopathologic features are diagnostic of mild, left-sided ulcerative colitis. The initial therapy of choice would be 5-ASA enemas because they deliver active drug to the rectum and sigmoid colon. 5-ASAs are anti-inflammatory medications and the mainstay of treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, with a dose-dependent response when used to induce disease remission. Of note, combined 5-ASA therapy (oral and topical) is superior for induction of remission compared with oral or topical therapies alone. Once remission is achieved, 5-ASAs are effective in maintaining it."

") would be effective in inducing remission of left-sided ulcerative colitis. However, topical 5-ASA therapy is superior to topical glucocorticoids for this indication for several reasons. 5-ASAs are effective in maintenance of remission, whereas topical glucocorticoids are effective only for induction. In addition, glucocorticoids have significant adverse effects. However, guidelines recommend glucocorticoid enemas in patients with mild to moderate proctitis or left-sided colitis who are intolerant of or refractory to oral or topical 5-ASA therapy."
