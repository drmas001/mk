"). Persons with HIV infection who have at least 6 months of sustained viral suppression have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to HIV-negative partners. A large multicenter, observational study of HIV serodiscordant couples (including same-sex and heterosexual couples) showed no transmissions of HIV during condomless sex from effectively treated HIV-positive to HIV-negative partners. Several other studies have similarly shown that HIV-positive persons with sustained viral suppression do not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. This is described as “Undetectable = Untransmittable” (U = U), which was endorsed by the CDC in 2017. The most important factor is that the HIV-positive partner is consistently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieves viral suppression, maintaining an undetectable viral load for at least 6 months. U = U has been particularly endorsed to minimize stigma around HIV, and it is encouraged that physicians involved in the care of persons with HIV share this important update with their patients."

"This patient's risk for transmitting HIV to his partner is effectively zero. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool for HIV prevention and is often recommended for HIV-negative partners in serodiscordant relationships to prevent HIV acquisition from the HIV-positive partner. However, PrEP is most beneficial when the HIV-positive partner is not taking ART or does not have sustained viral suppression. Recommending daily or on-demand PrEP (“2-1-1” strategy of two pills on the day of planned sexual exposure and one pill on the subsequent 2 days) for the partner is also unlikely to provide benefit considering the patient's sustained virologic suppression (",
