"). This patient presents with signs of depression, including low energy, lack of interest in activities, and poor sleep. Major depression is very common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and likely occurs in approximately 50% of patients during their lifetime. Approximately 10% of patients with MS have experienced persistent thoughts of suicide. Furthermore, the suicide rate for patients with MS and depression is elevated compared with that of patients with depression only. MS-related depression is likely multifactorial, involving the emotional response to dealing with a chronic disease, the consequence of demyelinating lesions and inflammatory cytokines on neurotransmitter function, and the adverse effects of treatments (such as interferon beta). Clinicians should be vigilant for the signs of depression, and if present, screen for suicidality. If suicidal ideation is present, the lethality of the ideation should be evaluated. Clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating antidepressants and offering referrals to psychiatry or psychology for counseling. Referral to a psychiatrist is indicated for patients with severe depression, failure of initial therapy, complex psychiatric comorbidities, and high suicide risk."
