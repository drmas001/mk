"). The term “ketosis-prone diabetes” incorporates several glycemic syndromes and is also known as ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes mellitus, “Flatbush diabetes,” idiopathic type 1 diabetes, type 1B diabetes, and atypical diabetes. These syndromes present with episodic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resulting from insulin deficiency but have variable periods of insulin dependence and independence. For individuals with ketosis-prone diabetes, insulin therapy for DKA is required until DKA has resolved and the β cells are no longer impaired by glucose toxicity and can produce sufficient amounts of insulin to suppress lipolysis. Assessment of β-cell reserve with a fasting C-peptide level should be performed weeks to months after the episode of DKA; β-cell function is indicated by a C-peptide concentration of at least 1 ng/mL (0.33 nmol/L). Patients should also be evaluated for type 1 diabetes with fasting C-peptide measurement or a glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies test. This patient has the clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetes (insulin production, obesity, strong family history), intact β-cell function, negative antibodies, and is on relatively low doses of insulin for her body weight. The insulin may be discontinued, and she can start metformin."
