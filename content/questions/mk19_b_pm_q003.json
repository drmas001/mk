"). The patient has a spontaneous pneumothorax. Because he has no known underlying lung disease, this would be classified as a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). A secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) occurs in someone with known underlying lung disease, such as COPD. The risk of recurrence after an initial occurrence of a PSP is 17% to 54% in the first year. Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for PSP. The relative risk of a first event of PSP is 22-fold higher in men and 9 times higher in women who smoke tobacco than in those who do not smoke. The patient should be counseled to stop smoking and offered pharmacologic assistance. Other risk factors include tall height and a low body mass index. Treatment for a first episode of PSP is observation, oxygen and observation, needle aspiration, or placement of a small-bore thoracostomy, depending on symptomatology. Definitive treatment with pleurodesis to prevent recurrence is usually not provided until a second ipsilateral event has occurred, unless the patient's occupation is considered high risk. This patient is a professional scuba diver and is at high risk of death if he has a recurrence while diving. Flying at high altitude is also considered a high-risk occupation. Given the patient's occupation, a more definitive management plan should be pursued following insertion of tube thoracostomy with either mechanical or talc pleurodesis."
