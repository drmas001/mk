Medications are metformin, empagliflozin, chlorthalidone, and atorvastatin. She consumes a heart-healthy diet, exercises 150 minutes weekly, and does not smoke. She drinks one glass of red wine nightly. She recently began taking vitamins A, C, E, and D with calcium for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease."

Overall, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with multivitamins to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with individual vitamins or minerals or functional pairs in healthy populations without known nutritional deficiencies to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Although these interventions lack proof of efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, they appear to be without harm if taken in recommended doses."
