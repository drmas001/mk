"The most likely diagnosis is an autonomously functioning thyroid adenoma. The initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule begins with measuring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Patients with thyroid nodules and a suppressed TSH are further evaluated with thyroid scintigraphy. A radioactive isotope is administered; the percentage taken up by the thyroid is calculated (radioactive iodine uptake); and an image is obtained (thyroid scan). Hot nodules concentrate radioactive iodine to a greater extent than normal thyroid tissue, as seen in this patient's thyroid scintigraphy, which shows increased uptake in the lower left thyroid lobe. Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (toxic nodules) are mostly benign and there is no need for biopsy."
