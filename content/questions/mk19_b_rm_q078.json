"). This patient has classic ankylosing spondylitis (AS), as suggested by inflammatory low back pain with signs of sacroiliac joint irritation, limitation of lumbar spine motion, and changes of sacroiliitis on radiograph. NSAIDs are recommended first-line therapy for AS. In general, an NSAID must be dosed toward the higher end of the dosing range to modify new bone formation and have a significant impact on inflammation. If an NSAID is started early in the course of AS (<3 years), 35% of patients will enter remission compared with only 12% to 15% of those starting it later. Unlike with other rheumatologic diseases, evidence suggests that NSAID use in AS has a disease-modifying effect. Patients should be aware of and monitored for NSAID toxicity, such as hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and kidney disease. Physical therapy is the most important nonpharmacologic intervention in AS. The goals of therapy include improving pain and stiffness, maintaining range of motion, and reducing disability; transition to an ongoing daily exercise program is optimal."

"), is recommended as second-line disease-modifying therapy. The efficacy of TNF inhibitors in patients with active AS has been demonstrated in numerous randomized controlled trials, which showed improvements in clinical, radiographic, and MRI outcomes. Patients in whom a TNF inhibitor fails should receive an interleukin-17 inhibitor, such as secukinumab or ixekizumab."
