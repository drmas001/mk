Renal duplex Doppler ultrasound at that time showed a 7-cm right kidney and 11-cm left kidney with a >75% midstenotic lesion of the left renal artery. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral artery disease. Medications are low-dose aspirin, furosemide, lisinopril, amlodipine, carvedilol, metformin, empagliflozin, and atorvastatin."

") is needed for this patient with stable renovascular hypertension. Clinical suspicion for renovascular hypertension is raised when patients >55 years of age present with onset of severe hypertension and develop acute kidney injury (AKI) after initiation of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or after control of blood pressure (BP) to target goal. In addition, asymmetry >1.5 cm in kidney sizes on imaging or the presence of a kidney ≤9 cm can also increase the probability. Patients such as this one with evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should receive medical therapy, including lifestyle interventions, low-dose aspirin, BP control, guideline-directed diabetes management, and high-intensity statin therapy. In patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G3 or higher or stage G1 or G2 with albuminuria, treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended to slow kidney disease progression."

This patient has none of these indications. Finally, patients with advanced CKD or with proteinuria >1000 mg/g, such as this patient, are less likely to benefit from revascularization."

") have higher diagnostic utility than ultrasonography, these imaging studies may be potentially harmful in patients with severe CKD, given the risk for contrast nephropathy and gadolinium-induced nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (with group 1 but not group 2 gadolinium-based contras media). Renal duplex Doppler ultrasonography is a reasonable imaging modality in these patients if performed by experienced sonographers. Additional testing for renal vascular disease is not required in this patient and is not cost-effective, given that no interventions other than continuing the current medical management will be undertaken."
