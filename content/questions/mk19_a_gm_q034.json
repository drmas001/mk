") in this patient with orthostatic syncope. The most common causes of orthostatic syncope are autonomic failure, hypovolemia, medications, and aging. The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) syncope guideline recommends assessment for orthostatic hypotension in all patients with syncope. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or greater or a drop in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater upon assuming an upright posture. Immediate orthostatic hypotension is a transient blood pressure decrease within 15 seconds after standing. Classic orthostatic hypotension, as manifested by this patient, is characterized by a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater within 3 minutes of standing. Delayed orthostatic hypotension occurs after 3 minutes of standing with a more gradual drop in blood pressure until the threshold for orthostatic hypotension is reached. The risk for medication-related syncope increases with age. Several drug classes are implicated, including diuretics, vasodilators, venodilators, negative chronotropes, and sedatives. The AHA/ACC/HRS syncope guideline recommends reducing or withdrawing medications that may cause hypotension. Careful monitoring following medication adjustment is important because supine hypertension may result from antihypertensive medication reduction or withdrawal."

"Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a subtype of orthostatic hypotension caused by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (central or peripheral). Parkinson disease and Lewy body dementia are common causes of central neurogenic orthostatic syncope, whereas peripheral autonomic neuropathies due to diabetes mellitus and amyloidosis are the more common causes of peripheral neurogenic orthostatic syncope.
