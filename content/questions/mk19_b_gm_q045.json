"). When presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding, premenopausal women aged 45 years or older or those younger than 45 years who are at increased risk for endometrial cancer should undergo endometrial biopsy. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity (BMI ≥30); a history of unopposed estrogen (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity); or genetic syndromes, such as Lynch or Cowden syndrome. Failure of medical management for abnormal uterine bleeding is another indication for endometrial biopsy. Because this patient is 39 years old and obese, she is at increased risk for endometrial cancer and should undergo endometrial biopsy to evaluate for hyperplasia or malignancy. In postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding, transvaginal ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the thickness of the endometrial lining; an endometrial thickness greater than 4 mm may indicate hyperplasia or malignancy and biopsy is indicated. However, in premenopausal women, endometrial thickness is not a reliable indicator because it varies with the menstrual cycle. Although transvaginal ultrasonography may be appropriate to evaluate for structural causes of abnormal bleeding, it does not substitute for an endometrial biopsy and biopsy is usually performed regardless of the ultrasound findings."
