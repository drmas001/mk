"). In the case of a patient who lacks decision-making capacity, a surrogate must guide the decision making. If the patient has an advance directive, the person named in that document is the most appropriate (and legal) surrogate. In the absence of this, many states stipulate a hierarchy of surrogate decision makers (for example, the patient's spouse, followed by an adult child, and so forth). Clinicians should be aware of legal requirements for surrogate appointment in their state. In this patient's case, her adult daughter is the most appropriate surrogate. Surrogates have ethical and legal obligations to make decisions based on the patient's known wishes. If these are not known, surrogates should make decisions based on the patient's health care-related values, goals, and preferences (substituted judgment), if known."
