") in the evaluation of unexplained gross hematuria. Hematuria is defined as the presence of â‰¥3 erythrocytes/hpf in the urine sediment and may be microscopic (detectable only on urine testing) or macroscopic (grossly visible). A single incidental finding of hematuria is sufficient to warrant further investigation. Evaluation should be pursued even in patients with bleeding diatheses, or in those taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. If menstruation, viral illness, vigorous exercise, or some other benign cause is suspected, urinalysis should be repeated after the cause is resolved. If infection is confirmed, urinalysis should be repeated after treatment to document resolution of hematuria. Although CT urography (contrast CT with kidney-specific imaging) has the highest sensitivity and specificity for renal malignancy, noncontrast helical CT is more appropriate if a kidney stone is suspected. Ultrasonography is a reasonable first imaging step because of availability, lower cost, and no ionizing radiation. Cystoscopy is indicated when imaging results are negative."
