"A 62-year-old woman is evaluated for a change in her abdominal and pelvic pain symptoms. The patient has been followed for 3 years for medically unexplained symptoms. Her typical symptoms have included chronic pelvic pain of unknown cause and migrating upper abdominal pain. An extensive evaluation, including endoscopy, advanced imaging, and laboratory evaluation, has been negative. Her symptoms have been stable for the past 2 years until recently. Her new abdominal symptom is central boring pain that has been present for 6 weeks and is associated with anorexia, diarrhea, and a 2-kg (4.4-lb) weight loss. She is currently taking no medications."

"). This patient's chronic gastrointestinal symptoms have changed significantly. Further evaluation with imaging is warranted. In patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS), each presenting symptom merits a relevant history and physical examination. In most cases, previous records should be reviewed before the evaluation is repeated or extended unless the patient's condition has significantly changed. If new symptoms arise or symptoms change, clinicians should respond empathically and perform an appropriately thorough investigation. This patient has new symptoms after a period of relative stability. The new symptoms are associated with a significant “red flag” of weight loss and should not be dismissed. Advanced imaging is a reasonable starting point in the evaluation of this patient."

However, onset of new abdominal pain after a period of stability associated with abdominal tenderness to palpation and weight loss signals the possibility of a condition other than depression, and additional investigation is required."
