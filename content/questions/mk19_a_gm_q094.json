"). Statins can cause asymptomatic, dose-related elevations in aminotransferase levels in approximately 1% of patients. Rarely, the initiation of statin therapy can be associated with severe liver injury (<0.001% of patients). When this occurs, it is often 3 to 4 months after initiation of therapy. Studies comparing statins with placebo have shown no difference in the incidence of persistently elevated aminotransferase levels, despite this finding being commonly attributed to the initiation of statin therapy. If the ALT level becomes elevated more than three times the upper limit of normal when measured for clinically relevant indications, the statin dose should be reduced or the drug should be discontinued. It is not necessary to repeat aminotransferase measurements during statin therapy in the absence of symptoms."
