Because of the altered immune state associated with MM, pneumococcal vaccination with the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine alone or 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) should be provided in accordance with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines. Although the interval between PCV15 and subsequent PPSV23 is usually at least 1 year, a minimum of 8 weeks can be considered in patients with an immunocompromising condition such as MM. Ideally, immunization with inactivated vaccines should be provided at least 2 weeks before initiation of chemotherapy. In addition, annual influenza vaccination with standard-dose killed vaccine should be administered to all patients with MM and to household members. Response to vaccinations may be suboptimal, but vaccination still provides benefit and is recommended for all patients with MM."
