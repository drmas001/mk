Clicking in the glenohumeral joint is noted with passive rotation of the arm in an abducted position. Tests for rotator cuff injury are negative. Strength is 5/5 throughout the left arm."

"), specifically a tear of the superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP). A SLAP tear is an injury to the glenoid labrum, the fibrocartilaginous rim around the margin of the glenoid cavity, leading to biceps tendon instability and a feeling of instability of the joint. SLAP tears are most common in patients older than 40 years who engage in repetitive overhead activities, such as weightlifting or throwing. Pain is often deep and difficult to localize and worsens with repetition of the overhead movement. Patients report crepitus, catching of the joint with movement, and overall joint instability."

") can result from repetitive lifting and carrying. Biceps tendinopathy typically presents with pain localized to the anterior shoulder, radiating toward the deltoid. As with a SLAP lesion, pain is elicited with overhead activities that put stress on the shoulder. On physical examination, pain is reproduced by palpating the long head of the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove or by placing the patient's ipsilateral arm at his or her side while flexing the elbow to 90 degrees and supinating against resistance."
