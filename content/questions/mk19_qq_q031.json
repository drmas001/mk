Home-based care includes primary care, nursing, social work, and therapeutic modalities delivered by way of home health services, telehealth services by physicians and allied health professionals, and the “hospital-at-home” model, defined as treatment by health care professionals in the patient's home for a condition otherwise requiring acute inpatient hospital care. Home-based care has shown benefit for COPD, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease. Although evidence for mortality benefit is mixed, home-based care has been shown to reduce hospital admissions/readmissions and cost, improve patient satisfaction, and decrease the need for institutionalization. Other advantages include avoidance of hospital-acquired complications and improved preservation of functional status."

"Hospice is a form of palliative medicine that delivers specialized interdisciplinary care to patients with an expected prognosis of 6 months or less. Hospice care can be provided to patients in multiple settings, including the home, skilled nursing facilities, and residential hospice homes. Hospice teams are skilled in managing the symptoms of advanced and terminal illness and improve overall satisfaction with care. Hospice care may be provided in the home and may ultimately be recommended for this patient. However, evaluation of prognosis and discussions regarding goals of care should precede the decision to pursue hospice care (",
