The patient had an embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), based on the infarction on the cortical surface without an alternative source of emboli identified (e.g., large artery atherosclerosis or atrial fibrillation). Prolonged cardiac rhythm evaluation with ambulatory cardiac ECG or an implantable loop recorder may be positive for atrial fibrillation in approximately one third of patients with ESUS and dictate a change in therapy. The patient has several predictors of finding atrial fibrillation, including left atrial enlargement and hypertension."
