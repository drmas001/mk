"), which is approved as initial therapy for neuropathic pain. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (distal symmetric polyneuropathy) typically has an ascending presentation with a “stocking and glove” distribution. It may involve damage to both small and large nerve fibers. Symptoms from small nerve fiber damage include pain, burning, and tingling. Small nerve fiber abnormalities can be detected by assessment of monofilament or pinprick testing and temperature sensations. The treatment goal of diabetic neuropathy is symptom control. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends pregabalin, gabapentin, or duloxetine as initial therapy for neuropathic pain. Head-to-head comparative studies and studies with quality-of-life outcomes are limited, so drug selection must consider the patient's comorbidities, previous treatments, and likelihood of adherence. Pregabalin is the most extensively studied drug for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and most studies reported a 30% to 50% improvement in pain; however, not all trials demonstrated positive results. Gabapentin, a related drug, has also shown efficacy in clinical trials, and is less expensive than pregabalin, but it is not FDA approved for treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy. The selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor duloxetine has also shown efficacy and, in some studies, improved quality of life; however, adverse effects may limit adherence."

A systematic review and meta-analysis found inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of tapentadol in treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, with questionable effectiveness and potential for abuse and addiction, tapentadol is not recommended by the ADA or others as first- or second-line therapy for painful diabetic neuropathy."
