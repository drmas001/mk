"), a chronic inflammatory condition of the pilosebaceous units with increased vascular reactivity. It produces facial erythema with small pink papules and usually presents in the third to sixth decades of life. Burning and stinging may be present. Erythrotelangiectatic (vascular) rosacea is persistent flushing, especially of the central face, with prominent telangiectasias. Papulopustular (inflammatory) rosacea presents with pustules and papules that, unlike those of acne, are not follicularly based. Phymatous rosacea causes bulbous thickening of the nose (rhinophyma). Ocular rosacea results in dry, gritty-feeling eyes and conjunctival injection. Alcohol, heat, sun exposure, and other triggers can cause a transient increase in facial erythema but not rosacea itself. The malar erythema of rosacea includes involvement of the nasolabial folds. This patient has classic characteristics of rosacea, including small pink facial papules, prominent telangiectasias, and heat-induced vascular flushing with involvement of the nasolabial folds."

") is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the pilosebaceous unit (hair follicle and sebaceous gland). Although most common during adolescence, acne can affect patients at any age. The clinical features of acne are open comedones (blackheads), closed comedones (whiteheads), inflammatory papules and pustules, and nodulocystic lesions on the face, neck, chest, shoulders, and back. The papulopustular variant of rosacea can be confused with acne, but rosacea does not present with comedonal lesions."
