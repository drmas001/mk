"). This patient has genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Vaginal symptoms are common in menopause and can include sexual symptoms, such as dyspareunia; vaginal dryness, burning, and itching; and urinary symptoms, such as dysuria and frequent urinary tract infections. The North American Menopause Society recommends initiating nonhormonal therapies as first-line treatment for GSM before considering other therapies, including topical vaginal estrogen therapy. Nonhormonal approaches include as-needed vaginal lubricants for intercourse and vaginal moisturizers that can alleviate vaginal dryness and irritation when used regularly. A daily topical vaginal moisturizer may improve this patient's symptoms of vaginal dryness and itching and pain with sexual intercourse."

") is a treatment option for GSM, but the North American Menopause Society recommends the use of nonhormonal therapies as initial treatment. Women with urinary symptoms of GSM, which this patient does not have, may benefit more from topical estrogen therapy because there is some evidence that topical estrogen therapy can help reduce urinary symptoms, including frequent urinary tract infections. Topical vaginal estrogen is available in three preparations (cream, tablet, or ring) and is not associated with the same risks as systemic estrogen therapy. For women with breast cancer (past or current), topical vaginal estrogen therapy should only be offered in consultation with their oncologist."
