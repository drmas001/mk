"). Numerous studies in the literature have documented excessive use of laboratory studies in the hospital setting in general and in the ICU in particular. Estimates suggest that approximately 20% of laboratory tests obtained in hospitalized patients are not needed, resulting in waste. In addition to the financial impact to the health care system, overutilization invariably results in false-positive test results, leading to further downstream testing. Studies show that excessive blood draws can result in iatrogenic anemia, as is likely the case in this patient. Efforts to reduce unnecessary laboratory testing have the dual benefit of improving patient safety and reducing health care expenditures. Studies have shown that a reduction in laboratory testing does not lead to adverse patient outcomes, and some studies suggest a decrease in hospital lengths of hospital stay and the need for transfusion. The first management step in this patient is to discontinue daily routine laboratory testing. Laboratory testing should only be undertaken in response to specific clinical questions."
