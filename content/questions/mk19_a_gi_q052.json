Hemodynamic status should be assessed in all patients, and resuscitative measures must be initiated with the goal of hemodynamic stabilization before endoscopy. Adequate intravenous access, usually with two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters (minimum 18-gauge), should be established. Hemoglobin levels should be measured in all patients. Intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy should be initiated before endoscopy in patients with nonvariceal UGIB. Upper endoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice to evaluate UGIB and peptic ulcer disease. Patients with UGIB should undergo upper endoscopy within 24 hours of admission following hemodynamic resuscitation; those with rapid bleeding or suspected of having variceal hemorrhage should have the procedure more emergently (within 12 hours). Endoscopy can determine the cause of bleeding and helps to risk-stratify the patient. Lesions at high risk for recurrent bleeding that require endoscopic treatment include actively bleeding peptic ulcers, ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels, and ulcers with adherent clots."
