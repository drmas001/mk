She has no other sleep-related symptoms, no current mood concerns, and no history of depression. She is otherwise healthy."

") is the best treatment option for this patient with problematic sleep-onset insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep. Decreased total sleep time, decreased rapid eye movement (REM) latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and earlier morning awakening are common physiologic changes to the sleep cycle in older adults. Initial evaluation of insomnia should consist of a thorough history and review of sleep hygiene. CBT-I is considered first-line treatment in all adults, including the geriatric population. Therapy can be individual, group, or internet based. There is a lack of evidence for or against any of these modes of CBT-I delivery as being the most effective. An abbreviated version of CBT-I, brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBT-I), focuses on the behavioral components of sleep restriction, stimulus control, and sleep hygiene only. BBT-I also has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic insomnia. In general, pharmacotherapy for sleep should be pursued only after shared decision making between the physician and patient."

RLS is a movement disorder characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs and is transiently relieved by movement. RLS is worse at rest and at night and may prevent sleep or interrupt sleep. This patient does not have symptoms consistent with RLS, and pramipexole should not be used for management of insomnia in patients who do not have RLS."
