She was subsequently diagnosed with widely metastatic, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. No tumor molecular alterations were noted. She has experienced a 30-pound weight loss over the past 7 months. She has been unable to independently perform activities of daily living for the past 4 months. She reports no significant difficulty with pain."

") is the most appropriate management. This patient with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer has poor performance status and should be counseled that supportive care/hospice is in her best interest. Patients with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer can derive significant benefit from treatment, and multiple treatment options are available. These include not just chemotherapy but molecular therapies based on identification of relevant driver mutations and also immunotherapy. Performance status is a means of quantifying how medically fit a patient is overall. A good performance status predicts favorable tolerance and response to treatment. Patients with a poor performance status are much more likely to experience serious or life-threatening toxicity and much less likely to benefit from treatment. In patients with poor performance status and metastatic non–small cell lung cancer, identifying a driver mutation has therapeutic implications. These patients may respond to inhibitors of driver mutations with manageable toxicity and overall benefit. In the absence of driver mutations, combination chemotherapy or immunotherapy is more likely to harm than to help patients with poor performance status."
