"). This patient has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Patients with IPF present with chronic shortness of breath and a dry cough. Patients typically have bibasilar inspiratory Velcro-like crackles, and clubbing is common. The prevalence of disease increases with age. A confident diagnosis can be made based on the presence of typical symptoms and a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on a high-resolution CT scan of the chest. IPF is progressive, with a median survival of 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. In 2014 the FDA approved two medications: pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent, and nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for use in patients with IPF. In clinical trials the two agents were found to have comparable efficacy in mitigating the rate of FVC decline by approximately 50% over the course of 1 year. They have also shown some efficacy in reducing severe respiratory events such as acute exacerbations and hospitalization. Common side effects are anorexia, nausea, photosensitivity (pirfenidone), and diarrhea (nintedanib). Although these medications delay IPF progression, they are not curative. Referral to a pulmonologist or interstitial lung disease center may be appropriate before initiating treatment with these medications. Lung transplantation is a life-prolonging therapy for those without comorbidities that may otherwise limit life expectancy. Early referral of eligible patients to a transplant center is appropriate given the unpredictability of disease progression."
