It manifests as an abrupt decline in mental status, unreactive dilated pupils, and motor weakness with flexor or extensor posturing. This patient also demonstrates the Cushing response (bradycardia and hypertension), a sign of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Emergent treatment includes elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees, hyperventilation (usually with mechanical ventilation) to an arterial P",

Mannitol is a diuretic that reduces brain edema by osmotically transferring water from brain tissue into the circulation, where it is renally excreted. The impact of mannitol on ICP is evident within minutes and peaks in 1 hour. These treatments can be life-saving and often are used as a bridge to emergent surgery."
