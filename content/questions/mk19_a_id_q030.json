"). MAC is the most common cause of chronic lung infection worldwide. Cavitary lung disease is seen classically in middle-aged, or older adult men, especially those with underlying lung disease, such as COPD, who smoke cigarettes. Additionally, because of the relatively indolent nature of MAC lung disease, lung destruction may be quite extensive at the time of diagnosis with very large cavities on chest radiograph. The infection is frequently associated with weight loss and night sweats. The chest radiograph generally reveals classic fibrocavitary changes, and respiratory secretions stain positive for acid-fast bacilli. The patient's negative interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) further supports a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The definitive diagnosis would be achieved by nucleic acid amplification testing or molecular probe to further identify the mycobacteria and grow the organism for susceptibility testing. A variant of MAC lung disease seen in women older than 50 years who develop bronchiectasis is termed nodular or bronchiectatic MAC because nodules and bronchiectasis are typically seen on chest radiograph."
