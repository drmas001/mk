"). Optimal medical therapy, including aggressive risk factor reduction and glucose control, is foundational for patients with diabetes mellitus to reduce the risk for clinical ASCVD events. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American College of Cardiology recommend introducing a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit as part of a glycemic control regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes and clinical ASCVD. If the patient is already taking metformin combined with another therapeutic agent or agents and is not taking an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist, the ADA recommends considering switching to one of these agents, which reduce the risk for ASCVD events regardless of the hemoglobin A",

Use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this population is associated with a 14% reduction in cardiovascular death. Patients with previous amputation, severe peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, or diabetic foot ulcers should exercise caution with canagliflozin and ertugliflozin. It is unclear whether this caution should be applied to all drugs in the class."

Tight glycemic control reduces microvascular complications; however, it does not reduce the risk for myocardial infarction (MI). The use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes has been shown to reduce rates of acute MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death. These benefits seem to be unrelated to their glucose-lowering effects."
