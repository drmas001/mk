"). The foramen ovale, a passage in the superior portion of the fossa ovalis that allows oxygenated placental blood to transfer to the fetal circulation, remains patent in 25% to 30% of the population. Patients are usually asymptomatic. PFO has been identified at increased rates in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source, and several randomized studies have demonstrated that percutaneous PFO closure is more effective for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke than antiplatelet therapy for patients younger than 60 years who have an embolic stroke of undetermined source with PFO. Device closure decreases the risk for recurrent stroke by approximately 60% compared with medical therapy. Current guidelines recommend PFO closure in this population following a discussion of potential benefits (absolute recurrent stroke risk reduction of 3.4% at 5 years) and risks (periprocedural complication rate of 3.9% and increased absolute rate of non-periprocedural atrial fibrillation of 0.33% per year). Data regarding benefit of PFO closure in patients older than 60 years are lacking. However, current guidelines indicate that PFO closure may be considered in patients aged 60 to 65 years with few traditional vascular risk factors for stroke and no other mechanism of stroke detected after a thorough evaluation, including prolonged monitoring for atrial fibrillation."
