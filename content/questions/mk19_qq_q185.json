Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia also can occur with aminoglycoside toxicity due to potassium and magnesium wasting. Recognizing drug-induced ATN is important because eliminating the nephrotoxic agent often leads to renal recovery. Common medications that can cause ATN include other aminoglycosides, vancomycin, cisplatin, contrast agents, mannitol, hydroxyethyl starch, and dextran. ATN can also occur due to cannabinoid and amphetamine use, in addition to pigment deposition. Incidence of toxic ATN increases in older patients and in patients with decreased effective blood volume, chronic kidney disease, or concomitant nephrotoxin exposure, such as vancomycin in this case."

After depositing in the subepithelial area (either within preformed immune complexes or as in-situ immune complex formation), complement activation and subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells occur, leading to a proliferative glomerulonephritis. Patients with IRGN clinically present with acute nephritic syndrome. The patient's urinalysis that shows only granular casts, making IRGN an unlikely diagnosis."
