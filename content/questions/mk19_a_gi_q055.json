"). Elevations in alkaline phosphatase and serum total bilirubin levels and proportionally lesser elevations of aminotransferase levels indicate cholestatic hepatitis, the most common cause of which is drug-induced cholestasis. Drug-induced liver injury can result from exposure to prescription and nonprescription drugs as well as herbal and dietary supplements, even if the exposure occurred 6 months before symptom onset. The likely source of this patient's cholestasis is the amoxicillin-clavulanate she received for diverticulitis. Antibiotics (particularly amoxicillin-clavulanate) and antiepileptic medications (phenytoin and valproate) are among the most common medications associated with drug-induced liver injury, representing 60% of cases. Liver injury typically resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug; resolution of liver injury supports the diagnosis. Jaundice that occurs with cholestatic drug reactions can take months to resolve. Treatment of drug-induced liver disease is largely supportive, with removal of the offending agent. Liver transplantation can be considered in patients who have evidence of liver failure (i.e., those for whom liver injury is associated with encephalopathy and coagulopathy)."
