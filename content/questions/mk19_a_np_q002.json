") for this patient undergoing cardiac catheterization. Multiple patient-related risk factors have been associated with CAN. The primary risk factor is a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Some studies find an added risk of CAN from diabetes mellitus. Well-established additional risk factors include nephrotoxic agents and exposures, hypotension, hypovolemia, albuminuria, and impaired kidney perfusion (e.g., as occurs in heart failure). Although multiple myeloma has historically been considered a risk factor for CAN, this is not supported by more recent literature. A 2020 guideline from the American College of Radiology and the National Kidney Foundation recommends that the risk for CAN be determined primarily by using the chronic kidney disease stage and associated eGFR measurement. Patients at highest risk for CAN include those with recent acute kidney injury and those with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m",
