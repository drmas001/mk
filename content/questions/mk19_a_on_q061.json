"A 48-year-old woman is evaluated following the diagnosis of a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. Two weeks ago, she underwent ultrasonography for biliary colic, which unexpectedly showed multiple hepatic lesions. Gallstones were not present. A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated multiple hypodense lesions in the liver consistent with metastatic disease. A needle biopsy of a liver lesion showed a well-differentiated, low-grade neuroendocrine tumor with only very rare mitotic figures. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The patient feels well without any symptoms, and she takes no medications."

"). This patient has an incidental finding of a well-differentiated, low-grade, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor with multiple metastases to the liver. These tumors are often asymptomatic and indolent, and asymptomatic patients may do well with minimal growth and no symptoms for years without intervention. As such, there is no urgency to intervene, and it is beneficial to evaluate the pace of the disease before making a decision regarding whether to treat. Follow-up examination and imaging at approximately a 3-month interval is appropriate in asymptomatic patients with relatively modest-volume, asymptomatic disease. Approximately one third to one half of metastatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors will elaborate serotonin, a hormone that causes “carcinoid syndrome” with diarrhea and/or facial flushing; however, most patients have a hormonally nonfunctional tumor and so will not require treatment for these symptoms. In patients who have stable disease at the 3-month scan, further monitoring with serial imaging at 3- to 6-month intervals is appropriate."
