") in this patient. A 2020 systematic review and network meta-analysis of 72 trials involving 12,660 patients found that the benefit of gastric acid suppression to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients is finely balanced against harms. There is moderate evidence that compared with placebo, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), but not sucralfate, reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, with PPIs likely to be more effective than H2RAs. Patients at highest risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (risk >4%) benefited the most. Patients at highest risk were identified as those with a coagulopathy, those with chronic liver disease, and those receiving mechanical ventilation but not enteral nutrition. Highest risk patients also included those with two or more of the following risk factors: mechanical ventilation with enteral nutrition, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and shock. Compared with placebo, the absolute difference in bleeding rates for patients at highest risk receiving a PPI was 3.3%. This patient is at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and use of a PPI will decrease this risk."
