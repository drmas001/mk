") to exclude a prostate cancer diagnosis in men older than 40 years before starting testosterone therapy. The AUA also recommends the PSA test for patients with testosterone deficiency who maintain testosterone levels in the normal range, using a shared decision-making approach. The AUA does not recommend routine PSA testing in men aged 40 to 54 years unless they are at higher risk (AUA cited risk factors include positive family history and Black race), for whom PSA testing decisions should be individualized. In men aged 55 to 69 years, biennial PSA testing should be considered. The 2018 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend that men who begin testosterone treatment and are older than age 50 years (or 40 years if at high risk) should be reevaluated for prostate cancer with PSA testing at 3 months and 1 year after beginning treatment and thereafter according to the standard of care. An increase in PSA greater than 1.4 ng/mL (1.4 μg/L) at 1 year or greater than 0.4 ng/mL (0.4 μg/L) after 6 months of testosterone use or abnormal results on digital rectal examination should prompt further investigation for prostate cancer. A hematocrit level should also be obtained at baseline and then at 3 months and 6 months after therapy initiation, followed by yearly measurements."
