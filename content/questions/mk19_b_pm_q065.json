"). This patient has developed malignant hyperthermia after receiving succinylcholine. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by diffuse skeletal muscle activation that results from intracellular calcium release. It is triggered most often by inhaled anesthetics and the depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine. Presenting signs and symptoms reflect hypermetabolism and include muscle rigidity (including masseter muscle rigidity), tachycardia, tachypnea, laboratory evidence of rhabdomyolysis (elevated serum creatine kinase, potassium, and phosphorus levels and myoglobinuria), and temperature that can be strikingly high, 45.0 째C (113.0 째F) or more. Mortality can reach 10%. Treatment consists of discontinuing the triggering agent, active cooling, and administration of the muscle relaxant dantrolene every 5 to 10 minutes until muscle rigidity and hyperthermia resolve. Dantrolene interferes with intracellular calcium release and is considered an antidote to malignant hyperthermia. Patients should be monitored in the ICU for 24 hours following an episode of malignant hyperthermia."

"), a serotonin and histamine antagonist, is sometimes used off-label to treat serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a less severe hyperthermic reaction triggered by simultaneous use of two or more medications that affect release or reuptake of serotonin. Unlike neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome usually includes hyperreflexia and myoclonus, does not result in muscle rigidity, and generally resolves spontaneously after 24 hours. Cyproheptadine does not have a role in the treatment of malignant hyperthermia."
