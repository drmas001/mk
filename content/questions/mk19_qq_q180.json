") caused by doxycycline, which is acidic and may cause mucosal burn and ulceration. Typical symptoms of pill-induced esophagitis include retrosternal pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. The injury usually occurs at sites of anatomic narrowing of the esophagus, such as the aortic arch, the gastroesophageal junction, or the esophageal indentation caused by an enlarged left atrium. Symptoms may begin hours to days after therapy is started. GERD increases the risk for pill-induced esophagitis by providing an acidic environment and decreasing esophageal motility, which prolongs the pill contact time with the esophageal mucosa. Other risk factors include decreased salivary output, large pills, medications that increase the lower esophageal sphincter tone (opioids, anticholinergic agents), ingestion of medications in the supine position, and taking pills without adequate water ingestion. Tetracyclines, aspirin, NSAIDs, iron preparations, quinidine, potassium, and bisphosphonates have been identified as causative agents. Treatment includes avoiding the culprit medication, if possible. It is unclear if antacids, histamine-2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), or sucralfate are beneficial. PPIs are used if GERD is an associated comorbid condition. Preventive strategies to decrease pill-induced esophagitis include drinking plenty of water and remaining upright for 30 minutes after taking the medication."

") is a hypercontractile state presenting with dysphagia for liquids and solids and may be associated with chest pain. Symptoms often respond to nitroglycerin, suggesting a flaw in esophageal nitric oxide production. The esophagus has a “corkscrew” or “rosary bead” appearance on esophagography. Esophageal manometry shows simultaneous high-amplitude (>30 mm Hg) esophageal contractions with intermittent aperistaltic contractions. This patient's symptoms of chest pain and odynophagia after starting doxycycline are a much more compelling history for pill-induced esophagitis."
