This patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II symptoms, as evidenced by dyspnea with moderate exertion, is stable and has no evidence of volume overload on examination. In the PARADIGM-HF trial of patients with symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, valsartan-sacubitril reduced mortality and heart failure hospitalization by 20% compared with enalapril. Based on this study, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure guidelines recommend replacing an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with valsartan-sacubitril in patients with chronic symptomatic HFrEF. In addition, for patients with new-onset heart failure, directly initiating valsartan-sacubitril, rather than a pretreatment period with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, is a safe and effective strategy in patients with HFrEF. Because of the risk for angioedema, ACE inhibitors (but not ARBs) should be discontinued at least 36 hours before starting valsartan-sacubitril."

Common indications for permanent pacemaker implantation include symptomatic bradycardia without reversible cause; permanent atrial fibrillation with symptomatic bradycardia; alternating bundle branch block; and complete heart block, high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block, irrespective of symptoms. This patient is bradycardic at baseline, does not mount a tachycardic response to activity on ambulatory ECG monitoring, and has low energy. There is no threshold that defines an inadequate heart rate response; it is determined by symptoms suggesting that the heart rate is not meeting the patient's physiologic demands. A common challenge among these patients, many of whom are older, is differentiating between age-related decline in physical activity and pathologic, symptomatic sinus node dysfunction. The former is less likely to improve with cardiac pacing, and the latter often improves dramatically. In this case, the patient is very active, with distinct loss of energy and ECG findings of sinus bradycardia. Recent stress test results confirm normal left ventricular function and no ischemia; thus, cardiac pacing is the next appropriate step."

Patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias (>30 seconds) or cardiac arrest without a reversible cause have a class 1 recommendation for secondary prevention with ICD placement. Despite her normal left ventricular function, an ICD is warranted before discharge, barring a clear, acute contraindication (e.g., active bacteremia). ICDs are indicated and effective in the setting of secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, even if the cause is not confirmed (unless it is very clear that the cause is acutely reversible and correctable). However, her presentation is not unusual for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited “wear-and-tear” disorder that primarily affects the right ventricle but may be seen in the left. Ventricular arrhythmias are often the initial presentation, and some are very dramatic (as in this case); they are also very likely to recur. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging would be helpful to assess myocardial infiltration, ideally before ICD placement. A major facet of her treatment will be exertional limitation, often a major challenge for patients who are athletes."

For patients with diabetes, studies have shown a reduction in cardiovascular events, including heart failure–related mortality and hospitalizations, with use of these agents. SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) seem to reduce the risk for heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death by 1.9% and death from any cause by 2.3%, independent of glucose control. The mechanisms of this reduction are unclear but are thought to be independent of increased diuresis due to glucose excretion.

Therefore, in the absence of contraindications, antiplatelet therapy in the form of low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg/d) is indicated indefinitely for secondary prevention to reduce the risk for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death.

No additional evaluation is necessary because this patient's PVCs are asymptomatic and not accompanied by other signs or symptoms of cardiopulmonary disease. Ambulatory ECG monitoring for assessment of PVC burden may be performed, but in an asymptomatic patient, results are unlikely to affect management. Asymptomatic PVCs, even at higher burden, are common in the general population and may vary dramatically throughout the day and/or from day to day. They may be influenced by stress, alcohol or caffeine intake, sleep disturbances, and comorbid conditions, such as thyroid disorders or anemia. In the absence of a significant comorbid condition and/or symptoms, reassurance is appropriate. Among patients with a consistently very high burden of PVCs (≥15%-20%) that are asymptomatic, periodic echocardiographic monitoring for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy may be considered, but there is no consensus on this surveillance."

All current ASCVD primary prevention guidelines recommend calculation of the 10-year ASCVD risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations, which are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, include race as a variable in estimating cardiovascular risk.

Early clopidogrel loading has been recommended in patients with ACS regardless of reperfusion or revascularization strategy. In patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of NSTE-ACS, risk assessment is indicated to select the treatment strategy. Several risk criteria and scores are available. The TIMI risk score includes seven independent predictors for death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or ischemia requiring revascularization at 14 days, with 1 point assigned for each of these predictors: age 65 years or older, three or more coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors (cholesterol, family history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking), previously documented CAD (angiographic stenosis >50%), aspirin use in the past 7 days, two or more ischemic episodes in the past 24 hours, ST-segment deviation on ECG, and elevated cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase-MB or troponin). This patient presents with features consistent with possible ACS but has a TIMI score of 1 and is clinically stable. Low-risk patients undergo noninvasive stress testing with left ventricular function assessment before hospital discharge. Cardiac catheterization is reserved for patients with active or intermittent ischemia, including those with angina despite medical therapy or evidence of ischemia on stress testing, and patients at very high clinical risk based on risk score. The ischemia-guided approach is appropriate for low-risk patients (TIMI score <2), particularly low-risk women, who may have worse outcomes with an early invasive approach."

In a randomized trial, the addition of very low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) to aspirin (81 mg daily) was shown to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The absolute risk reduction, when compared with aspirin alone, was 2% in 7470 patients enrolled with either lower extremity PAD or carotid stenosis. Major bleeding, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding, was increased by 1% in patients assigned to aspirin plus rivaroxaban. Thus, low-dose rivaroxaban should be avoided in patients with PAD who have a higher risk for bleeding. It should be noted that use of rivaroxaban in patients with PAD is at odds with the 2016 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) PAD guideline, which recommends against anticoagulation to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events in patients with PAD due to lack of benefit and increased risk for harm from major bleeding events, including intracranial bleeding. The studies that informed the AHA/ACC recommendation used warfarin as the anticoagulant."

SCAD involves development of a nontraumatic and noniatrogenic intramural hematoma, with or without intimal dissection with luminal communication. The enlarging hematoma in the false lumen compresses the true lumen of the coronary artery and if combined with obstructing dissection, leads to chest pain, ischemia, and/or infarction. Indicative findings on coronary angiography, including multiple radiolucent lumens and periluminal contrast staining, are absent in this patient."

Patients often have repeated episodes of tachycardia and may report palpitations, a sensation of pounding in the neck, fatigue, light-headedness, chest discomfort, dyspnea, presyncope, and, less commonly, syncope. AVNRT accounts for approximately two thirds of all cases of SVT. It frequently occurs in women and is often terminated by performing vagal maneuvers, as with this patient.

GDMT includes a β-blocker, an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and an aldosterone antagonist. Loop diuretics are used as needed. GDMT improves symptoms and prolongs life in patients with heart failure and probably does so when heart failure is complicated by chronic secondary MR.

It requires ABI measurements at rest and after treadmill walking or plantar flexion exercises. A post-exercise ankle pressure drop of 30 mm Hg or more or significant decline in the ABI suggests PAD."

Recurrence occurs in 15% to 30% of pericarditis cases, and the recurrence rate is higher when initial therapy does not include colchicine. In patients initially treated only with NSAIDs, it would be reasonable to use the combination of NSAIDs and colchicine to treat a recurrence. In patients initially treated with both colchicine and NSAIDs, the addition of a low to moderate dose of prednisone is reasonable to achieve better control of symptoms. When patients re-present with pain but without other evidence of pericarditis, cardiac CT or MRI and measurement of C-reactive protein level may inform the decision of whether to add glucocorticoids. Infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, must be excluded before starting a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are not recommended as first-line therapy for acute pericarditis."

It may result in reversible cardiotoxicity that manifests as left ventricular systolic dysfunction, causing symptoms of heart failure in 3% to 7% of patients. Routine surveillance imaging with echocardiography may be offered during treatment in asymptomatic patients at increased risk for cardiac dysfunction. The 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) practice guideline recommends echocardiography as the surveillance imaging modality of choice. ASCO identifies patients receiving trastuzumab as having increased risk for cardiac dysfunction if any of the following are present: two or more traditional cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and obesity), older age (≥60 years) at cancer treatment, borderline left ventricular ejection fraction (50% to 55%), history of myocardial infarction, moderate or greater valvular heart disease, and treatment combined with lower-dose anthracycline. This patient has three risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and borderline ejection fraction) and should undergo echocardiographic surveillance. ASCO recommends that the frequency of cardiac imaging for each patient be determined by the patient's physician on the basis of clinical judgment and patient circumstances. Common practice includes a baseline evaluation and repeat imaging at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after trastuzumab initiation. ASCO suggests that an echocardiogram be obtained between 6 and 12 months after completion of cancer-directed therapy in asymptomatic patients considered to be at increased risk."

Techniques such as fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio provide information on the functional hemodynamic significance of indeterminate lesions identified on angiographic imaging, reducing both unnecessary stenting and the need for urgent revascularization. In contrast, in unstable or in many acute presentations, revascularization is indicated to prevent future events and improve survival. The risks and benefits of and alternatives to angiography should be discussed, along with potential findings and therapeutic options. Other indications for coronary artery imaging include the presence of clinical findings or indications on noninvasive testing that are associated with severe ischemic heart disease.

Alternatives include intravenous dopamine or epinephrine or transcutaneous pacing, which is painful. Ultimately, the goal is to determine the underlying cause of his acute condition. The bradycardia may be either the cause or the result of his decompensation. Pathologic sinus bradycardia is most commonly caused by sinus node dysfunction due to age-related myocardial fibrosis. Less commonly, sinus node dysfunction may result from right coronary ischemia, hypothyroidism, intracranial hypertension, postoperative scarring or fibrosis from cardiothoracic surgery, or infiltrative or inflammatory disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis).

SCAD involves development of a nontraumatic and non-iatrogenic intramural hematoma with or without intimal dissection with luminal communication. The enlarging hematoma in the false lumen compresses the true lumen of the coronary artery and in potential combination with obstructing dissection leads to chest pain, ischemia, and/or infarction. The diagnosis requires coronary CT or coronary angiography to confirm the characteristic imaging features. When associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, SCAD may be managed invasively; however, percutaneous coronary intervention may be safely deferred when coronary flow is preserved and symptoms can be controlled and closely monitored."

PFO has been identified at increased rates in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source, and several randomized studies have demonstrated that percutaneous PFO closure is more effective for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke than antiplatelet therapy for patients younger than 60 years who have an embolic stroke of undetermined source with PFO. Device closure decreases the risk for recurrent stroke by approximately 60% compared with medical therapy. Current guidelines recommend PFO closure in this population following a discussion of potential benefits (absolute recurrent stroke risk reduction of 3.4% at 5 years) and risks (periprocedural complication rate of 3.9% and increased absolute rate of non-periprocedural atrial fibrillation of 0.33% per year). Data regarding benefit of PFO closure in patients older than 60 years are lacking.

Acute resuscitation of patients with RV ischemic dysfunction is aimed at reversing the resultant decrease in left ventricular (LV) preload and subsequent reduction in cardiac output. Prompt reperfusion followed by intravenous volume expansion with up to several liters of intravenous fluids increases right ventricular preload and contractility, thus increasing flow through the pulmonary circuit into the left atrium and ultimately enhancing LV preload and cardiac output.

Guidelines from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/U.S. Department of Defense recommend at least moderate-intensity statin therapy for the secondary prevention of ASCVD. As many as 45% of patients with PAD are not prescribed or do not fill a prescription for statin medications. Patients with PAD may confuse symptoms of intermittent claudication with adverse effects of statins (namely myalgia), which may contribute to the low adherence rate. The most appropriate treatment is patient education and reintroduction of atorvastatin."

Transthoracic echocardiography reveals normal right and left ventricular size and systolic function despite prominent symptoms and findings suggestive of heart failure. Dilatation of the inferior vena cava reflects elevated right-sided filling (right atrial) pressure. Doppler echocardiography and tissue Doppler velocity are required to differentiate constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Although an underlying cause of constrictive pericarditis is not always identified, previous pericarditis, cardiac surgery, chest irradiation, connective tissue disorders, and uremia are common precipitants."

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a syndrome characterized by transient regional systolic ventricular dysfunction mimicking myocardial infarction (reduced ejection fraction, elevated cardiac enzymes, and signs of ischemia on ECG) in the absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. In most cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the regional wall motion abnormality extends beyond the territory perfused by a single epicardial coronary artery. The syndrome is often precipitated by extreme emotional stress, such as death of a loved one. The pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unknown, but the condition is postulated to result from reversible myocardial toxicity induced by very high catecholamine levels. Women are affected more frequently than are men. Treatment is generally supportive and is similar to that for heart failure of other causes; most patients recover cardiac function over several months.

This patient's diagnosis of PAD was confirmed by a low ABI in both lower extremities (0.80 on the right and 0.86 on the left), and he does not require additional testing. He is being treated appropriately with guideline-directed medical therapy, including two antiplatelet agents, a β-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a statin. There is also a 45–mm Hg difference in arm blood pressures in this patient. Although a difference in arm systolic pressures of greater than 15 to 20 mm Hg suggests subclavian or innominate artery stenosis, in the absence of symptoms (arm claudication or symptoms of vertebral artery steal), no further imaging or intervention is warranted."

This distinction affects the patient's ability to continue to participate in athletics as well as the consideration of further testing and treatment. Structural adaptations of the left ventricle in response to rigorous training include dilatation and increased wall thickness; these findings do not necessarily indicate pathology. In a study of elite athletes, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameters ranged from 38 to 66 mm in women (mean, 48 mm) and from 43 to 70 mm in men (mean, 55 mm). Markedly dilated LV chambers (>60 mm) were most common in athletes with higher body mass and those participating in endurance sports. Increased wall thickness is common, but wall thickness greater than 13 mm is uncommon in elite athletes and should raise suspicion for possible underlying pathology. LV diastolic filling in athletes is most often normal but may show enhanced passive LV filling. Abnormal diastolic filling patterns are more common in patients with pathologic conditions. LV ejection fraction is usually normal in athletes."

In this population, both drugs are associated with reduced rates of adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death.

Symptomatic patients with inferior MI and transient heart block may be treated with temporary pacing because conduction block in this setting, including Mobitz type 1 and complete heart block, is caused by high vagal tone affecting the atrioventricular (AV) node, is generally transient, and is accompanied by an adequate escape rhythm. Whereas temporary pacing support may occasionally be necessary, permanent pacing (",

Vagally mediated heart block occurring at the AV node must be distinguished from the less benign and potentially lethal Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block, which occurs more frequently in the setting of extensive anterior MI and damage to the conduction system below the AV node. Although Mobitz type 1 block occurs at the AV node and is identified by cyclical, repetitive prolongation of the PR interval leading to a “dropped beat” and a regularly irregular rhythm, Mobitz type 2 block is typified by block conduction without associated PR prolongation and may predispose to extended periods of asystole, requiring permanent pacemaker support."

The systolic click and radiation of the murmur to the back suggest posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation (MR) with prolapse (primary MR). Despite these findings, the quantitative echocardiographic data are consistent with moderate MR. However, two-dimensional quantitative echocardiographic data may underestimate the severity of MR. In that case, additional imaging is required. In patients with primary MR, if transthoracic echocardiography provides insufficient or discordant information, current guidelines recommend either transesophageal echocardiography or CMR imaging to assess the severity of MR (class 1 recommendations). This assessment is important in determining whether mitral valve intervention is indicated.

The anterior wall motion abnormality increases suspicion for coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common underlying cause of heart failure. The patient also has exertional chest heaviness; thus, clinical suspicion for CAD should be high.

The transannular patch disrupts integrity of the pulmonary valve, resulting in severe pulmonary regurgitation, which in turn causes right heart enlargement, tricuspid regurgitation, exercise limitation, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.

In one meta-analysis, the incidence of ibrutinib-associated atrial fibrillation was 5.77 per 100 person-years, much higher than in the general population. New-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with cancer is associated with increased risk for heart failure and thromboembolism. β-Blockers are usually used safely for rate control. Although diltiazem and verapamil are effective in blocking the atrioventricular node, they are moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, and they may significantly increase plasma levels of ibrutinib through this mechanism. Ibrutinib increases digoxin plasma levels, which may increase the potential for digoxin toxicity."

Among patients aged 55 years or older with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of undetermined source, occult intermittent atrial fibrillation (AF) is thought to be present in up to 25% of cases, and prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring may be indicated for detection. According to the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society AF focused update, in a patient with an ischemic stroke of unknown cause in whom external ambulatory ECG monitoring is inconclusive, implantation of a cardiac monitor (loop recorder) is reasonable to optimize detection of silent AF (class 2a recommendation). The 2019 guideline on the management of acute stroke from the American Heart Association/American Academy of Neurology notes that the effectiveness of prolonged cardiac monitoring during hospitalization after acute ischemic stroke to guide treatment selection for prevention of recurrent stroke is uncertain. However, there is some practice variation regarding the duration of “prolonged” monitoring and the burden of detected, asymptomatic AF that warrants anticoagulation. Also, the sequence of evaluation varies—for example, extended rhythm monitoring first versus testing for intracardiac shunt with transesophageal echocardiography."

Patients with a mechanical cardiac valve require antithrombotic therapy for thromboembolic prophylaxis. Given the increased thrombogenicity associated with mechanical versus bioprosthetic cardiac valves, antithrombotic management requires anticoagulant therapy rather than antiplatelet monotherapy. With the advent of direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban), there has been interest in using these agents in patients with mechanical and bioprosthetic cardiac valves. However, given the data from the randomized RE-ALIGN trial, which showed that dabigatran was associated with excess bleeding and thromboembolic events compared with warfarin, dabigatran (",

Instead, warfarin and/or aspirin should be used, depending on valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical) and position (aortic, mitral, pulmonary, or tricuspid). With mechanical valves in the mitral position, guidelines recommend anticoagulation with warfarin, with a goal INR of 3.0. A range of 2.5 to 3.5 is acceptable to balance the risks of under- and over-anticoagulation in a patient with a mechanical mitral valve."

For adult patients with HCM and one or more major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD), offering an ICD is reasonable (class 2a recommendation). Risk factors include SCD judged definitively or likely attributable to HCM in one or more first-degree or close relatives aged 50 years or younger, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of 30 mm or greater in any LV segment, one or more recent episodes of syncope suspected by clinical history to be arrhythmic in nature, LV apical aneurysm, and LV ejection fraction less than 50%.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated that aggressive efforts to achieve rhythm control in patients with AF and concomitant heart failure decrease morbidity and mortality. In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, recent clinical trials have shown that catheter ablation of AF is associated with a favorable effect on morbidity and mortality compared with medical therapy. Amiodarone is another option for rhythm control. Although amiodarone carries a risk for toxicity, this patient's lifetime exposure to the drug is likely to be relatively low given her age, comorbid conditions, and probable amiodarone dosage, which is generally lower for AF than for ventricular arrhythmias. Monitored appropriately, it can be used safely and effectively in patients her age."

"). This patient's presenting symptom of acute anterior chest pain suggests acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection. In this patient, aortic dissection is most likely because of the significant differences in systolic blood pressures between the right and left arms. In addition, the grade 3/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left sternal border indicates the presence of aortic regurgitation (AR). In the setting of suspected aortic dissection, the presence of new or worsened AR suggests aortic root involvement, which constitutes a surgical emergency. Transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is indicated to confirm the presence, severity, and etiology of acute AR. CT angiography is indicated in patients with acute aortic dissection because it is highly accurate and rapidly available. TEE may be used when CT imaging is unavailable and is helpful in assessment of aortic valve function before and after the surgical intervention."

Furthermore, coronary artery catheterization will not address aortic dissection. Thus, if aortic dissection is being considered, CT angiography is preferred to coronary artery catheterization."

Pulsus paradoxus represents exaggerated ventricular interdependence and is a key clinical feature of cardiac tamponade. It is characterized by a fall in systolic pressure of greater than 10 mm Hg during inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus is not specific for tamponade and must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and echocardiographic features. If the fluid has accumulated slowly, the cardiac silhouette is typically enlarged on chest radiograph. This patient's findings should prompt urgent evaluation for cardiac tamponade and treatment if present. Echocardiography to evaluate for the presence, distribution, and relative volume of pericardial fluid is important to establish the diagnosis."
