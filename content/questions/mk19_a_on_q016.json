"). The best available data regarding the safety of pregnancy after breast cancer come from matched cohort studies and have found that women with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive and ER-negative breast cancer who become pregnant after breast cancer treatment have outcomes no worse than women who do not become pregnant. These data suggest concerns that pregnancy, a high estrogen state, would increase the risk of recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer are unfounded. Consensus guidelines indicate that pregnancy after breast cancer should not be discouraged. Fertility is a very important survivorship issue and should be discussed with all patients of reproductive age before beginning cancer treatment. Fertility preservation options, including embryo and oocyte cryopreservation, should be discussed as options to preserve fertility before gonadotoxic treatment. Breast cancer survivors' fertility can be diminished as a direct result of chemotherapy, particularly alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide; however, other drugs including taxanes and platinum chemotherapy may also have an impact on fertility. Trastuzumab and endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen or ovarian suppression, are not believed to directly impair fertility, although the delay in pregnancy to complete endocrine therapy may be associated with reduced fertility due to an age-related decline in ovarian reserve. The standard for patients with ER-positive breast cancer is to complete the recommended full course of endocrine therapy before trying to conceive."
