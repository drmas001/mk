"). Symptoms caused by hyponatremia depend on both the rapidity and degree of decline in serum sodium. A sudden drop in serum sodium causes water to move into the brain, producing cerebral edema and possibly causing headaches, seizures, or death. Hyponatremia has been reported in inexperienced marathon runners who overhydrate. A systematic study of hyponatremia in runners finishing a marathon revealed that 13% had a serum sodium concentration of ≤135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L) and 0.6% had critical hyponatremia of ≤120 mEq/L (120 mmol/L). Hyponatremia was associated with consumption of more than 3 liters of fluids during the race, consumption of fluids every mile, and a racing time of more than 4 hours, which is a possible indication of less training. Female runners remain a readily identifiable risk group in many studies, but this may represent the impact of body size and longer racing time rather than the sex of the athlete. The other major factor causing hyponatremia in endurance athletes is persistent secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Because hyponatremia is not uncommon with extreme exercise and overhydration, it is important that medical personnel are able to measure sodium rapidly. If the patient's sodium cannot be measured, treatment should be held until the patient can be transported to a facility where sodium measurements can be made. Individuals with severe symptoms (e.g., confusion, coma, seizures) secondary to acute hyponatremia should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of 3% saline. If symptoms do not improve and the sodium remains low, an additional bolus can be given."
