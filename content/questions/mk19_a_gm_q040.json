"). This patient probably has functional incontinence due to dementia and decreased mobility. His dementia prevents him from understanding when he needs to urinate, and his mobility issues prevent him from reaching the toilet in time. In a patient with functional incontinence related to cognitive impairment, behavioral therapy with prompted voiding is the appropriate management. With prompted voiding, the patient is asked at regular intervals (every 2 to 4 hours) whether he needs to void, and assistance is provided in getting to the toilet, as is positive reinforcement for urinating in the toilet. Prompted voiding can promote improved bladder control. It reduces incontinence in older patients who have caregivers as well as in patients in assisted living or skilled nursing facilities."

"Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may experience lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). LUTS can be divided into symptoms that are obstructive (hesitancy, weakened stream, straining, incomplete emptying, urinary retention, overflow incontinence) or irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia). 5α-Reductase inhibitors (finasteride [",

"] and dutasteride) block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; this leads to a reduction in prostate size and thus improvement in LUTS. Finasteride is initiated when symptoms fail to respond to first-line therapy with α-blockers (tamsulosin, terazosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin, silodosin) or the patient has a contraindication to α-blocker use. This patient with functional incontinence is unlikely to improve with the addition of finasteride."

This patient's urinary incontinence stems from his inability to understand the need to void and inability to maneuver to the bathroom.
