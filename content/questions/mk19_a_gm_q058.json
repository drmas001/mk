"). Advance care planning is the process by which a patient articulates preferences, goals, and values regarding his or her future medical care. Advance care planning should consist of ongoing conversations between the patient, the physician, and loved ones to inform decisions and direct medical care in the event that the patient loses decision-making capacity. These conversations should be a routine component of care and ideally occur before an acute event or medical crisis."

") who will be empowered to carry out the wishes of the patient if he becomes incapacitated. The health care proxy will be guided by the patient's wishes articulated in the living will. If the patient fails to identify a health care proxy, or the designated proxy refuses to accept the role, most states have laws that provide a hierarchy of preferred surrogates based on their relationship to the patient (typically in the sequence of spouse, adult child, parent, and adult sibling). Physicians should be familiar with laws regarding surrogate decision making in the state in which they practice. Should this patient fail to assign a health care proxy, his daughter may be his legally designated surrogate. However, the patient should be advised to engage in advance care planning to designate the proxy that he wishes. In this case, that decision has yet to be made."
