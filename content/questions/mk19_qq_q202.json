"). In asymptomatic postmenopausal women and men with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), the American Gastroenterological Association recommends bidirectional endoscopy. Patients with IDA should always be evaluated for the underlying cause. Iron deficiency may result from blood loss or malabsorption. In men and nonmenstruating women, gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss is always the presumed cause of iron deficiency unless proven otherwise. Although this patient has no history of GI bleeding and the result of a single fecal occult blood test is negative, he still might have intermittent microscopic bleeding that may have been missed. Many GI causes, such as peptic ulcer disease, colon cancer, and varices, can be evaluated by endoscopy."
