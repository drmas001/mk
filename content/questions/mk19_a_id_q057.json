"-associated infection is usually foodborne, often following consumption of inadequately cooked poultry. The incubation period is about 3 days, and symptoms typically include diarrhea (visibly bloody in approximately 15% of patients), crampy abdominal pain, and fever. Stool culture and molecular testing can be used for diagnosis, although culture is needed to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of the organism. Diarrhea usually resolves spontaneously without antibiotics. However, patients who have severe disease (bloody stools, bacteremia, high fever, or prolonged [>1 week] symptoms) or are at risk for severe disease, including immunocompromised persons, pregnant patients, or older adults, should receive antibiotic therapy. When indicated, macrolide therapy with azithromycin is preferred empirically because of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, particularly in certain geographic locations, including Southeast Asia.
