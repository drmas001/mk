Her symptoms have woken her once in the past month. She reports no additional symptoms and no environmental triggers. She is a nonsmoker. Inhaler technique is good."

A step up in therapy is indicated for inadequate asthma control, including either use of a SABA more than twice weekly (not related to prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm) or need for a SABA two or more times monthly for nocturnal symptoms. Guidelines indicate that the preferred next step is combined therapy with a low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid and LABA in a single inhaler. When LABAs are added to inhaled glucocorticoids, they provide improved control and decrease the risk of exacerbations. Administration in a single inhaler is preferred because it improves adherence and may reduce cost compared with administration of each drug in a separate inhaler. Other treatment options would include increasing the patient's regimen to a medium-dose inhaled glucocorticoid or adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist to her current dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid."
