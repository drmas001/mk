"). Many laboratories use the “reverse” serologic testing strategy for syphilis, starting with an automated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a nonspecific test (rapid plasma reagin [RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Lab [VDRL] test). Patients with a positive EIA result but negative RPR or VDRL test result should have a second specific treponemal antibody test to confirm the result. Those with a confirmed positive result and no history of syphilis treatment should be offered treatment for syphilis of unknown duration with benzathine penicillin once weekly for three doses. In this patient, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) confirmed a diagnosis of chlamydia proctitis, so the empiric treatment provided with ceftriaxone and azithromycin would have been sufficient to treat that infection."

This long oral regimen is much less desirable than three weekly injections of benzathine penicillin."
