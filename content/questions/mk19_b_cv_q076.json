Cancer survivors who received such radiotherapy are at risk for the late development of cardiovascular complications, including pericardial constriction, valvular heart disease, and coronary artery disease. Stenosis is often ostial within the coronary arteries and may be more fibrous or fibrocalcific than typical atheroma. Anginal symptoms, especially in women, may not be typical. Given the exertional nature of this patient's symptoms and the lack of other features supporting a pericardial or valvular underlying cause, a high index of suspicion should be maintained for ischemic disease."
