"). The initial test in patients with a history of palpitations, presyncope, or syncope when an arrhythmia is suspected should be 12-lead resting ECG. The ECG may show evidence of preexcitation, ectopic rhythms, atrioventricular block, or intraventricular conduction delay, which can provide insight into the cause of the symptoms. Other conditions that might be suspected from the 12-lead resting ECG include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (marked left ventricular hypertrophy and deep septal Q waves in leads I, aVL, and V",

Ventricular tachycardia also might be suspected if the ECG demonstrated a prolonged QT interval. The need for further testing is determined by the ECG findings and suspicion of structural or functional heart disease."

") is useful for infrequent symptoms that are thought to be related to an arrhythmia. Use of an event monitor is ideal when symptoms last longer than 1 to 2 minutes so that patients can activate the monitor in time for the symptoms to be recorded. These monitors can be carried around and then held to the chest when symptoms occur or attached to the chest via electrodes. However, even if the 12-lead resting ECG were normal, this patient has frequent symptoms, occurring daily. In this situation, a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitor would be a more suitable diagnostic test than an event monitor."

It may be that this patient will require 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, but the initial test remains 12-lead resting ECG."
