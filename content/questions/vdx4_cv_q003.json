MAT is most commonly seen in acutely ill patients, most often in the setting of pulmonary disease, such as an exacerbation of COPD with associated hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities. The ECG in MAT is defined by the presence of discrete P waves with at least three different morphologic patterns and varying P-P, P-R, and R-R intervals, as ",

". The rate is greater than 100 beats per minute, distinguishing MAT from wandering atrial pacemaker. The rhythm is irregular; however, unlike in atrial fibrillation, P waves are detectable, and there is a 1:1 relationship of each P wave to a QRS complex. Therapy is directed at the underlying disease process because without treatment of the underlying cause, the arrhythmia is often refractory to therapy or may recur."
