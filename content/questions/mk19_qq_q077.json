The most common cause is elevated postprandial blood glucose levels. The possibility of postprandial hyperglycemia should be assessed by measuring blood glucose levels 2 hours after meals several times each week. If elevated blood glucose levels are noted postprandially, the addition of a mealtime rapid-acting insulin analogue, such as insulin aspart, insulin lispro, or insulin glulisine, is appropriate. These insulin preparations, which have peak action within 30 to 90 minutes and duration of action of 2 to 4 hours, successfully modulate the postprandial rise in glucose."
