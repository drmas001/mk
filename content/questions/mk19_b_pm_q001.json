Nurses provide frequent orientation, and she has been provided with her glasses and hearing aids. Medications are ceftriaxone, acetaminophen, carvedilol, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril."

"). Delirium is characterized by an acute change in cognitive functioning occurring over hours to days, with fluctuations during the course of the day. Features of delirium include inattention, disorganized thinking, executive dysfunction, altered level of consciousness (lethargy or hypervigilance), perceptual disturbances (hallucinations or delusions), altered psychomotor activity (hyperactivity, hypoactivity, or alternating periods of hyperactivity and hypoactivity), sleep-wake disturbances, and labile mood. It is extremely common in patients in the ICU and is associated with increased length of ICU stay, morbidity, mortality, and cognitive impairment. Risk factors for delirium include preexisting dementia, hypertension, alcoholism, and high severity of illness on ICU admission. Patients should be monitored regularly and assessed using scales such as the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Measures to decrease the risk of delirium include early mobilization, preservation of nocturnal sleep, adequate pain management, orientation of the patient, provision of visual and hearing aids, and minimization of nonessential medications. Early mobilization, consisting of interruption of sedation followed by physical and occupational therapy in the earliest days of critical illness, can be effective for treating and preventing delirium."

Thus, minimizing factors that are known to increase the risk for delirium remains the main focus of care of critically ill patients."
