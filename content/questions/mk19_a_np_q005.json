"). Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at increased risk for renal cell carcinoma compared with the general population. Acquired cystic changes of the kidney are common in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESKD and are at risk for malignant transformation. Risk factors for acquired cystic kidney disease include longer duration of ESKD and dialysis and male sex. For patients with ESKD and acquired kidney cysts, decisions about screening must be individualized based on the competing issues of risk for renal cell carcinoma versus a shortened overall life expectancy. This young patient is a kidney transplant candidate with extended life expectancy. His kidney ultrasound confirms the presence of acquired cysts, a few of which are complex with internal septations; however, there is no evidence of malignant change with no solid components or neovascularization. This patient should have annual ultrasonography of the kidneys to monitor for malignant conversion and undergo nephrectomy if a suspicious mass develops."

"), even in the presence of known acquired cystic kidney disease. The American Society of Nephrology's Choosing Wisely Campaign recommends not screening for malignancy in patients with reduced life expectancy. However, because of the increased risk for renal cell carcinoma in this patient population, development of symptoms or signs consistent with renal cell carcinoma should be investigated. For example, spontaneous improvement in hemoglobin is suspicious for renal cell carcinomaâ€“related erythropoietin production."
