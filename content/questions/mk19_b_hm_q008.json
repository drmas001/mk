"). She presents with signs of a bleeding diathesis. Her prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times, elevated INR, low fibrinogen level, and elevated fibrin degradation products are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Although anemia and thrombocytopenia from marrow infiltration can be associated with any acute leukemia, presentation with DIC is unique to APL. In APL, normal leukocyte differentiation is blocked at the promyelocyte stage, which can be detected on the peripheral blood smear. Auer rods can occasionally be seen in any AML but are classic in the APL variant."

Patients present with malaise, thrombocytopenic bleeding, infections, bone pain, or a combination of these symptoms, with a small subset having symptomatic central nervous system involvement at diagnosis. In adults, 75% of ALL is of B-cell lineage; mature B-cell ALL can present as extramedullary disease, including gastrointestinal or testicular involvement. Although ALL can occur in younger adult patients, the association of acute leukemia with DIC most strongly supports the diagnosis of APL."

This patient does not have splenomegaly, and patients with PMF do not present with DIC."
