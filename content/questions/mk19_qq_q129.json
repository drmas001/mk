Stasis dermatitis is a complication of chronic venous insufficiency, which is recognized by the presence of dependent edema, varicose veins, and trophic skin changes such as hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, and ulcers. Stasis dermatitis is an inflammatory reaction that can be very pruritic and erythematous and may include vesiculation and weeping skin. Symptoms are often bilateral, although it may be unilaterally symptomatic. Treatment typically includes exercise (walking or heel lifts) and compression stockings to decrease venous hypertension and dependent edema."

Lichen simplex chronicus manifests as thickened plaques with erythema and hyperpigmentation. Exaggerated skin markings are seen on the surface of the skin as well. Common sites include the genitals, back of the neck, wrists, ankles, and lower legs. Lichen simplex chronicus does not present as an acute eczematous skin reaction with weeping associated with chronic venous insufficiency."
