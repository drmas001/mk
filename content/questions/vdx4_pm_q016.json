"The most likely diagnosis is obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is an increasingly common disorder defined by sleep interruption due to repetitive upper airway narrowing or collapse. Disordered breathing events are most prominent during rapid eye movement (REM), a stage of sleep characterized by atonia of nearly all muscles, with the exception of the extraocular muscles and respiratory diaphragm. Efforts to breathe persist against the airway occlusion, resulting in intrathoracic pressure swings. The process is terminated with a brief awakening from sleep (called a microarousal), during which upper airway patency is restored and ventilation resumes, typically followed by resumption of sleep and continual repetition of the process. The polysomnogram demonstrates the association of airflow obstruction with periods of oxygen desaturation. Note the diminished airflow despite continuing muscular activity of rib cage and abdomen indicating airflow obstruction; in central sleep apnea, this muscular activity of the rib cage and abdomen would not be seen."
