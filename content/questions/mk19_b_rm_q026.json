"). The patient's primary symptom is worsening oral dryness associated with Sjögren syndrome. There is no disease-modifying treatment to globally address manifestations of Sjögren syndrome, and no medication alters the natural history of chronic oral and ocular dryness. However, treatments can alleviate xerostomia and xerophthalmia. For oral dryness, behavioral management may be enough to allay symptoms. This can include chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugar-free sour candies or lozenges to stimulate saliva, taking frequent small sips of water, or using a spray bottle to moisten mucosal surfaces (to limit oral intake). Saliva substitutes are available commercially in the form of oral sprays, gels, and rinses for more severe symptoms but are often not effective. Cevimeline, a cholinergic muscarinic agonist, stimulates salivation and is appropriate for moderate oral dryness that does not improve with the aforementioned interventions. Pilocarpine, another muscarinic agonist, is an equally efficacious alternative to cevimeline. Cholinergic adverse effects of cevimeline and pilocarpine can include sweating, abdominal pain, nausea, flushing, and increased urination. Ocular dryness can be treated with over-the-counter remedies, such as artificial tears (used during the day) and eye lubricants (usually used before bedtime). Refractory or severe ocular dryness may be managed by using topical immunosuppressive-containing drops, such as cyclosporine (a calcineurin inhibitor) or lifitegrast (an integrin inhibitor)."

This medication was widely favored by Sjögren syndrome specialists until a randomized controlled trial published in 2014 demonstrated no efficacy for oral or ocular dryness or fatigue after 24 weeks compared with placebo. Hydroxychloroquine can, however, benefit patients with Sjögren syndrome who experience inflammatory arthritis or subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus."

It is recommended that glucocorticoids be used at the minimum dose and length of time necessary to control active systemic disease."
