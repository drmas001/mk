" conidia initially invade pulmonary blood vessels and cause distal infarction of tissue. Patients generally have fever, cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis at presentation; this is usually seen in immunosuppressed patients with neutropenia. Pulmonary infection involves infiltrates, thin-walled cavities, nodules, or wedge-shaped densities resembling infarcts that may be seen on chest radiographs or CT scans. In this person, the ground-glass appearance surrounding the nodule indicates hemorrhage into the surrounding lung tissue (halo sign). In the appropriate clinical setting, the halo sign may indicate the presence of aspergillosis or other angioinvasive fungal infection, including fusariosis and mucormycosis. Other sites of involvement include the central nervous system, skin, and eye. Profound and prolonged neutropenia, especially in association with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy, is a risk factor for invasive aspergillosis; solid organ transplant recipients are also at increased risk. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy are the most effective methods for definitive diagnosis. In patients with pulmonary disease, the BAL and serum galactomannan assay have excellent sensitivity and specificity (both >80%) in patients with hematologic malignancies or following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
