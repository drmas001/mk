"). Given this patient's significant smoking history and imaging findings of a pulmonary mass and associated lymphadenopathy, she has a high pretest probability of primary lung cancer. The most appropriate diagnostic test is one that not only confirms the diagnosis but also provides adequate staging to help plan treatment. Needle aspiration of the left supraclavicular lymph nodes is the least invasive procedure and would also stage the likely cancer by documenting metastatic disease to these lymph nodes. During evaluation of this patient, it is important not to miss a concomitant head and neck cancer; smoking is a common risk factor for both lung and head and neck cancer. If the patient has high cervical or contralateral cervical lymph nodes, they might need further evaluation to confirm or exclude a second head and neck primary cancer."

In addition, CT-guided needle biopsy would not provide information on staging because it would not assess whether there is involvement of the mediastinal or supraclavicular lymph nodes."

"PET scans can be very helpful in the initial evaluation of potential lung cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that PET identifies unsuspected mediastinal involvement, distant disease, or both, which informs staging biopsies and reduces futile (noncurative) surgery. This patient has clinically apparent metastatic disease involving the supraclavicular lymph nodes. Needle aspiration of the lymph nodes will likely provide evidence of metastatic disease, which will inform treatment options, obviating the need for a PET scan (",
