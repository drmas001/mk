"A 45-year-old man is evaluated following a recent diagnosis of a gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor. The tumor was discovered after an abdominal CT scan for acute alcohol-related pancreatitis. The CT scan revealed more than 12 hypodense lesions in the liver ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm (replacing approximately 5% to 10% of the liver volume) and a 2-cm mesenteric mass. Following recovery from the pancreatitis, a core needle biopsy of one of the liver lesions was obtained and revealed a well-differentiated, low-grade neuroendocrine tumor. The patient reports feeling well since discharge from the hospital. He is enrolled in a 12-step facilitation program for alcohol use disorder."

") and a repeat CT in 3 months. He is incidentally found to have an asymptomatic, well-differentiated, low-grade, small bowel gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor (previously known as carcinoid) with multiple small metastases to the liver. Such tumors are often present for many years before diagnosis and are often very indolent. Nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors are often discovered incidentally. The liver is the most common site of metastases. Asymptomatic patients may have minimal growth and no symptoms for many months or years, even with metastatic disease. Therefore, there is no urgency to intervene, and all interventions carry the potential for risk and expense. A 3-month follow-up examination with repeat imaging is appropriate in asymptomatic patients with relatively low-volume, asymptomatic disease. Approximately one-third to half of metastatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors will produce serotonin, a hormone that causes diarrhea and/or facial flushing; however, most patients have a hormonally nonfunctional tumor and will not require treatment for these symptoms. In patients who have stable disease at the 3-month scan, further monitoring with serial imaging at 3- to 6-month intervals is appropriate."
