IgA provides mucosal immunity; therefore, patients with IgA deficiency are susceptible to infections of the respiratory tract and, less frequently, gastrointestinal tract. Sinopulmonary infections are the most common presenting manifestation. Patients with IgA deficiency may also develop celiac disease with associated chronic diarrhea. Consideration of IgA deficiency is reasonable in this patient, but immunoglobulin testing is normal, excluding this disorder."
