") is the most likely diagnosis. Also known as benign familial hematuria, inheritance in this disease is autosomal dominant. The inherited type IV collagen abnormality causes thinning of the GBM, which results in hematuria but usually without proteinuria or abnormal kidney function. Thin GBM disease may affect up to 5% of the population, with up to 50% of patients who are diagnosed reporting a family history of hematuria without kidney failure. Both microscopic and macroscopic hematuria can be seen, first manifesting in young adulthood. Although diagnosis can be made by kidney biopsy, this is not usually required in the setting of a good clinical and family history. Genetic testing may also be used to make the diagnosis."
