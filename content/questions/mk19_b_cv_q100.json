"). This patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a normally functioning mechanical mitral valve. Patients with a mechanical cardiac valve require antithrombotic therapy for thromboembolic prophylaxis. Given the increased thrombogenicity associated with mechanical versus bioprosthetic cardiac valves, antithrombotic management requires anticoagulant therapy rather than antiplatelet monotherapy. With the advent of direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban), there has been interest in using these agents in patients with mechanical and bioprosthetic cardiac valves. However, given the data from the randomized RE-ALIGN trial, which showed that dabigatran was associated with excess bleeding and thromboembolic events compared with warfarin, dabigatran (",
{
"type":"tag",
"tagName":"b",
"attrs":{
},
"children":[

},
") should be avoided. The safety of other direct oral anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban (",
{
"type":"tag",
"tagName":"b",
"attrs":{
},
"children":[
"Option E"
]
},
"), has not been assessed, and these agents should not be used. Instead, warfarin and/or aspirin should be used, depending on valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical) and position (aortic, mitral, pulmonary, or tricuspid). With mechanical valves in the mitral position, guidelines recommend anticoagulation with warfarin, with a goal INR of 3.0. A range of 2.5 to 3.5 is acceptable to balance the risks of under- and over-anticoagulation in a patient with a mechanical mitral valve."

"Although this patient has ecchymoses, he has a normal hemoglobin level, no clinical evidence of overt bleeding, and a therapeutic INR. As a result, no change should be made to his warfarin dosing or his goal INR (",

"attrs":{

"). In practice, it is difficult to control the INR exactly, and in the absence of clinically significant overt bleeding, the risk for under-anticoagulation precludes a change in INR range for ecchymoses."

Adding aspirin (75-100 mg/d) to warfarin may be considered in patients who have an indication for antiplatelet therapy (cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease) if their bleeding risk is low. Aspirin (75-100 mg/d) monotherapy is also reasonable in patients with a bioprosthetic valve and no additional indication for anticoagulation."
