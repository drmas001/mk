"). In addition, this patient should receive basic life support measures with high-flow oxygen, cardiac monitoring, recumbent positioning, and establishment of intravenous (IV) access with IV fluid administration as needed. Concerns include airway obstruction, bronchospasm, and distributive shock. Of these, the patient has evidence only of bronchospasm at this time, but she should be monitored for the other manifestations of anaphylaxis. The initial treatment of anaphylaxis is IM epinephrine, repeated as needed every 5 to 15 minutes, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. Patients with wheezing unresponsive to IM epinephrine should also receive treatment with an inhaled Î²",

Patients with a history of anaphylactic reactions should carry an epinephrine autoinjector, wear an alert bracelet to let responders know of their hypersensitivity, and be referred to an immunologist/allergist for possible venom immunotherapy."
