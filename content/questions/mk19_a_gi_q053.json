"). This patient has experienced bleeding, a complication of NSAID-related peptic ulcer disease. Although more than 85% of cases of NSAID-related peptic ulcers heal after 6 to 8 weeks of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and avoidance of NSAIDs, reintroducing NSAIDs risks ulcer recurrence. Prevention of ulcer recurrence is therefore the most important long-term goal to reduce morbidity and mortality. If long-term NSAID use is necessary, potential treatment strategies include (1) an NSAID plus a gastroprotective agent, such as a PPI; (2) an NSAID and an H",

") or misoprostol; (3) a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)–selective NSAID in place of a nonselective NSAID; or (4) a COX-2–selective NSAID plus a gastroprotective agent. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 82 clinical trials totaling more than 125,000 participants found the combination of a COX-2–selective NSAID plus a PPI provided the best gastrointestinal protection from ulcer recurrence and ulcer complications. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, are available by prescription for arthritis and pose a lower risk for systemic adverse effects than oral NSAIDs. They may be preferred for patients at high risk for toxicity from oral NSAIDs and/or for patients age 75 years and older. However, topical NSAIDs are often expensive. The use of a topical NSAID in this patient would be impractical considering his widespread pain. This review also showed that a COX-2–selective NSAID alone, a nonselective NSAID plus a PPI, and a nonselective NSAID plus misoprostol were more effective than a nonselective NSAID alone at reducing risk for ulcers and ulcer complications but were not as effective as a COX-2–selective NSAID and a PPI."
