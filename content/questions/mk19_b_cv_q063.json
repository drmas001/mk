The mitral regurgitation is primary (degenerative), as indicated by the patient's midsystolic click and late mitral regurgitation (both seen in mitral valve prolapse) and the demonstration of anterior prolapse by echocardiography. Although the presence of symptoms resulting from severe mitral regurgitation (such as shortness of breath and volume overload) is an indication for intervention, class 1 indications for intervention in asymptomatic patients include a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 60% or less and/or an LV end-systolic dimension of 40 mm or greater.
