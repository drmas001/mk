") is the most appropriate next step in management of this elderly patient, who describes the classic constellation of symptoms of actinic purpura. Actinic purpura appears as purpuric macules or patches, most commonly on the forearms and anterior legs, after minor trauma, such as scratching. It is caused by blood vessel fragility and dermal atrophy from aging. With the passage of time, the macules fade to a brown or tan color before resolving completely. There is no therapy for the purpura, but sun protection is recommended to prevent further damage. No additional testing or treatment is required, and the patient should be reassured."
