"). Ascites in a patient with liver disease is most likely to be due to cirrhosis. Portal hypertensive ascites is defined as a serum–ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) greater than or equal to 1.1 (calculated as serum albumin – ascites albumin). The differential diagnosis for high-SAAG ascites includes cirrhosis and noncirrhotic causes (e.g., heart failure). The total protein level can help differentiate cirrhotic ascites from cardiac ascites: The total protein level is low in cirrhotic ascites (<2.5 g/dL [25 g/L]) and high in cardiac ascites (≥2.5 g/dL [25 g/L]). This patient has elevated jugular venous pressure, a high SAAG, and high ascitic level of protein, suggesting a cardiac cause of ascites. Therefore, echocardiography should be performed."
