"). This patient is younger than 50 years and is at average risk for breast cancer. Women at average risk include those without family history of breast cancer or prior irradiation therapy to the chest region. Guidelines from multiple specialty societies and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) unanimously encourage annual or biennial screening mammography in women beginning at age 50 years. Although screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years may reduce the risk for breast cancer death, the number of deaths averted is smaller than that in older women and the number of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies is larger. In addition to false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies, all women undergoing regular screening mammography are at risk for the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to their health, or even apparent, during their lifetime (overdiagnosis). Beginning mammography screening at a younger age and screening more frequently may increase the risk for overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment. For patients younger than 50 years who are interested in screening, shared decision making is a reasonable strategy. Shared decision making includes consideration of the patient's level of risk, values, and preferences that will help inform the screening decision."
