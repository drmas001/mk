"). Gallstones are asymptomatic in most patients. Symptomatic gallstone disease manifests as colicky pain resulting from stimulation of the gallbladder in the presence of an obstructive cystic duct from gallstones or sludge. This pain is typically of relatively acute onset, is fairly severe and steady, and is located in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. Pain may radiate to the right scapula and can be associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, lasting 30 minutes to 6 hours. This symptom complex may be precipitated by eating a fatty meal, which causes gallbladder contraction. Patients with unrelenting right-upper-quadrant or epigastric pain, bothersome early satiety, or postprandial fullness generally do not have biliary colic. Asymptomatic gallstones are commonly discovered when patients undergo abdominal imaging (CT or ultrasonography) for unrelated reasons. Incidental gallstones do not typically cause symptoms, and prophylactic cholecystectomy is generally not recommended."
