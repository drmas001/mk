"). This patient has knee osteoarthritis (OA). A comprehensive plan for the management of OA includes educational, behavioral, psychosocial, and physical interventions, as well as pharmacologic therapy. In some patients, physical, psychosocial, mind-body interventions may be adequate to control symptoms; others may need sequential or combination approaches. For a motivated patient like this one, mind-body interventions, such as tai chi, are appropriate to consider as an adjunct option. Tai chi is a traditional Chinese mind-body practice that combines meditation with slow, gentle, graceful movements; deep diaphragmatic breathing; and relaxation. Tai chi has been shown in a randomized trial to be as beneficial as physical therapy for knee and hip OA pain and is strongly recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Arthritis Foundation (AF) guideline for the management of knee and/or hip osteoarthritis."
