"). The patient has painless jaundice with imaging features suggestive of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). CT findings that strongly suggest type 1 AIP include a diffusely enlarged pancreas with indistinct borders and delayed contrast enhancement. In comparison, imaging characteristics of pancreatic cancer include a low-density mass and dilatation and/or compression of the pancreatic duct associated with distal pancreatic atrophy. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration, if pursued, shows greater than 10 IgG4-positive cells/hpf; this finding is consistent with a diagnosis of type 1 AIP, a manifestation of IgG4 disease. A significant elevation of serum IgG4 level is also helpful in diagnosing type 1 AIP. Most IgG4-related conditions are characterized by plasma cell infiltration of the tissues and subsequent clinical manifestations. AIP is a frequent manifestation of IgG4-related disease, but nearly any organ may be involved, including lymph nodes, salivary glands, and the biliary system. Retroperitoneal fibrosis may also be related to IgG4 disease. Initial treatment includes high-dose prednisone tapered over 2 to 3 months. Symptoms typically resolve within 2 to 4 weeks of therapy. Approximately 90% of patients achieve remission with oral glucocorticoids. Failure of clinical symptoms to respond to glucocorticoids suggests an incorrect diagnosis, and other causes should be investigated. Up to 60% of patients may relapse. Readministration of glucocorticoids or immunomodulators, such as 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, mycophenolate, or rituximab, may be used to treat recurrent AIP. Diagnostic criteria for AIP are known by the acronym HISORt (diagnostic Histology, suggestive Imaging, Serology with elevated serum IgG4, Other organ involvement, or Response to therapy with glucocorticoids). Type 2 AIP, or idiopathic duct-centric pancreatitis, does not demonstrate IgG4-positive cells but is instead characterized by granulocytic lesions. Type 2 AIP may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease."

This patient most likely has primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a diagnosis that is best established by imaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to exclude extrahepatic obstruction and by positive results for AMA. PBC is an autoimmune disease affecting the small and medium bile ducts. It is often asymptomatic but can present with pruritus and fatigue. PBC is more common in women than men (female-to-male ratio is 9:1). Typically, the alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in PBC; if it is at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, a positive result on an AMA test establishes the diagnosis without the need for liver biopsy. Patients with PBC who are negative for AMA may test positive for other PBC-specific autoantibodies, including sp100 and gp210. Once PBC is diagnosed, first-line treatment is ursodeoxycholic acid, which results in histologic improvement, improves survival rates, and diminishes the need for liver transplantation."

"). The development of ascites is often the first manifestation of decompensation of cirrhosis. Ascites results from portal hypertension and functional renal impairment, which leads to ineffective natriuresis and retention of sodium. In patients with ascites due to cirrhosis, the initial management of ascites consists of dietary sodium restriction, which may equalize the sodium balance in patients and prevent ascites. If this treatment does not resolve the sodium imbalance, a diuretic regimen with spironolactone and furosemide can be prescribed to increase natriuresis. Medications that decrease renal perfusion pressures, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, can worsen ascites in patients with portal hypertension. Prostaglandin inhibitors, such as NSAIDs, can reduce urinary sodium excretion in patients with cirrhosis and can induce azotemia. Consequently, the 2021 guideline from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that NSAIDs; ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril; and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Based on available data, nonselective β-blockers are not necessarily contraindicated in patients with refractory ascites. However, caution is recommended in patients with hypotension, hyponatremia, or acute kidney injury."

Screening for chronic HBV infection is indicated in persons born or raised in regions with high rates of HBV infection, including Asia, Africa, the South Pacific, European Mediterranean countries, Eastern Europe, most of South America, Honduras, Guatemala, and the Middle East (except Israel and Cyprus). Screening will detect those who may benefit from treatment. Treatment is offered to selected patients in the immune active phase of infection. The four phases of infection are categorized on the basis of immune response to the virus: immune tolerant, immune active, immune control, and reactivation. The immune control phase of chronic HBV infection is also known as inactive chronic HBV infection. The immune control phase is characterized by normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) measurement, indicating absence of liver inflammation; positive results for hepatitis B core (HBc) antigen IgG antibody, indicating previous infection; hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)–negative and anti-HBe–positive serology, indicating lack of viral replication and infectivity; and HBV DNA level less than 2000 U/mL, indicating immune control of viral replication and infection. This patient meets all the criteria for the immune control phase of chronic HBV infection. She does not require treatment."

Diverticulitis results from a diverticulum (herniation of the mucosa and submucosa through a weakness in the muscle wall) becoming blocked, trapping bacteria, and subsequently developing inflammation. This immunosuppressed patient has acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (no abscess, obstruction, or fistula). The medical management of diverticulitis is based on the degree of the patient's symptoms and severity of disease. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is treated with oral antibiotics and a liquid diet. Intravenous antibiotics with activities against gram-negative rods and anaerobic organisms are required in patients who cannot tolerate an oral diet; patients with severe comorbidities, advanced age, or immunosuppression; and patients for whom oral antibiotics have been ineffective. Typical regimens include cefepime plus metronidazole, single-agent therapy with a β-lactam or β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination, or meropenem. This patient, who is immunosuppressed because of her prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy, should be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotics."

This patient's colonoscopy revealed a single 7-mm sessile serrated polyp. It is critical that a polyp be completely removed during colonoscopy. Research suggests that up to 27% of interval colon cancers occur in the same colon section as the previous polypectomy, and another analysis that reexamined the colon of patients with sessile polyps greater than 2 cm demonstrated that 17.6% had residual neoplastic tissue, suggesting that incomplete polyp removal may be a cause for interval cancers.

Available IgG serologies are antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptide or tissue transglutaminase. If the anti–deamidated gliadin peptide IgG antibody level is elevated, upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy should be performed; the presence of villus atrophy indicates a diagnosis of celiac disease, for which a gluten-free diet should be prescribed."

Thrombosis of the hepatic veins leads to hepatic congestion and increased portal pressures, resulting in ascites. Risk factors for Budd-Chiari syndrome include hypercoagulable states, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, pregnancy, and the use of oral contraceptives. Budd-Chiari syndrome can be diagnosed with Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen, which demonstrates absence of flow in the hepatic veins as well as hepatic congestion. Typically, the caudate lobe of the liver will develop hypertrophy because the venous drainage of this segment of the liver is directly into the inferior vena cava rather than through the hepatic veins. Long-term anticoagulation is required in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome, although bleeding risks are significant in patients with acute or chronic liver disease, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices. Angioplasty of the hepatic veins and/or placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can be used to reestablish adequate hepatic venous drainage. If liver failure develops, liver transplantation may be considered."

HAV incidence declined dramatically after introduction of universal childhood HAV vaccination, but rates have recently increased among unvaccinated people, especially those reporting homelessness or drug use. This unvaccinated patient has been exposed to a roommate with acute HAV infection and so is at risk for infection. Persons who have recently been exposed to HAV and have not been immunized should receive postexposure prophylaxis, consisting of the HAV vaccine, as soon as possible after exposure, preferably within 2 weeks. The HAV vaccine is recommended for prophylaxis in persons aged 12 months or older.

"). Although most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are sporadic, some are associated with hereditary endocrinopathies, such MEN1, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis. Among these inherited endocrinopathies, MEN1 is most frequently associated with pancreatic NETs (≥80%), whereas pancreatic NETs occur in 1% to 20% of the other inherited endocrinopathies. MEN1 is a rare heritable disorder classically characterized by a predisposition to tumors of the parathyroid glands, anterior pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells, including insulinoma, as seen in this patient. MEN1 is clinically diagnosed by the presence of two or more primary MEN1 tumor types. In patients who have family members with a diagnosis of MEN1, the presence of a single MEN1-associated tumor satisfies the diagnostic criteria for MEN1. Pancreatic NETs account for the greatest proportion of deaths in patients with MEN1, and gastrinoma is the most common of the functioning NETs. However, most gastrinomas are located in the duodenal wall, not the pancreas. Insulinomas are the second most common NET and the most common pancreatic NET; they tend to be small and may be multiple. Sporadic insulinomas occur in patients age 40 years and older; therefore, the diagnosis of insulinoma in a younger patient is cause to screen for MEN1."

"). Constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms, affecting 20% of the general population. Constipation can present with symptoms including infrequent, difficult, or incomplete defecation, and it can be acute or chronic. The patient's history is compatible with chronic constipation. Constipation can be secondary or functional (idiopathic). Medications are the most common cause of secondary constipation. Other causes of this common condition include mechanical obstruction, systemic illnesses, altered physiologic states, and psychosocial conditions. Once secondary causes have been excluded, chronic constipation is considered functional. Functional constipation is subtyped into categories of slow transit, normal transit, or dyssynergic defecation. Slow-transit constipation is defined as the delayed passage of fecal contents through the colon based on objective transit testing. Normal-transit constipation is functional constipation in which colonic transit times are adequate. Dyssynergic defecation refers to difficulty with or inability to expel stool as a result of some combination of abnormalities in contraction and/or relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor during defecation. Colonoscopy is the initial evaluation of constipation in elderly patients with acute constipation and patients with unintentional weight loss, family history of colorectal cancer, unexplained anemia, and age older than 45 years with no previous colonoscopy. This patient is age 52 years, and colonoscopy should be performed as the initial study to evaluate for mechanical causes of constipation."

"). The clinical presentation of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) varies. Many patients are asymptomatic, whereas others are diagnosed after an evaluation of abnormal laboratory test results demonstrating a cholestatic pattern of liver injury. Symptomatic patients present with fatigue and pruritus. Clinical findings vary as well. Asymptomatic patients may have no findings, and others may have jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and excoriations related to pruritus. PSC is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in approximately 85% of cases. Therefore, all patients with PSC without known IBD should have colonoscopy with biopsies at the time of PSC diagnosis. Common colonoscopy findings in patients with PSC and IBD include mild pancolitis with rectal sparing and backwash ileitis. Because of the higher risk for colon cancer in these patients, surveillance colonoscopy with biopsies is also recommended every 1 to 2 years. Patients with PSC have a 15% lifetime risk for cholangiocarcinoma. Annual or biannual magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and measurement of the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level are recommended for cholangiocarcinoma surveillance. The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is highest in the first 2 years after PSC is diagnosed. There is also an increased risk for gallbladder cancer in PSC, and regular annual screening with ultrasonography is recommended."

She received intravenous resuscitation overnight, which typically consists of 250 to 500 mL/h of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution, with fluid boluses as needed for severe volume depletion. Treatment with intravenous fluids should be aimed at avoiding hypovolemia and maintaining adequate organ perfusion. Goal-directed therapy allows for titration of fluids to particular biochemical and clinical targets, including blood pressure, pulse rate, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, and hematocrit. This patient initially had risk factors for severe disease, including a hematocrit greater than 44%, which has improved with volume resuscitation. Overall, her pain is improving and oral feeding should therefore be considered. Patients with acute pancreatitis should resume feeding when pain improves and any nausea or vomiting subsides.

Endoscopy to assess for Barrett esophagus is indicated. The diagnosis of Barrett esophagus is confirmed by the finding of salmon-colored mucosa on endoscopy with columnar epithelium with acid-mucin–containing goblet cells on histopathology. Barrett esophagus progresses as follows: intestinal metaplasia, indefinite for dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, intramucosal carcinoma, and, finally, invasive adenocarcinoma. Patients with high-grade dysplasia and confirmed low-grade dysplasia should undergo treatment to eradicate all neoplastic and at-risk epithelium. Patients with Barrett esophagus without dysplasia should undergo surveillance endoscopy every 3 to 5 years to monitor for dysplasia or precancerous changes."

"). Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic, inflammatory liver disease that has variable presentation, from asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferase levels to extrahepatic symptoms (e.g., myalgia and malaise) to acute liver failure. Diagnosis is based on laboratory test results, including the presence of antinuclear and smooth-muscle antibodies and elevated IgG levels, exclusion of other diagnoses (e.g., Wilson disease, viral hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury), and liver biopsy. Patients with severe presentations require management by a hepatologist. The mainstay of treatment is immunosuppression. Induction of remission is typically with prednisone or a combination of prednisone and azathioprine. Depending on response, maintenance therapy may consist of prednisone or azathioprine monotherapy or combination therapy. Because of the high rate of relapse, therapy is recommended for at least 2 to 3 years. Biochemical response may occur within 3 to 8 months of treatment in 85% of patients whose disease responds to standard treatment, but histologic response can lag by several months. Therefore, a liver biopsy is recommended to demonstrate absence of active inflammation before cessation of therapy."

Abdominal CT is indicated to assess the severity, phase, and distribution of colonic ischemia. CT findings are nonspecific, including segmental bowel wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding, often in the distribution of the “watershed” areas of the colon (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction).

Typically, octreotide is administered to reduce portal pressures, and antibiotics are provided to reduce risk for infectious complications of gastrointestinal bleeding. These complications include bacteremia, which can increase morbidity and mortality from variceal bleeding. Treatment options for gastric varices along the greater curvature of the stomach depend on the anatomy of the abdominal vasculature. For isolated gastric varices due to splenic vein thrombosis, splenectomy can be performed to decompress varices. If the portal vein is patent and a suitable splenorenal shunt is available, balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration of varices can be considered. If the anatomy of the hepatic veins and portal vein branches is favorable, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may be an option. To determine the best therapy, contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging is required. Therefore, abdominal CT with contrast is the best next action."

Other intestinal manifestations of FAP include benign fundic gland polyps of the stomach, duodenal adenomas, and ampullary adenomas. Extracolonic manifestations include desmoid tumors, papillary thyroid cancer, extra teeth, cysts, osteomas, and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium. De novo mutations are found in up to 25% of FAP cases. The patient should undergo genetic counseling and germline genetic testing, which would confirm a diagnosis of FAP. Her unaffected parents should also undergo genetic testing to confirm that this finding is a de novo mutation.

The surgical approach depends on the rectal polyp burden. In this patient, the rectum is relatively spared, and the patient may be a candidate for a subtotal colectomy with sparing of the rectum. Following colectomy, she should have annual sigmoidoscopy, as well as surveillance of her upper gastrointestinal tract and thyroid."

The left liver is smaller than the right liver; therefore, in this patient, resection of cancer that spares the right liver should be undertaken. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is important in patients with cirrhosis, even those who have undergone successful antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus infection. Although successful antiviral therapy decreases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, the risk is not eliminated and screening with abdominal ultrasonography should be performed indefinitely at 6-month intervals. Patients who undergo surgical resection are at risk for recurrent hepatocellular cancer, and surveillance imaging should continue after resection."

In women aged 30 to 65 years who want to extend the screening interval, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (preferred) or cytology combined with high-risk HPV testing can be performed every 5 years. However, women with IBD have increased risk for cervical dysplasia; this risk is greater in women using immunosuppressive therapy. Women with IBD receiving immunosuppressive therapy should undergo Pap testing annually. Patients with IBD also have increased risk for vaccine-preventable illnesses. Inactivated vaccines can be safely administered to all patients with IBD, regardless of immunosuppression. Depression and anxiety are more common in patients with IBD than in the general population, and screening is recommended. Patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease should undergo yearly melanoma screening, and those receiving immunomodulators should be screened for nonmelanoma squamous cell cancer while using these agents."

Virologic cure is associated with reduced risk for progression to cirrhosis, cirrhosis complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality.

AMI most commonly presents with abrupt onset of severe periumbilical abdominal pain followed by the urge to defecate. Although the patient reports severe abdominal pain, physical examination reveals a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen without peritoneal signs. Pain that is disproportionate to physical examination findings should immediately raise suspicion for early AMI. With late presentation, intestinal ischemia progresses to infarction and peritoneal signs develop. This late presentation of AMI is associated with a high mortality rate. Results of laboratory studies and abdominal imaging in early AMI are nonspecific. Most patients will have an elevated leukocyte count. Serum lactate level may be normal and does not exclude the diagnosis. CT angiography is the recommended imaging modality to diagnose AMI."

Patients with low fibrosis scores are classified as low risk and are managed with weight loss and lifestyle modifications. Patients with indeterminate fibrosis scores should undergo liver stiffness measurement with transient elastography; patients with low liver stiffness are managed as low risk, whereas patients with indeterminate or high-risk stiffness should be managed by a hepatologist. Patients with a high NAFLD fibrosis score or FIB-4 score should be referred to hepatology for consideration of liver stiffness measurement or liver biopsy. The mainstay of NAFLD management for all patients is weight loss. Weight loss of at least 5% improves steatosis, whereas weight loss of 8% to 10% improves steatohepatitis and fibrosis. No specific diet for NAFLD is recommended. Bariatric surgery and concomitant weight loss improve inflammation and fibrosis associated with NAFLD."

The HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome is a serious manifestation of preeclampsia and must be recognized promptly. HELLP typically presents with nonspecific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea with vomiting, pruritus, and jaundice. The only definitive therapy is delivery of the fetus. Prompt treatment is paramount because rates of fetal and maternal mortality are high. Treatment with first-line agents for severe hypertension should occur as soon as possible to reduce the risk for maternal stroke. The goal is to rapidly achieve a blood pressure in the range of 140 to 150/90 to 100 mm Hg. Coagulopathy may increase the risk for bleeding in the perinatal state. Liver dysfunction can worsen in the 48 hours after delivery before resolving. Rarely, liver transplantation may be required if symptoms of liver failure progress."

The lack of nocturnal symptoms and improvement of symptoms with fasting suggest osmotic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrhea results from a nonabsorbed, osmotically active substance in the intestinal lumen, leading to luminal fluid accumulation due to an osmotic gradient. This gradient is present after ingestion of an osmotically active substance and is absent during fasting (including during sleep). A common cause of osmotic diarrhea is lactase deficiency that results in lactose malabsorption, which typically presents in young adulthood. In this condition, brush-border lactase is lost and ingested lactose is no longer broken down to its constituent monosaccharides. The persistent presence of this unabsorbed disaccharide creates an osmotic gradient. Although a lactose breath test is available to test for lactase deficiency, the diagnosis can typically be based on improvement after exclusion of dietary lactose or administration of lactase enzymes with meals."

These factors contribute to accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal space. Initial management of ascites includes dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy with spironolactone and furosemide. As the splanchnic vasculature progressively dilates and renal perfusion decreases with worsening of portal hypertension, hepatorenal syndrome can develop, which manifests as declining renal function. The initial evaluation of these patients is investigation for a decrease in intravascular volume and for infection and exclusion of other causes of acute kidney injury. In this patient, furosemide and spironolactone may be exacerbating renal hypoperfusion and should be stopped. Assessment for oliguria, urinalysis (bland urinary sediment), and urine sodium concentration (low) is also appropriate in the evaluation for suspected hepatorenal syndrome."

Classification allows narrowing the differential diagnosis to guide selective laboratory testing and imaging. Stool electrolytes measured in liquid stool can help identify osmotic diarrhea, as indicated by a fecal osmotic gap, which suggests an unmeasured osmotically active intraluminal substance. The fecal osmotic gap can be calculated as follows: 290 – (2 × [stool sodium + stool potassium]). In this patient, the fecal osmotic gap is: 290 – (2 × [85 + 4.5]) = 111 mOsm/kg. An osmotic gap of greater than 100 mOsm/kg suggests an unmeasured osmotically active substance. Such substances include malabsorbed carbohydrates (e.g., lactose or fructose) and sorbitol. The latter is an artificial sweetener commonly found in sugar-free gum. Treatment of osmotic diarrhea requires avoiding offending agents, such as following a low–fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) and a lactose-free diet."

Additional symptoms include heartburn, weight loss, and chest pain unresponsive to acid-reducing agents. It can be idiopathic or associated with viral, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders and infection (e.g., Chagas disease). The initial diagnostic test is barium esophagography or upper endoscopy, which shows dilation of the esophagus with narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction. In classic achalasia, esophageal manometry shows incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and aperistalsis; however, not all patients with conditions on the spectrum of achalasia-type disorders have these classic findings. Upper endoscopy reveals retained food and saliva, no signs of mechanical obstruction, and “tightness” at the gastroesophageal junction while the scope is advanced into the stomach. Treatment of achalasia aims to decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure, which relieves symptoms. Treatments include botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic balloon dilation, peroral endoscopic myotomy, or laparoscopic myotomy. Choice of therapy depends on patient factors, type of disease, and available local expertise."

"). This patient most likely has dumping syndrome as a consequence of her sleeve gastrectomy. Dumping syndrome can follow a variety of surgical procedures, including vagotomy, pyloroplasty, Roux-en-Y bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and esophagectomy. Early dumping syndrome, as in this patient, results from the rapid transition of food into the small intestine, causing a fluid shift and potential release of gastrointestinal hormones with vasoactive properties. Classic gastrointestinal symptoms can include abdominal pain, epigastric fullness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, borborygmi, and bloating. Classic vasomotor symptoms can include palpitations and tachycardia, faintness or syncope, diaphoresis, and flushing and pallor. Symptoms typically occur within 1 hour of eating. Treatment should be tiered, beginning with dietary modifications and patient education by a trained dietitian. Dietary interventions can include the pursuit of smaller and more frequent meals (at least six per day); delayed intake of fluids by at least 30 minutes after intake of solids; avoidance of rapidly absorbable carbohydrates and alcohol; increased intake of high-fiber, high-protein foods; and lying down after a meal for 30 minutes. The use of dietary supplements, such as guar gum or pectin, to increase food viscosity can also be helpful."

Most hepatic adenomas are found in women (and are eight times more common than in men), particularly those using oral contraceptive agents.

In patients with Mallory-Weiss tear, PPI therapy to prevent recurrent bleeding is less well studied but is not commonly used. This patient does not have a guideline-recommended indication for continued PPI use, and it would be appropriate to discontinue the omeprazole.

In this patient, the marked anorectal pain with attempted inspection of the perianal area in the context of painful defecatory bleeding is nearly diagnostic of anal fissure. A digital rectal examination is not needed in patients with severe anal pain, particularly when a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is excluded (as in this patient), because the likely diagnosis is an anal fissure. Acute anal fissures generally resolve within a few weeks with the use of sitz baths, psyllium, bulking agents, and topical vasodilators (nifedipine and nitroglycerin). Topical anesthetics and anti-inflammatory agents can be considered to address pain or bleeding, but their use is not required to promote fissure healing."

Categories of the extent of ulcerative colitis include proctitis (within 18 cm of the anal verge, distal to the rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis (extending from the sigmoid to the splenic flexure), and extensive colitis (beyond the splenic flexure). This patient's symptoms, colonoscopy findings, and histopathologic features are diagnostic of mild, left-sided ulcerative colitis. The initial therapy of choice would be 5-ASA enemas because they deliver active drug to the rectum and sigmoid colon. 5-ASAs are anti-inflammatory medications and the mainstay of treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, with a dose-dependent response when used to induce disease remission. Of note, combined 5-ASA therapy (oral and topical) is superior for induction of remission compared with oral or topical therapies alone.

The most common initial presentation of esophageal carcinoma is dysphagia with solid foods; other symptoms include weight loss, anorexia, anemia caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, and chest pain. The two types of esophageal carcinoma are squamous cell carcinoma (most commonly located in the proximal esophagus) and adenocarcinoma (usually found in the distal esophagus). Risk factors for adenocarcinoma include male sex, older age, GERD, Barrett esophagus, obesity, and tobacco use. Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include tobacco and alcohol use, caustic injury, achalasia, past thoracic radiation, nutritional deficiencies (zinc, selenium), and poor socioeconomic status."

Hepatic sarcoidosis is an idiopathic condition that results in non-necrotizing granulomas. The organ most commonly affected by sarcoidosis is the lung, although the liver is also often affected. Most patients with hepatic sarcoidosis are asymptomatic; if symptoms do exist, they are typically mild and may consist of pruritus or abdominal pain due to hepatic capsule stretch. It is unclear whether immunosuppressive therapy affects the clinical course of hepatic sarcoidosis, and treatment is usually not initiated unless symptoms are severe or markers of liver inflammation are significantly abnormal. Conditions such as tuberculosis, fungal infections, brucellosis, Q fever, Hodgkin lymphoma, and drug toxicity can also cause granulomatous lesions in the liver, and steps should be undertaken to exclude these conditions before a diagnosis of sarcoidosis is accepted. The presence of skin or chest imaging findings typical of sarcoidosis also supports the diagnosis of hepatic sarcoidosis. Hepatic sarcoidosis rarely results in liver failure, but portal hypertension is common. Therefore, upper endoscopy to evaluate for esophageal varices is warranted, particularly in this patient with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia."

Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, are available by prescription for arthritis and pose a lower risk for systemic adverse effects than oral NSAIDs. They may be preferred for patients at high risk for toxicity from oral NSAIDs and/or for patients age 75 years and older. However, topical NSAIDs are often expensive. The use of a topical NSAID in this patient would be impractical considering his widespread pain. This review also showed that a COX-2–selective NSAID alone, a nonselective NSAID plus a PPI, and a nonselective NSAID plus misoprostol were more effective than a nonselective NSAID alone at reducing risk for ulcers and ulcer complications but were not as effective as a COX-2–selective NSAID and a PPI."

Elevations in alkaline phosphatase and serum total bilirubin levels and proportionally lesser elevations of aminotransferase levels indicate cholestatic hepatitis, the most common cause of which is drug-induced cholestasis. Drug-induced liver injury can result from exposure to prescription and nonprescription drugs as well as herbal and dietary supplements, even if the exposure occurred 6 months before symptom onset. The likely source of this patient's cholestasis is the amoxicillin-clavulanate she received for diverticulitis. Antibiotics (particularly amoxicillin-clavulanate) and antiepileptic medications (phenytoin and valproate) are among the most common medications associated with drug-induced liver injury, representing 60% of cases. Liver injury typically resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug; resolution of liver injury supports the diagnosis. Jaundice that occurs with cholestatic drug reactions can take months to resolve. Treatment of drug-induced liver disease is largely supportive, with removal of the offending agent. Liver transplantation can be considered in patients who have evidence of liver failure (i.e., those for whom liver injury is associated with encephalopathy and coagulopathy)."

"), also called transfer dysphagia. Swallowing has three phases: oral phase (food bolus forms and transfers to the back of the throat), pharyngeal phase (bolus is safely positioned in the upper throat, the soft palate elevates, the epiglottis protects the trachea, the tongue moves backward, and the pharyngeal wall moves forward), and esophageal phase (bolus enters the esophagus with relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter). When the first two phases fail to position a bolus in the throat for entry into the esophagus, choking, coughing, and nasal regurgitation of solids and liquids may occur. These symptoms pose a risk for aspiration pneumonia. Other presenting symptoms may include hoarseness (resulting from laryngeal nerve damage) and dysarthria (from weakness of the soft palate or pharyngeal constrictors), both suggesting an underlying neurologic disorder. Indeed, oropharyngeal dysphagia may be an early symptom or presenting sign of neurologic disorders, such as Parkinson disease and stroke. It is important to recognize oropharyngeal dysphagia by history because the initial recommended study is a modified barium swallow (with a range of liquid and solid consistencies) and videofluoroscopy. Endoscopy and esophageal manometry have a limited role in the evaluation of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Management consists of dietary changes and a swallowing exercise program."

The evaluation of chronic diarrhea starts with a history and physical examination, followed by selective diagnostic testing that includes laboratory analyses and imaging, depending on the differential diagnosis. Many drugs can cause diarrhea, and it can be difficult to identify a drug-related cause of diarrhea in patients taking multiple medications. The temporal relationship between starting a drug and diarrhea onset can be helpful when present but is not always obvious. A reasonable strategy is to discontinue a potential culprit drug, if possible, and assess the effect on the patient's symptoms. This patient's history is notable for regular use of ibuprofen, an NSAID implicated in chronic diarrhea. The mechanism by which ibuprofen causes diarrhea is uncertain, but this effect sometimes occurs in the context of microscopic colitis. Discontinuing ibuprofen may lead to resolution of his symptoms, obviating the need for further evaluation."

"). The type of lesion responsible for small bowel bleeding depends on patient age but not sex or ethnicity. Patients younger than 40 years are likely to have small-bowel bleeding due to inflammatory bowel disease, Dieulafoy lesions, neoplasia, Meckel diverticulum, or a polyposis syndrome. Patients older than 40 years are likely to have bleeding due to angiodysplasia, Dieulafoy lesions, neoplasia, or NSAID-related ulcers. If a bleeding source is not identified on initial endoscopy and colonoscopy, second-look upper endoscopy or colonoscopy should be performed if the initial studies were of low quality. Push enteroscopy may be pursued in lieu of endoscopy to visualize the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. Repeat colonoscopy should include intubation of the terminal ileum. This patient is suspected of having small-bowel bleeding as the source of his iron deficiency anemia, given the lack of a source on high-quality upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. This bleeding can be further characterized as occult given the absence of overt signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, including melena and hematochezia. Video capsule endoscopy noninvasively evaluates the entire small bowel. This test uses a nondigestible wireless capsule camera that is swallowed or placed endoscopically. Capsule endoscopy allows noninvasive evaluation of the entire small bowel in 79% to 90% of patients, with a diagnostic yield of 38% to 83% in patients suspected of having small-bowel bleeding. The American College of Gastroenterology has recommended it as a first-line procedure for further evaluation of the small bowel after upper and lower gastrointestinal sources of occult gastrointestinal bleeding have been excluded. Alternatively, in uncomplicated asymptomatic patients with iron deficiency anemia and negative bidirectional endoscopy, a trial of initial iron supplementation over the routine use of video capsule endoscopy is conditionally suggested by the American Gastroenterological Association."

"). Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is an uncommon condition most often resulting from atherosclerotic narrowing of the mesenteric arteries. The classic symptom triad of CMI is postprandial abdominal pain, sitophobia (fear of eating), and weight loss, but this set of symptoms is seen in only 30% of patients with CMI. In the setting of recurrent postprandial abdominal pain, CMI should be suspected. Pain begins approximately 30 minutes after food ingestion as the fixed narrowing of the mesenteric arteries prevents blood flow from increasing and meeting the increased functional demand of the small bowel, with resultant ischemia. The diagnosis of CMI requires exclusion of alternative causes of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss, along with compatible imaging findings. CT or magnetic resonance angiography findings suggesting CMI include severe stenosis (>70%) of two of the three mesenteric arteries. If the patient has compatible symptoms and suggestive angiographic findings, and alternative explanations for postprandial abdominal pain have been excluded, then the diagnosis of CMI is secure. In patients with symptoms suggestive of CMI, CT mesenteric angiography is the recommended initial diagnostic imaging test because it allows for rapid and accurate assessment of the mesenteric vasculature. Duplex ultrasonography of the mesenteric vessels is a reasonable screening modality to detect high-grade stenosis of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries for patients being evaluated in an outpatient setting."

CTA is the initial diagnostic test in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or have rapid ongoing bleeding, followed by immediate upper endoscopy if CTA does not reveal a source of bleeding. Because this patient is hemodynamically stable and does not have active bleeding, CTA would not be appropriate. Although tagged red cell scintigraphy can detect bleeding rates as low as 0.1 mL/min, its usefulness in acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding is debated. Sensitivity of nuclear studies for the detection of a lower gastrointestinal bleeding site varies from 60% to 93%. Although nuclear studies may be able to detect lower gastrointestinal bleeding, precise anatomic location is inferior to that provided by first-line diagnostic tests. Tagged red cell scintigraphy may be considered when results of first-line tests, such as CTA, angiography, or colonoscopy, are negative."

Causes of fat malabsorption include pancreatic dysfunction, infections (e.g., giardiasis and Whipple disease), celiac disease, tropical sprue, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO is caused by various conditions, including impaired motility, strictures (e.g., in Crohn disease), or blind loops (e.g., small-bowel diverticula). The patient's jejunal diverticulum is a blind loop and a key risk factor for SIBO. The pathogenesis of steatorrhea in SIBO is thought to be due to the deconjugation of bile salts by excessive intraluminal bacteria, interfering with formation of micelles that are necessary for fat absorption. SIBO can be diagnosed in the appropriate clinical context with both typical symptoms (abdominal discomfort, flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea) and a confirmatory test, such as a glucose breath test, in which exhaled hydrogen and methane (byproducts of bacterial metabolism of ingested glucose) are measured after glucose administration. Glucose breath tests are approximately 80% sensitive but only 40% specific for diagnosing SIBO. Empiric antibiotic therapy with monitoring for improvement in symptoms may be reasonable in patients with a high probability of SIBO."

Pancreatic cysts are being detected more frequently because of increased use of imaging and improved imaging techniques; these cysts may be found in 15% of individuals undergoing abdominal imaging. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are subcategorized as mucin-producing and non–mucin-producing cysts. Mucin-producing cysts, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms, are thought to have malignant potential, but many never become malignant. Non–mucin-producing cysts, such as a serous cystadenoma, have no malignant potential and can often be identified by their characteristic imaging features. These cysts require no further evaluation unless symptomatic."

Surgical resection is recommended for nearly all mucinous neoplasms and main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms if the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate. Mucinous cystic neoplasms occur almost exclusively in women in their fifth to seventh decades of life and are almost always located in the body or tail of the pancreas. These neoplasms have moderate malignant potential. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are equally prevalent in men and women, usually appearing in their fifth to seventh decades of life. Branch-duct IPMNs are characterized by cystic structures that may appear throughout the pancreas. Imaging characteristics of main duct IPMNs include main pancreatic duct dilation and parenchymal atrophy. These neoplasms have variable malignant potential."

Small-bowel hamartomas develop at a young age (average age, 18.5 years), and patients may present with rectal bleeding (most commonly), bowel obstruction, and intussusception. A clinical diagnosis of PJS may be made when two of the following three criteria are met: two or more PJS-type hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract; typical mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation (melanotic macules) in the mouth, buccal mucosa, nose, eyes, genitalia, or fingers; and family history of PJS. Patients with PJS have increased lifetime risk for multiple malignancies: colorectal (39%), gastric (29%), small bowel (13%), breast (32%-54%), ovarian/sex cord tumor with annular tubules (21%), cervical/adenoma malignum (1%), uterine (9%), testicular/Sertoli cell tumor (9%), lung (7%-17%), and pancreatic (11%-36%). The multiple melanotic macules present on this patient's lips are not seen in other familial polyposis syndromes. It is important to recognize that people without PJS may also have melanotic macules, most commonly on the lower lip, but macules may also be found on the gingiva, buccal mucosa, or tongue or within the genital mucosa. Solitary lesions are the rule, but multiple lesions suggest PJS."

These polyps are typically asymptomatic, smaller than 1 cm, and located in the gastric fundus and/or gastric body; they can be solitary but are more often multiple. They can be sporadic or can result from long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use (>12 months). Dysplasia is exceedingly rare; sporadic fundic gland polyps progressing to cancer have not been reported. In fact, dysplastic changes typically affect only polyps larger than 1 cm. Some polyp characteristics can raise concern: symptomatic polyps, polyps larger than 1 cm, polyps in the gastric antrum, or polyps with an abnormal appearance. In these patients, the polyp should be completely resected rather than being biopsied. Polyps later found to contain dysplasia on biopsy are also of concern, and repeat upper endoscopy should be promptly performed to completely remove these polyps. If fundic gland polyps are histologically confirmed and no dysplasia or concern for syndromic polyps is present (as in this patient), no further endoscopic follow-up is needed."

The finding of a carpet of fundic gland polyps (>50 polyps) in a young patient, especially one not taking a PPI, and/or the presence of dysplasia should raise suspicion for familial adenomatous polyposis and prompt further evaluation with a colonoscopy. In the setting of PPI-induced sporadic fundic gland polyps with no strong indication for PPI use, discontinuation of PPI should be discussed, although the data are mixed on whether PPI-associated sporadic fundic gland polyps regress after PPI discontinuation."

However, this rationale is of limited clinical use and is not cost-effective. As such, no U.S. or Canadian gastroenterology society has recommended routine surveillance for gastric ulcers. Instead, the decision to perform surveillance endoscopy for a gastric ulcer should be individualized. Surveillance with endoscopy is not necessary in patients with a low risk for gastric cancer, such as this patient, who was taking an NSAID and had endoscopic findings suggesting a typical NSAID-associated gastric ulcer, unremarkable biopsy specimens from the ulcer, and symptom resolution with appropriate medical therapy."

Manifestations include behavioral, cognitive, and motor abnormalities. Severity ranges from mild changes of psychomotor slowing to frank coma. Hepatic encephalopathy indicates decompensation of liver disease and signals worsening liver function. Immediate management centers on identifying precipitating factors and administering medications, such as lactulose, that decrease absorption of toxins, such as ammonia, from the colon. Common precipitants of hepatic encephalopathy include infections; gastrointestinal bleeding; exposure to toxins, such as alcohol; and medications with sedating properties, such as benzodiazepines and opiate analgesics. Use of these medications in patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy must be discontinued. Identification of culprit drug exposures may involve a careful review of mediations with family members, including medications that were prescribed by other clinicians or that were not prescribed but are being used by the patient, such as opioids or benzodiazepines."

Given the low risk for gastric cancer in the United States, routine use of endoscopic surveillance is not recommended for GIM. Surveillance should therefore be tailored to the characteristics of GIM in addition to risk factors. Risk factors for gastric cancer identified by the American Gastroenterological Association include the presence of incomplete or extensive GIM; having a first-degree relative with gastric cancer; race/ethnicity (African American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American/Alaskan Native); and/or being first- or second-generation immigrants from high-incidence areas, including South America, Central America, Mexico, Caribbean nations, East Asia, Southeast Asia, post-Soviet states, Iran, and Turkey. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends that individuals with higher risk should be considered for surveillance endoscopy based on shared decision-making in which the patient puts a high value on the possible increased risk for gastric cancer and a low value on the risks associated with repeat endoscopy. The optimal interval for surveillance endoscopy remains unknown; however, indirect data suggest a 3- to 5-year interval for endoscopy."

Symptomatic gallstone disease manifests as colicky pain resulting from stimulation of the gallbladder in the presence of an obstructive cystic duct from gallstones or sludge. This pain is typically of relatively acute onset, is fairly severe and steady, and is located in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. Pain may radiate to the right scapula and can be associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, lasting 30 minutes to 6 hours. This symptom complex may be precipitated by eating a fatty meal, which causes gallbladder contraction. Patients with unrelenting right-upper-quadrant or epigastric pain, bothersome early satiety, or postprandial fullness generally do not have biliary colic. Asymptomatic gallstones are commonly discovered when patients undergo abdominal imaging (CT or ultrasonography) for unrelated reasons. Incidental gallstones do not typically cause symptoms, and prophylactic cholecystectomy is generally not recommended."

This condition is less common than hepatopulmonary syndrome but carries a high mortality rate. Echocardiography is the best initial diagnostic test in a patient with suspected pulmonary hypertension.

Traveler's diarrhea usually occurs within the first 2 weeks of travel and is usually self-limited, lasting about 4 days; however, life-threatening volume depletion or severe colitis with systemic manifestations can occur. Some travelers develop chronic diarrhea or a postinfective irritable bowel syndrome. Fluid replacement is the mainstay of treatment, preferably by the oral route, with solutions that contain water, salt, and sugar. Antimotility drugs such as loperamide and diphenoxylate can be used in patients with mild or moderate traveler's diarrhea and as adjuvant therapy in patients treated with antibiotics.

Endoscopic therapy was appropriately performed to reduce the risk of rebleeding and mortality. To further reduce the risk of rebleeding and mortality following endoscopic therapy, high-dose PPI therapy should be provided either via continuous infusion or intermittently for 72 hours while the patient is hospitalized. Suggested continuous PPI therapy should consist of 80-mg bolus followed by 8-mg/hr infusion. Alternatively, intermittent oral or intravenous therapy should consist of an 80-mg bolus followed by a 40-mg bolus two to four times daily. The risk of rebleeding is further reduced by continuing the patient on twice-daily PPI therapy for a total of 2 weeks following the endoscopy (i.e., days 4 to 14 post therapeutic endoscopy)."

Microscopic colitis can be idiopathic, but medications, including NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have been associated with its development.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a neutrophilic dermatosis caused by IgA antibodies against tissue and epidermal transglutaminase. It typically presents with intensely pruritic papules and fragile vesicles that rapidly break, leaving tiny erosions. A skin biopsy specimen will show numerous neutrophils stuffing the dermal papillae, and a granular pattern of IgA deposition will be seen on direct immunofluorescence. Most patients with dermatitis herpetiformis will have an underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy. However, they are usually free of gastrointestinal symptoms; only 20% of patients with celiac disease will develop dermatitis herpetiformis. The distribution and morphology, in the context of a history of celiac disease, are compatible with dermatitis herpetiformis.

It is synergistic with alcohol in promoting morbidity related to pancreatic disease. Initial therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain should entail lifestyle modification, including alcohol and tobacco cessation, and simple analgesics. No direct evidence addresses whether alcohol cessation alters the natural history of chronic pancreatitis pain. However, several case series have suggested that discontinuing alcohol use improves the pain in chronic pancreatitis but does not necessarily alter the progression to endocrine or exocrine dysfunction. There is no direct evidence that smoking cessation is beneficial in improving the natural history of chronic pancreatitis. However, case series have shown a decrease in the amount of pancreatic calcification progression when smoking cessation occurs at the time of diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Both alcohol and smoking cessation are strongly recommended in the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guideline on chronic pancreatitis. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline may reduce pain from neuropathic conditions and therefore may be useful in patients with chronic pancreatitis. ACG makes no recommendation for or against these drug therapies in patients with chronic pancreatitis."

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher who do not have an increased risk for bleeding. In those aged 60 to 69 years, the benefits of aspirin use for primary prevention are smaller and the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin in this population should be individualized. The American College of Cardiology and American Diabetes Association suggest that low-dose aspirin might be considered for ASCVD primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk. This patient recently experienced hemodynamically significant lower gastrointestinal bleeding from diverticulosis. Although this bleeding was successfully treated, he is at considerable risk for recurrent bleeding from his diverticulosis.

"). The patient is mostly asymptomatic and has normal physical examination and laboratory findings. However, her celiac disease status is uncertain because she has been maintaining a gluten-free diet for the past year without having been tested for celiac disease. Her clinical improvement after starting a gluten-free diet may be due to celiac disease or to nonceliac gluten sensitivity, a clinical syndrome of unknown pathophysiology. Because gluten-containing foods can also contain nonabsorbable carbohydrates, such as fructans, they can cause gastrointestinal symptoms due to osmotic mechanisms, as well as fermentation by colonic bacteria. By definition, celiac disease must first be excluded before nonceliac gluten sensitivity is diagnosed. Although the tissue transglutaminase IgA level is normal, the patient's gluten-free diet reduces the sensitivity of this serologic test. Celiac disease testing should therefore be repeated while the patient is on a gluten-containing diet; gluten should be reintroduced daily, preferably for 1 to 3 months before testing."

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three criteria: (1) acute-onset abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis (severe, persistent for hours to days, and epigastric in location, often radiating to the back), (2) serum lipase or amylase levels elevated at least three times the upper limit of normal, and (3) characteristic imaging findings. Because acute pancreatitis is most commonly caused by biliary disorders, patients with acute pancreatitis should undergo transabdominal ultrasonography. Transabdominal ultrasonography is preferred over CT for detection of gallstones because it has a higher sensitivity for detection of gallstones, avoids the risks associated with intravenous contrast, and is more cost-effective. Imaging during this patient's hospitalization revealed multiple small gallstones in the gallbladder. Her common bile duct is normal in size and without choledocholithiasis; therefore, it is likely that a stone has passed through the common bile duct. Gallstone-induced acute pancreatitis can be caused by obstruction of the pancreatic duct or the ampulla, causing bile to reflux back into the pancreatic duct."
