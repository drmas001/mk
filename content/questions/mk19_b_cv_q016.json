Her admission CT angiogram revealed an aortic dissection beginning just distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the distal aorta just below the inferior mesenteric artery. Her symptoms responded to morphine, esmolol, and nitroprusside. Yesterday, esmolol was replaced with metoprolol. She is taking no other medications."

"). Type B aortic dissection involves the descending thoracic aorta, typically just distal to the left subclavian artery, and may extend into the abdominal aorta and lower extremity arteries; it does not involve the ascending aorta. Patients with uncomplicated type B aortic syndromes may be treated with medical therapy initially; however, aortic repair is indicated when type B aortic dissection is complicated by limb or end-organ ischemia, persistent severe hypertension, persistent pain, propagation of the dissection, enlargement of the descending aorta, and/or rupture of the aorta. This patient has propagation of a type B aortic dissection, as evidenced by new-onset abdominal pain (representing mesenteric ischemia) and the development of limb ischemia. Patients with type B aortic dissection should be preferentially managed with thoracic endovascular aortic repair, with the primary goal of sealing both proximal and distal segments of dissection. Surgical repair of the descending aorta is associated with high morbidity and mortality."

"The acute management of aortic dissection focuses on reducing blood pressure and shear stress. Rapid-acting β-blockers, such as esmolol, are initiated to reduce heart rate to less than 60/min; after the acute phase of treatment, an oral β-blocker such as metoprolol may replace intravenous esmolol. If blood pressure remains elevated, intravenous nitroprusside (",
