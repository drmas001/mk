"). The finding of an incidental adrenal mass prompts two key questions: (1) is the mass secreting excess hormone (aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines)?; and (2) is the mass benign or malignant? Biochemical testing for hypercortisolism should be undertaken in all patients with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass, even in the absence of typical symptoms; screening for pheochromocytoma is indicated if the unenhanced CT attenuation is greater than 10 Hounsfield units, even in the absence of hypertension. Most benign adrenal adenomas are smaller than 4 cm and have high lipid content, which corresponds to a density of less than 10 Hounsfield units, and contrast washout is greater than 60% in 10 minutes. This asymptomatic patient with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass has no evidence of hormone excess associated with mild autonomous cortisol excess and has a benign imaging phenotype. Clinical observation can also be considered. A large study of patients with small nonfunctioning adrenal tumors showed significant growth in only 2.5% of tumors at 50 months, and no cases of adrenal carcinoma were diagnosed. Clinically overt hormone excess developed in less than 0.1% of patients."
