"). Although arthralgia and myalgia often occur at the earlier stages of Lyme disease, Lyme arthritis is a late-stage manifestation. It is typically monoarticular, most commonly in the knee. It should be suspected in patients who may have had untreated or incompletely treated Lyme disease, although not all patients will have a history compatible with previous Lyme disease. All patients with Lyme arthritis, however, should have positive results on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot confirmatory serologies; this is the primary means of diagnosing Lyme arthritis, although a second enzyme immunoassay can be used as a confirmatory test.

" DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction in synovial fluid, but this test offers no advantage to serologic testing. Randomized controlled trials have suggested that 90% of patients with Lyme arthritis are effectively treated with a 28-day course of oral antibiotics. Doxycycline is the most widely recommended first choice in antibiotic treatment of Lyme arthritis. Treatment with a 28-day course of amoxicillin is an alternative first-line therapy. For patients whose arthritis improves but does not completely resolve, a second 28-day course of the same antibiotic can be prescribed. For pregnant and lactating women, tetracyclines are generally avoided in favor of a Î²-lactam antibiotic."
