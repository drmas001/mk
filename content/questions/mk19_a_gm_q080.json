She has a minimal cough productive of scant sputum. Two weeks ago, she finished pulmonary rehabilitation, which provided some improvement in symptoms. Her medications are inhaled vilanterol trifenatate, umeclidinium bromide, and fluticasone furoate."

") is the most appropriate next step in treating this patient's worsening dyspnea in the setting of severe COPD. Studies have shown that use of a handheld fan reduces breathlessness in this patient population and has no adverse effects; a handheld fan should be considered in all patients with refractory dyspnea. In some studies, up to 85% of patients report improvement in dyspnea and half of patients report an increase in physical activity. In patients with persistently debilitating symptoms despite maximal medical therapy, nonpharmacologic treatment strategies, such as pursed lip breathing, and devices that enhance airflow, such as a handheld fan, are the least invasive and easiest to administer to reduce the severity of dyspnea."
