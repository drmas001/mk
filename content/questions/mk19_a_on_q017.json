"). Immunotherapy is playing an increasingly important role in the management of patients with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer. Many different immunotherapy agents, mostly directed against the programmed death-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis, have been shown to be effective for the treatment of advanced non–small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy can be used as single-agent therapy based on expression of the PD-L1 biomarker. However, in patients without a driver mutation (epidermal growth factor receptor",
{

},
"children":[

},
"), the combination of pembrolizumab with carboplatin and pemetrexed has been shown to improve survival in those with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 level. This was shown in a randomized phase III trial that tested this combination in comparison to carboplatin/pemetrexed in the first-line treatment setting. This study found that the combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab improved survival regardless of PD-L1 status. Based on this result, the combination of pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is the preferred therapy for patients with good performance status who do not have a driver mutation. Contraindications to immunotherapy include connective tissue disease, rheumatologic diseases, or interstitial lung disease."
