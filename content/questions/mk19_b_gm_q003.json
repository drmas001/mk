") is the feature of the electronic health record (EHR) that most likely accounts for the physician's decision to modify the patient's prescription. The EHR is a computerized system that encompasses patient record review and treatment-ordering functionality for clinicians. The EHR enables the timely sharing of patient information by multiple users, resulting in improved communication and care efficiency. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) is a system by which clinicians electronically enter medication, radiology, and laboratory orders, thereby reducing errors and delays related to illegible handwriting. Computerized CDS is the use of information technology to facilitate clinical decision making. When integrated into a CPOE system, CDS can highlight potential contraindications to diagnostic tests, specify dose recommendations, identify potential drug interactions, and suggest modifications to drug dosage in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction. In this case, the physician was going to prescribe this patient full-dose rivaroxaban to reduce the risk for stroke caused by atrial fibrillation. However, many direct oral anticoagulants require dosage adjustment in patients with advanced kidney disease because decreased kidney clearance of these medications may be associated with adverse events. The CDS system notified the physician of the contraindication to use full-dose rivaroxaban in this patient and prevented the potential harm."
