"The most likely diagnosis is drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), a severe life-threatening medication reaction. Symptoms begin with fever and flulike symptoms, quickly followed by burning skin pain and rash. Patients typically develop a morbilliform exanthem that starts on the face and upper trunk and spreads distally. Eventually the patient develops striking facial edema and redness, a hallmark of DIHS. Oral mucosal involvement is common. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is also a widely used term for DIHS. The most common medications that cause DIHS include sulfonamide antibiotics, allopurinol, and anticonvulsants. Unlike other severe medication reactions, the onset of symptoms is delayed, often 2 to 6 weeks following exposure."
