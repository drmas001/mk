The pain has since diminished, but progressive left-thigh weakness and muscle wasting are now present. He has hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, and alcohol use disorder. Current medications are levothyroxine, metformin, and canagliflozin."

Sensory perception to light touch and pinprick is diminished over the left medial thigh and dorsum of the left foot. Left anterior thigh muscles are weak and wasted. Fasciculation is noted in left quadriceps and lumbar paraspinal muscles. Examination of the toes reveals a flexor plantar response. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are absent on the left side and diminished on the right side. The rest of the neurologic examination is normal."

"), a subacute lumbosacral plexopathy that can present in patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes often causes a distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy, but other neuromuscular manifestations, including mononeuropathy, radiculopathy, small-fiber and autonomic neuropathies, and plexopathies are also possible. Onset of diabetic amyotrophy is often acute or subacute, with asymmetric prominent pain followed by proximal weakness and muscle loss. Sensory loss may occur to a variable degree. Electromyography often reveals diffuse denervation and axon loss. MRI of the lumbar spine and CT of the abdomen and pelvis are indicated to rule out alternative causes, such as cauda equina syndrome and retroperitoneal hematoma. Management consists of supportive measures, physical therapy, and pain control; despite sporadic reports of benefit from immunomodulatory therapies, the benefit of these therapies remains unproven."
