") usually occurs in patients aged 40 to 70 years. The cause appears to involve glenohumeral joint capsular thickening and fibrosis. Patients describe shoulder pain that is often constant but is worse at night and in cold weather; shoulder stiffness is common. Adhesive capsulitis can be idiopathic but is also associated with prolonged immobilization, antecedent shoulder surgery or injury, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disorders. On examination, patients have limited passive and active range of motion in all directions. Plain radiographs are of limited diagnostic use in patients with adhesive capsulitis; most often the radiographs are normal, except for osteopenia in some cases. This patient's abnormal shoulder radiograph is not consistent with adhesive capsulitis."

") is an unlikely diagnosis. Although it may involve the shoulder joint, it is typically associated with osteoarthritis, not severe erosive joint destruction. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals, which are weakly positively birefringent (blue when parallel to and yellow when perpendicular to the polarizing axis of an optical filter) and classically rhomboid-shaped, are usually identified in the joint fluid. Chondrocalcinosis, visible as a thin white line that tracks below the surface layer of the cartilage within the joint, may be visible on plain radiograph. Extensive soft-tissue calcification such as seen in this radiograph is not typical of CPPD."
