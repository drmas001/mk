The most common causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ICU are ventilation/perfusion mismatch and shunt, which occur when perfused areas of the lung are not ventilated, whether because of alveolar collapse (atelectasis) or filling of alveoli with blood, pus, protein, or water. An increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient is the key feature of ventilation/perfusion mismatch and shunt but is normal in this patient."

With shunting significant enough to cause hypoxemia, the alveolar-arterial gradient will be abnormal. Considering this patient's rapidly ascending paralysis, abnormal spirometry measures, and normal alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, neuromuscular weakness is a more likely cause of her respiratory failure."
