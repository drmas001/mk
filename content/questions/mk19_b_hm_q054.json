Furthermore, she has a score of 1 (pulse rate â‰¥110/min) on the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), which places her at high risk for adverse outcomes and necessitates treatment in the hospital. Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that is approved to treat acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) without concomitant parenteral therapy on initiation; it can be used in patients with kidney injury and does not require dose adjustment for VTE treatment, even in patients undergoing dialysis. Rivaroxaban, another direct factor Xa inhibitor, would also be a treatment option for this patient. For patients with VTE, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) suggests using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban, over vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin. Dabigatran and edoxaban, like warfarin, require a transition period with parenteral therapy before continuing the oral treatment."

"For patients with VTE and significant preexisting cardiopulmonary disease, as well as for patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) and hemodynamic compromise, the ASH guideline suggests anticoagulation alone rather than anticoagulation plus insertion of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter; the guideline also suggests that an IVC filter may be considered in patients with an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. This patient has no contraindication to anticoagulation, so an IVC filter would not be indicated (",

"). For patients with PE and echocardiographic evidence or biomarkers compatible with right ventricular dysfunction without hemodynamic compromise (submassive PE), the ASH guideline suggests anticoagulation alone instead of thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulation. The 2021 CHEST guideline recommends against thrombolytic therapy in most patients with acute PE not associated with hypotension. This patient does not have massive PE, so thrombolytic therapy would not be appropriate."
