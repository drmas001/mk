"). As much as one fifth of the American work force maintains a job schedule outside of usual day shift hours. Although some people acclimate well to this schedule, many experience excessive sleepiness, mood perturbations, and neurocognitive dysfunction. Symptoms persisting at least 3 months meet the criteria for shift work sleep disorder. Management should first include counseling that takes into consideration eliminating shift work. If this is not feasible, then education about symptom management should be pursued. This patient has difficulty falling asleep after her nighttime shift. Education on avoidance of direct sunlight in the early morning (using sunglasses or a dark bedroom) and avoidance of exertion, eating, and alcohol consumption before the morning sleep period should be provided. Daytime sleepiness may respond to use of caffeinated beverages, bright-light exposure during the work shift, and if feasible, a short (30-minute) nap, perhaps during a meal break."

"), which uses respiratory tools and/or noninvasive measurements of vascular tone, pulse oximetry, and an accelerometer to detect posture, is indicated when there is strong pretest evidence of obstructive sleep apnea. The suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea in a young woman of normal weight is low; in addition, her main symptoms are difficulty falling asleep and associated daytime sleepiness. If the patient's symptoms persist after conservative therapy, in-laboratory polysomnography could be considered for a more comprehensive evaluation."
