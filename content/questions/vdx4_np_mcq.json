The degree of retinal arterial narrowing is assessed by comparing arteriolar diameter relative to retinal venule diameter (arteriole-to-venule ratio); venule diameters do not vary substantially in most patients with hypertension. An arteriole-to-venule ratio less than 1 suggests relative arteriolar narrowing; this patient's arteriole-to-venule ratio is 0.63. Arteriolar narrowing is a predictor of future development of hypertension and increased risk for stroke. Evidence also indicates that arteriolar narrowing is associated with coronary artery disease and kidney damage."

Atheroembolic events can occur spontaneously or several days to weeks after manipulation of the aorta. Plaque rupture causes cholesterol embolization to distal small- and medium-sized arteries, resulting in ischemia with end-organ damage. In addition to the kidneys, atheroemboli can affect the arteries in the skin, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, liver, eyes, and central nervous system. Apart from livedo reticularis, physical examination findings may also include Hollenhorst plaques on funduscopic examination (yellow refractile emboli within retinal arteries), ulcerations, and blue toe syndrome caused by ischemia."

The glomerular hematuria seen in the nephritic syndrome can be distinguished from other causes of urinary tract bleeding by the presence of either dysmorphic erythrocytes (resulting from distortion that occurs as they pass through the glomerular basement membrane and then along the renal tubules) or erythrocyte casts on urine microscopy. Red blood cells lack a nucleus, which helps to distinguish them for other nucleated cell types. Common features of glomerulonephritis are hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic) and proteinuria, with the more severe forms typically including hypertension, edema, and kidney dysfunction (elevated serum creatinine)."

". Parathyroid hormone levels are often dramatically elevated as a secondary process in ESKD. Although the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, patients with ESKD exhibit abnormalities in the endothelial cells, which allow for an abnormal deposition of calcium within the lumen of the dermal arterioles. As the calcium deposition increases, small thromboses form that lead to ischemia and infarctions of the overlying tissue. The tissue becomes necrotic, painful, and a potential source for secondary infection that may lead to sepsis and death. Treatment is usually supportive with pain control. Aggressive control of calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone is recommended."

If the clinical presentation is not entirely consistent with diabetic nephropathy, a kidney biopsy is performed. The biopsy finding of nodular mesangial sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules) with glomerular and tubular basement thickening, in the absence of immune deposits, is the classic description of diabetic nephropathy."
