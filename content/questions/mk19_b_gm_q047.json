"). Weight loss is rapid during the first few months after bariatric surgery. Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, patients lose on average 4.5 to 7 kg (10-15 lb) per month, and at 6 months, the average weight loss is as much as 36 kg (80 lb). Weight should be monitored closely in the early postoperative period. As patients lose weight, frequent reassessment of medications is required. In patients with diabetes mellitus, symptoms of hypoglycemia should be sought. Because of the potential harmful effects of hypoglycemia, preemptive lowering or discontinuation of some hypoglycemic agents is recommended to prevent the development of hypoglycemia. Discontinuing this patient's basal insulin now is reasonable considering her near-normal fasting blood glucose levels."
