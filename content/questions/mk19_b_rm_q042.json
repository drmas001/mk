The pain worsened after she began a new exercise program that includes weights, and it is exacerbated with use. The pain makes it hard to lift things. She also has increased fatigue. Acetaminophen partially alleviates the pain."

"), such as fibromyalgia, have hyperresponsive pain centers in the brain and spinal cord. Patients characteristically note allodynia (a heightened sensitivity to stimuli that are not normally painful) and hyperalgesia (an increased response to painful stimuli). An additional characteristic feature is “wind-up” or temporal summation. When repeatedly exposed to a mildly uncomfortable stimulus, patients with fibromyalgia experience progressively additive pain, indicating that the pain stimuli are both persistent and inadequately damped. Finally, patients typically have diffuse rather than localized pain. This patient has no features characteristic of a central pain processing disorder. The local nature of her pain also argues against fibromyalgia, which is a disease of widespread pain."
