Her PHQ-9 score was 14 before she started CBT and is now 9, indicating mild depression. After discussing the benefits and harms, it is decided to initiate sertraline. The patient is taking no other prescription or over-the-counter medications."

Serotonin syndrome can develop in patients taking any SSRI or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), bupropion, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, alone or in combination with other prescription medications (such as opioids and triptans) or over-the-counter medications (such as dextromethorphan). Symptoms usually develop within 24 hours of initiating therapy or a change in dose, or of initiating an interacting drug. Serotonin syndrome may be mild, with symptoms of anxiety, tremor, restlessness, or diarrhea, or may present with high fever, muscle rigidity, and cognitive changes. Findings unique to serotonin syndrome are shivering, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, ocular clonus (slow, continuous, horizontal eye movements), and ataxia."

") is a reaction to certain classes of drugs, including inhaled anesthetics (halothane and others) and depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine and decamethonium). It causes markedly increased intracellular calcium, increased cellular metabolism, and sustained muscle tetany. Severe muscle rigidity, masseter spasm, hyperthermia (core temperature up to 45 °C [113.0 °F]), cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and rhabdomyolysis usually manifest quickly when susceptible patients are exposed to a triggering agent. This patient has not been exposed to the implicated drugs."

The patient is not taking medications associated with this syndrome."
