"). A history of influenza vaccination does not preclude an influenza diagnosis. Reasons for infection despite immunization include an inability to mount an immunologic response or discordance between vaccine strains and those circulating in the community. A positive influenza test result does not exclude the possibility of a bacterial coinfection, so when influenza is suspected or confirmed, antibiotic therapy should be given in addition to antiviral treatment. Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommend starting oseltamivir in all adults with CAP and laboratory-confirmed influenza independent of symptom duration. Therefore, a positive rapid influenza NAAT would influence management, and testing should be performed routinely on patients with CAP during seasons when influenza activity is present in the community."
