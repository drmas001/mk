CSA is defined by pauses in breathing due to a loss of output from the central respiratory generators in the brainstem to the muscles that make up the respiratory pump. CSA is typically associated with comorbid conditions, most commonly heart failure. Other risk factors include atrial fibrillation and opioid use. The respiratory tracing from the polysomnogram shows the classic configuration of Cheyne-Stokes breathing in CSA, with a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of airflow and intervening breathing pauses as blood carbon dioxide tension falls and the stimulus to breathe dissipates."

Sustained reductions in oxyhemoglobin saturation (<90% for at least 5 minutes or >30% total sleep time by oximetry or polysomnography) in the setting of a compatible medical condition signify a hypoventilation syndrome. OSA may or may not be an associated feature. The patient's clinical picture and Cheyne-Stokes respiratory tracing are not consistent with sleep-related hypoventilation syndrome."
