"). This patient with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) presents with a new MS relapse, triggered by the development of a new, active cerebellar lesion. The first-line treatment for an MS relapse is high-dose glucocorticoids, typically administered as intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/d for 3 to 5 days). Patients treated with methylprednisolone have a significant reduction in the risk of either worsening or not improving within 5 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. Oral equivalency studies have shown that oral methylprednisolone (1 g/d) or prednisone (1250 mg/d) may act as viable alternatives to this regimen. Frequent or prolonged glucocorticoid treatment should be avoided to minimize the risks of osteopenia and early cataracts. Any patient with a suspected relapse should be screened for causes of Uhthoff phenomenon masquerading as a relapse (or “pseudorelapse”) to avoid unnecessary treatment. The Uhthoff phenomenon describes a transient worsening of baseline neurologic symptoms in the setting of hot weather, physical exertion, or fever."
