Linezolid is an oxazolidinone drug with bacteriostatic activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and it has performed well in randomized controlled trials compared with vancomycin for pneumonia. The pharmacokinetics of linezolid in the lung are favorable, and it is an excellent alternative to vancomycin for treating MRSA. An important side effect of linezolid is myelosuppression, notably thrombocytopenia. Weekly complete blood counts should be obtained in patients treated with linezolid."
