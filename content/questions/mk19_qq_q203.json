"), an uncommon condition that involves a gradual decrease in blood flow to the small intestine over months to years. It most commonly results from atherosclerotic narrowing of the mesenteric arteries. The classic symptom triad of CMI is postprandial abdominal pain, sitophobia (fear of eating), and weight loss. However, this triad occurs in only 30% of patients with CMI, and CMI should be suspected in the setting of recurrent postprandial abdominal pain. Diagnosis requires symptoms, exclusion of alternative causes of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss, and compatible radiographic findings. CT angiography (CTA) of the abdomen is the most useful test in the evaluation of mesenteric lesions and also aids in the evaluation of alternative diagnoses. MR angiography appears to be less valuable than CTA in the assessment of inferior mesenteric artery pathology but is preferred in patients with abnormal kidney function. It is recommended that patients with CMI and multivessel disease undergo revascularization, but the choice is less clear when only one artery is involved. Endovascular revascularization is usually the first choice, but its failure, as well as the presence of vasculitic or heavily calcified arteries, may require open surgery."

This patient's significant vascular disease, pain within 1 hour of eating, weight loss, and abdominal bruit argue more convincingly for chronic mesenteric ischemia."
