His only medication is atorvastatin."

") is the most appropriate cardioprotective medication for this patient. The patient's chest pain symptoms, which occur with exertion and subside with rest, are consistent with angina. Therefore, he has a high pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease and is a candidate for secondary preventive therapy. All patients with stable ischemic heart disease should receive guideline-directed therapies consisting of risk factor modification with regular physical exercise, attention to diet, weight loss, and smoking cessation, as well as cardioprotective therapy to improve prognosis and antianginal medication as needed to improve functional capacity. The Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration collaborative meta-analysis of nearly 3000 patients with stable ischemic heart disease found an association between aspirin use and reduced risk for serious vascular events, including a 46% decrease in the risk for unstable angina and a 53% risk reduction in the need for coronary angioplasty. Therefore, in the absence of contraindications, antiplatelet therapy in the form of low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg/d) is indicated indefinitely for secondary prevention to reduce the risk for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. In patients who have an intolerance or allergy to aspirin, clopidogrel therapy is considered an acceptable alternative. Aspirin desensitization is another approach."
