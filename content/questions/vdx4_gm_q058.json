"The most likely diagnosis is vitiligo, a common acquired autoimmune condition characterized by the loss of function or absence of melanocytes. Clinically, it appears as completely depigmented, well-demarcated symmetric macules or patches with no scale. Its onset is insidious and asymptomatic, starting as small macules that gradually enlarge. The most commonly affected areas are the extensor surfaces, such as the dorsal hands and feet, elbows, and knees, and the periorificial areas, such as around the mouth, eyes, rectum, and genitals. Vitiligo can occur at any age and affects both sexes equally. It may be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease."
