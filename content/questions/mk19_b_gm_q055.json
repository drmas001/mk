The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for osteoporosis in all women aged 65 years or older and in women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk for osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool. This patient presents with several risk factors for osteoporosis and, most important, bone fracture. This patient's risk factors include low body weight (BMI of 21), cigarette smoking, and family history of hip fracture. The Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) is a commonly used clinical risk assessment tool (available at ",

"). Women with a 10-year FRAX risk for major osteoporotic fracture equal to or higher than that of a 65-year-old woman without additional risk factors (10-year risk of 8.4%) should undergo screening for osteoporosis. Screening can be accomplished with bone mineral density (BMD) measurement, most commonly with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the hip and lumbar spine."
