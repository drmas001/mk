"A 27-year-old man is evaluated during a follow-up visit. He recently visited the emergency department for a burn sustained while setting off fireworks at a party while intoxicated. He has a history of depression but never followed up for treatment. Since that time, he reports that his mood has improved remarkably, and he is able to stay up “all night if I need to” to catch up on work. He has elaborate plans for starting his own cybersecurity business, running for city council, and working on an invention to prevent power grid failures. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable."

"). This patient's impulsive behavior, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, and inflated mood suggest mania, and the previous diagnosis of depression suggests the diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder. Diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1 disorder include symptoms of depression plus at least one episode of mania characterized by one or more of the following: elevated mood, irritability, inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, flight of ideas, distractibility, or increased risk-taking behavior. Initial symptoms often present in the late teens to early twenties. A careful history directed at identifying previous episodes of mania or hypomania should be obtained when initially diagnosing depression; prescribing antidepressant monotherapy to a patient with bipolar disorder may precipitate a manic episode. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire can be used to screen patients in the primary care setting. Bipolar 1 disorder should be managed by a psychiatrist; in the setting of acute mania, urgent referral is appropriate."
