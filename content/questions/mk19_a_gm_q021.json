"). Pain in the hip can be predominantly anterior, lateral, or posterior. Anterior and posterior hip pain can be intra-articular or extra-articular. Posterior hip pain associated with positive results on the FADIR (Flexion, ADduction, and Internal Rotation) test, as seen in this patient, strongly suggests osteoarthritis. Examples of extra-articular causes of posterior hip pain include lumbar radiculopathy, vascular claudication, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and gluteal tendinopathy. Pain associated with radiation down the leg suggests lumbar radiculopathy, whereas concomitant exertional leg pain or peripheral vascular disease suggests vascular claudication. These causes of posterior hip pain are not associated with positive results on the FADIR test. Acetabular labrum injury (labrum tear) is an example of an extra-articular cause of anterior hip pain; osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis are examples of intra-articular causes. Anterior or posterior hip pain that starts insidiously and worsens with standing and activity in older patients suggests osteoarthritis. The same pain characteristics in a younger person with anterior hip pain raise concern for a labral tear, especially when accompanied by painful clicking or catching. Gradual onset of anterior hip pain can also occur with avascular necrosis (or osteonecrosis), which should be considered in the presence of alcohol abuse, glucocorticoid use, systemic lupus erythematosus, or sickle cell anemia."
