") to control this patient's acute severe somatic and neuropathic pain caused by calciphylaxis. Hydromorphone is a μ-opioid receptor agonist that is primarily metabolized by the liver and is also cleared during hemodialysis, which gives it a more favorable safety profile than other opioids for patients with kidney disease or on dialysis. Neuroexcitatory metabolites can accumulate between dialysis treatments, and care still must be taken to prevent toxicity. Although the enteral route should be used whenever possible, parenteral opioids are appropriate for immediate control of severe pain because of their rapid onset of action, within 5 to 15 minutes. After intravenous hydromorphone administration, this patient's underlying condition should be evaluated and treated, and the patient should be rotated to oral opioid therapy once the acute severe pain is controlled. The state prescription drug monitoring database should be reviewed to identify previous prescriptions for the patient, which will help inform further treatment and the eventual transition to oral medication."
