") is the best predictor of severe disease in this patient with acute pancreatitis. He has abdominal pain with characteristic features, including acute onset, epigastric location, and radiation to the back. Serum amylase and lipase levels are usually elevated at least three times the upper limit of normal. Risk factors for severe pancreatitis include age older than 55 years, medical comorbidities, obesity, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Hypovolemia is also a risk factor for morbidity, which can be identified by a serum BUN level greater than 20 mg/dL (7.14 mmol/L), hematocrit level greater than 44%, or elevated serum creatinine level. BUN is the most reliable routine laboratory study to predict mortality. For every 5.0-mg/dL (1.79-mmol/L) increase in BUN during the first 24 hours, the age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio for mortality increases by 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-2.7)."

"Patients with acute pancreatitis should undergo transabdominal ultrasonography to assess for gallstones and biliary duct dilation. Transabdominal ultrasonography is preferred over CT because it has a higher sensitivity for detecting gallstones, avoids the risks of intravenous contrast material, and is more cost-effective. Although less useful for assessing the biliary system, CT may be indicated if the diagnosis is in question or clinical symptoms are not improved within the first 48 hours (especially because abdominal air can limit ultrasonographic visualization of the pancreas).
