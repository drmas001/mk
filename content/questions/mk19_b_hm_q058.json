"). Evidence regarding the proper management of catheter-related thrombosis is sparse and weak. Many of the recommendations focus on patients with cancer. In general, central venous catheters (CVCs) that are associated with upper extremity thrombosis can remain in place as long as the catheter is functioning, remains well positioned, and is not infected. In patients who have upper extremity thrombosis associated with a CVC that is removed, guidelines recommend 3 months of anticoagulation over a longer duration of therapy. In patients who have upper extremity thrombosis that is associated with a CVC that is not removed, guidelines recommend that anticoagulation be continued as long as the CVC remains in place. This patient will require anticoagulation while the catheter is in place for the next 4 weeks to complete 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. After the catheter is removed, anticoagulation should be provided for an additional 2 months to complete a total of 3 months of anticoagulation."
