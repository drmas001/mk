A classic diagnostic triad of peptic ulcer perforation is sudden onset of abdominal pain, tachycardia, and abdominal rigidity. Although PUD may be an incidental endoscopic finding, some patients experience epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, and bleeding, manifested as melena or hematochezia. Possible causes of PUD include Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, glucocorticoids, and bisphosphonates, but ",
