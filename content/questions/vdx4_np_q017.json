"Type 1 cryoglobulinemia is more commonly associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. Types II and III cryoglobulinemias are mixed cryoglobulinemias, and both can be associated with hepatitis C virus infection. Kidney manifestations can include elevated serum creatinine level, hypertension, proteinuria, and hematuria. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is usually noted on biopsy. Occasionally, a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescent formation can occur. Treatment is directed at the underlying condition, but plasmapheresis to treat hyperviscosity syndrome and immunosuppressive medications for treatment of vasculitis may also be needed."
