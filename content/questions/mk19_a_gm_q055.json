"). Acute cough (<3 weeks' duration) is most often caused by viral infections involving the upper respiratory tract and bronchial airways. Coronaviruses and rhinoviruses are the most common causative pathogens, but influenza virus should be highly suspected in patients presenting with fever and myalgia, especially during influenza season (between autumn and early spring). Treatment of acute cough is primarily symptomatic and dependent on the underlying etiology. The mainstay of treatment of bronchitis is patient education and reassurance that the cough usually resolves in 2 to 3 weeks."
