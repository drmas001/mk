"). Mounting evidence implicates an inflammatory/infectious cause of Bell palsy that is most likely due to human herpesvirus 1. The peripheral facial nerve involvement seen in Bell palsy causes widespread facial paralysis, including paralysis of upper and lower facial muscles and an inability to close the eyes tightly or raise the eyebrows. Patients also report dry mouth, hyperacusis, impaired taste, and pain and numbness near the ear. Abrupt onset with building symptoms over 1 to 2 days is typical. Early treatment with oral glucocorticoids, usually a 10-day course of prednisone, increases the probability of recovery if initiated within the first 72 hours. Patients with impaired eye closure should be advised to use lubricating eyedrops/ointment and nighttime eye taping to prevent corneal damage. If ocular symptoms of pain, itching, or irritation occur, referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended."
