"), or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and is the most appropriate management for this patient. In patients with proteinuria, treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs lowers intraglomerular pressure resulting in decreased protein excretion and often slows the rate of declining kidney function. Acute decline in glomerular filtration rate and hyperkalemia are well-recognized potential adverse effects of these drugs, mandating monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium levels. Antiproteinuric therapy is usually coupled with lipid-lowering therapy and fish oil, although the efficacy of the latter two as specific IgAN therapies is unproven."

"), would not be used for this patient. Although two thirds of patients with IgAN will have progressive loss of kidney function, the use of immunosuppressive therapy remains controversial. Small studies have shown that a 6-month course of prednisone reduces proteinuria and slows decline in glomerular filtration rate in patients with IgAN and >1000 mg/24 h proteinuria despite maximal therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. However, two large randomized controlled trials (STOP-IgAN and TESTING) called into question this management. The STOP-IgAN study showed no difference in changes in kidney function between those patients with IgAN treated with or without immunosuppression over a 3-year period. The TESTING study was terminated early due to significantly higher rates of adverse events in patients with IgAN who were treated with prednisone. As a result, treatment efficacy could not be determined. Because this patient has not yet been treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, consideration of immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone is premature."
