"). This patient has a 50–pack-year smoking history. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), one-time abdominal ultrasonography is the preferred screening modality for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged 65 to 75 years who have smoked at least five packs of cigarettes in their lifetime (grade B). Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive, is simple to perform, has high sensitivity (94%-100%) and specificity (98%-100%) for detecting AAA, and does not expose patients to radiation. Abdominal ultrasonography screening can also be performed selectively in men in the same age range who have not smoked but are at increased risk for peripheral vascular disease or who have a first-degree relative who had an AAA (grade C). The USPSTF assessed the benefits of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked as uncertain and makes no recommendation regarding screening in this population (I statement). The USPSTF specifically recommends against routine screening in women who have never smoked and who have no family history of AAA (grade D). Smoking cessation and treatment of hypertension can prevent the development of aneurysmal disease."
