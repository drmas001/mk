"). Approximately 60% to 90% of adults have latent cytomegalovirus infection, with reactivation of disease common in persons who are immunosuppressed (e.g., patients with AIDS, transplant recipients, patients taking glucocorticoids). Cytomegalovirus is a significant pathogen in solid organ transplant recipients. The risk of cytomegalovirus infection is highest when a seronegative recipient (one who has never had a cytomegalovirus infection) receives a solid organ from a seropositive donor. Cytomegalovirus can cause retinitis (especially in persons with AIDS), pneumonitis, hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, colitis with bloody diarrhea (such as in this patient), esophagitis, and adrenalitis. This patient underwent liver transplantation and has bloody diarrhea consistent with cytomegalovirus reactivation. Diagnosis relies on isolation of the virus from bodily fluids, such as serum; detection of cytomegalovirus p65 antigen in leukocytes; cytopathic demonstration of “owl's eye” intracellular inclusions from tissue biopsy; polymerase chain reaction; and serologic assays."

This patient has no generalized lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, and bloody diarrhea is not a common presentation of PTLD."

It would be unusual to see BK nephropathy in liver transplant recipients. It can present with a gradual, asymptomatic increase in the serum creatinine level with tubulointerstitial nephritis or, less commonly, ureteral stenosis. Patients may have polyoma BK virus on polymerase chain reaction of the urine or serum or may have polyoma BK virus inclusion-bearing epithelial cells called “decoy cells” on urine microscopy. Polyoma BK virus does not cause bloody diarrhea as in this patient."
