Other physical examination features of male breast cancer include nipple involvement/retraction (approximately 40%-50% of cases) overlying skin changes or ulceration, and axillary adenopathy. Gynecomastia is a benign proliferation of glandular tissue in males, and patients with gynecomastia of relatively recent onset may experience breast tenderness, but this finding is unusual in male breast cancer. Only 0.2% of all cancers in men are male breast cancer. The highest rates of male breast cancer are found in those with Klinefelter syndrome and those with a family history of ",

Chest irradiation is also a risk factor. Male breast cancer has been associated with gynecomastia, particularly if unilateral or asymmetric, and should always be included in the differential diagnosis."
