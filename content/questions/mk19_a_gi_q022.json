IBS is a common cause of diarrhea and can be diagnosed on clinical grounds, including history and physical examination. Although an extensive workup for structural abnormalities is not indicated in the absence of alarm symptoms, fecal calprotectin testing to assess for inflammatory bowel disease and stool testing for giardiasis and celiac disease should be considered in patients with chronic diarrhea."
