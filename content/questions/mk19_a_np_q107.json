") should be discontinued in this patient before conception. Before discontinuation of mycophenolate and attempted conception, steps should be taken to ensure disease stability in this patient. Pregnancy planning is essential for ensuring positive outcomes and includes adjusting medications and optimizing clinical status. This patient is taking mycophenolate mofetil, a teratogenic agent that is contraindicated in pregnancy. Documented risks with mycophenolate mofetil use include first-trimester pregnancy loss and fetal malformations of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidneys, and cleft lip and palate. Mycophenolate mofetil is also contraindicated in women who are breastfeeding because the drug is excreted into breast milk. This patient should discontinue this agent and, if continued immunosuppression is required, be switched to azathioprine, which is generally safer and well tolerated in pregnancy. In diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in which mycophenolate mofetil is commonly used, patients should show stable disease for 3 to 6 months following discontinuation of the agent before proceeding with pregnancy."

Hydroxychloroquine is initiated in every patient with SLE who can tolerate it, because evidence suggests it reduces disease-associated damage, prevents disease flares, and improves kidney and overall survival. In addition, hydroxychloroquine may reduce the risk for thrombosis, liver disease, and myocardial infarction; improve lipid profiles; and improve outcomes in high-risk pregnancies."

Steps can be taken to reduce the risk of glucocorticoid therapy during pregnancy, including using the lowest dose possible for the shortest period of time; carefully managing preexisting medical conditions that may be exacerbated by glucocorticoid therapy (for example, osteoporosis, diabetes, and hypertension); and carefully monitoring for treatment adverse effects and providing early intervention should they arise."
