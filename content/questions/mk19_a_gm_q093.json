"A 53-year-old woman is evaluated during a follow-up appointment for a multiyear history of chronic back pain in the setting of osteoporotic compression fractures. In addition to nonpharmacologic treatment, including exercise, she has previously undergone vertebroplasty, facet joint injections, medial branch blocks with radiofrequency ablation, and transforaminal epidural glucocorticoid injections. Her pain is not well controlled with gabapentin, topical lidocaine patches, and an oral NSAID, resulting in interference with work and leisure activities. Other medications include zoledronic acid, vitamin D, and calcium."

") is the most appropriate next step in management. This patient has tried several different targeted interventions for her pain and currently adheres to a reasonable nonopioid adjuvant strategy. Despite these treatments, she continues to have persistent pain that interferes with function. Consideration of opioid therapy is not unreasonable. Assessment of opioid risk should be an initial step in the decision-making process between the clinician and patient about whether to start opioids. The process should include a discussion of treatment goals, the patient's individualized risks, potential benefits of therapy, and ongoing monitoring strategies that will be part of the treatment agreement. The Opioid Risk Tool is one example of a screening tool that can be administered in the office to help clinicians stratify a patient's risk for opioid misuse as low, moderate, or high."

Treatment may be continued for 2 to 4 weeks. The evidence of effectiveness is weak, but calcitonin may be helpful as an adjuvant treatment in the context of acute vertebral fracture. This patient has chronic pain due to osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and calcitonin is not indicated."
