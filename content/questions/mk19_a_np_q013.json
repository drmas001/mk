") is needed for this pregnant patient with chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension is defined as hypertension starting before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, and adopted by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the diagnosis of hypertension before pregnancy is based on systolic blood pressure >130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure >80 mm Hg. This patient is at 24 weeks' gestation and has no proteinuria or other evidence of end-organ damage; the diagnosis is most consistent with chronic hypertension. A 2014 Cochrane systematic review of 49 trials (4723 women) concluded that treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension reduced the risk for developing severe hypertension but had no effect on the incidence of preeclampsia, preterm birth, fetal death, fetal growth restriction, or any other measured outcome. Antihypertensive treatment is not necessary at this time. For pregnant women with chronic hypertension, the 2019 ACOG Taskforce on Hypertension in Pregnancy recommends only treating persistent systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥110 mm Hg to avoid overtreatment of hypertension and associated fetal risk. In the setting of comorbidities or underlying impaired kidney function, treating at lower blood pressure thresholds may be appropriate. Blood pressure goals with medications are 120-159/80-109 mm Hg. First-line agents are labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa."
