"). Optimal management of fibromyalgia requires a holistic approach, including education, exercise, and psychosocial support. Pharmacotherapy is often warranted, although nonpharmacologic measures remain a cornerstone of treatment. Pregabalin, an antiepileptic drug, improves quality of life and decreases pain. It is one of only a few medications that are FDA approved for treating fibromyalgia. The medication should be initiated at low doses at night (i.e., 50 or 75 mg at bedtime) and slowly titrated as tolerated up to a maximum dosage of 225 mg twice daily. Common adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and peripheral edema. Weight gain of 7% or more is seen in nearly 10% of patients. Off-label use of gabapentin, another antiepileptic drug, has demonstrated effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial and is frequently used for this disorder in dosages up to 600 mg twice daily."

") would be appropriate in a patient with fibromyalgia, particularly one with depression, but not in one receiving escitalopram. Adding a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atop a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor would pose an unacceptable risk for serotonin syndrome. Duloxetine is otherwise an appropriate medication to use in fibromyalgia, at a dosage of up to 60 mg daily; consultation with the patient's psychiatrist would be essential if duloxetine needed to be considered. Other medications that would be appropriate for a patient not already taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor would include milnacipran and off-label use of tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and nortriptyline)."

Many states have passed laws legalizing the use of cannabis or allowing its use for certain medical conditions, although it is still classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as a schedule I agent. Current data on the effectiveness of medical cannabis for chronic pain are characterized by significant heterogeneity in both patient populations and cannabis preparations. There are no high-quality data on the efficacy of medical cannabis specifically for fibromyalgia."
