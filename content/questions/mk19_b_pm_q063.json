Pulmonary rehabilitation integrates exercise training, education, and nutritional and social support for patients with chronic lung conditions. It has numerous benefits, including reduced symptoms, improved quality of life, and decreased frequency of hospitalizations, in patients with COPD. Addition of pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for patients with COPD and moderate to severe symptoms (e.g., having to walk more slowly than others of same age due to breathlessness, having to stop to catch breath when walking on level ground at own pace, or having more severe breathlessness) and for patients experiencing at least one COPD exacerbation per year, particularly in those recently hospitalized after an exacerbation. This patient meets the criteria for pulmonary rehabilitation."
