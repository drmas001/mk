Continuous glucose monitoring devices should be used as close to daily as possible to maximize benefit. Time in the therapeutic range is associated with reduced risk of microvascular complications. Continuous glucose monitoring devices provide data regarding the time in range, as well as the times below and above target, which are useful parameters for reevaluation of the treatment regimen."
