"). A randomized controlled study of euvolemic critically ill patients confirmed the benefit of a more cautious transfusion trigger, with a hemoglobin level less than 7 g/dL (70 g/L), compared with a more liberal trigger of 9 g/dL (90 g/L). Patients with the lower transfusion trigger had improved 30-day mortality and a lower rate of complications, such as pulmonary edema or acute myocardial infarction. A subgroup of patients with active ischemic heart disease did better with the more liberal transfusion strategy. Guidelines support these findings, strongly recommending a restrictive erythrocyte transfusion threshold in which transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL (70 g/L) for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 to 12 g/dL (100-120 g/L) (",

"). Guidelines recommend that erythropoietin-stimulating agents be withheld in patients with CKD not requiring dialysis who have a hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dL (100 g/L). Higher hemoglobin targets are associated with adverse events, including worsening hypertension and volume overload. This patient has an acute worsening of mild, asymptomatic anemia, most likely because of sepsis (inflammation) and dilution owing to fluid resuscitation, which should improve as he continues to recover from his current illness. No evidence supports any benefit to erythropoietin therapy in this setting."
