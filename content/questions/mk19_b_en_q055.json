"). This patient has symptoms compatible with fasting hypoglycemia, which is rare without diabetes mellitus and thus requires careful investigation. Causes include medications, alcohol, kidney or liver dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and, rarely, pancreatogenous insulinoma or noninsulinoma (endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia that is not caused by an insulinoma). If the hypoglycemia occurs while fasting, a prolonged fast, up to 72 hours, should be initiated. Plasma glucose should be drawn every 6 hours and sent to the laboratory immediately. If the level is less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L), four tests should be sent: C-peptide, insulin, proinsulin, and β-hydroxybutyrate. Insulin antibodies and an oral hypoglycemic agent screen should also be measured at the beginning of the fast. Blood sample collection should increase to every 1 to 2 hours when the glucose measurement is less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Testing is complete when one of the following two sets of parameters is met: plasma glucose 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) or less with neuroglycopenia (neurologic symptoms, most commonly confusion), or plasma glucose less than 55 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) with previously documented Whipple triad, defined as plasma glucose less than 55 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L), neuroglycopenic symptoms, and resolution of symptoms with glucose ingestion. Point-of-care glucose values and hyperadrenergic symptoms (palpitations, diaphoresis, headache, tremor, pallor) should not be used to determine the end of the fast. Blood samples should be collected again at the end of the 72-hour period if none of the complete testing criteria has been met."
