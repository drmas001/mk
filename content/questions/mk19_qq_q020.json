"). This patient most likely has upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), the most common cause of chronic cough (>8 weeks' duration). Other common causes of chronic cough include asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), ACE inhibitors, and smoking. UACS was previously known as postnasal drip syndrome, but the name was revised to include other etiologies that cause excess upper airway secretions. Symptoms of UACS include cough, nasal discharge, sensation of postnasal drip, or frequent throat clearing, although symptoms other than cough are not always present. The oropharyngeal examination in UACS may reveal cobblestoning of the posterior pharynx or visible mucopurulent secretions draining from the nasopharynx. Allergic rhinitisâ€“associated UACS is optimally treated with intranasal glucocorticoids, whereas UACS resulting from nonallergic rhinitis responds best to first-generation antihistamines (chlorpheniramine, brompheniramine, diphenhydramine) and decongestants (pseudoephedrine)."
