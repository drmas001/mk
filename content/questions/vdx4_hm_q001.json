"The most likely diagnosis is protein C deficiency or resistance. Protein C is a vitamin K–dependent protein that degrades activated factors V and VIII and has an anticoagulant effect. Many persons with protein C deficiency will experience a thrombotic event or pregnancy morbidity before 50 years of age and have a strong family history of thrombosis. The half-life of protein C is shorter than many of the other vitamin K–dependent proteins. When warfarin is initiated in patients with protein C deficiency, warfarin-induced thrombotic skin necrosis can result from rapid depletion of protein C with a subsequent transient hypercoagulable state following the loss of its anticoagulant effect."
