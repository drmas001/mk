"). This patient had significant upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage related to peptic ulcer disease. He was appropriately initiated on an intravenous proton pump inhibitor, anticoagulation with warfarin was withheld, and endoscopic therapy was performed. In patients with significant bleeding and an INR less than 2.5, guidelines recommend not delaying endoscopy. Few prospective data are available to guide optimal timing of resuming anticoagulation after gastrointestinal bleeding. In general, if hemostasis is certain, anticoagulants should be restarted as soon as possible because the outcome of a thrombotic event is usually far worse than recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Retrospective data suggest that resuming anticoagulation (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) within the first week minimizes risk for 90-day thrombosis, without increasing risk for 90-day recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding."
