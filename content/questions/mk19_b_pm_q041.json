"). This patient has anaphylaxis from a Hymenoptera sting. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction caused by acute mediator release into the circulation, usually triggered by IgE-linked immunologic responses to specific foods, medications, insect venom, latex, or other antigens but sometimes occurring without an allergic trigger. The mediator release results in various clinical manifestations, including pruritus, hypotension, tachycardia, and airway compromise with bronchoconstriction. Initial treatment of anaphylaxis is with epinephrine, which may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously. Mechanisms of action of epinephrine include vasoconstriction, respiratory smooth muscle relaxation, and stabilization of degranulating inflammatory cells. Some patients, such as this one, require repeat doses of epinephrine or even an intravenous epinephrine infusion if anaphylaxis persists. Patients should be given supplemental oxygen and watched closely for signs of airway compromise, such as stridor or obstruction due to a swollen tongue, which may require intubation to maintain airway patency. Patients often require fluid resuscitation, with or without vasopressor therapy. Factors that increase risk for biphasic anaphylaxis (anaphylaxis occurring 1-72 hours after resolution of the initial episode) include a severe initial episode and a need for more than one dose of epinephrine. When such risk exists, or when there is risk of anaphylaxis fatality due to coexisting cardiovascular disease or lack of access to epinephrine or emergency services, extended observation of up to 6 hours or longer may be warranted."
