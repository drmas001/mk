"). The patient sustained a high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) and has no evidence of extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis. Two trials examined the role of aspirin combined with clopidogrel versus monotherapy (with either aspirin or clopidogrel) in TIA and minor stroke initiated within 12 to 24 hours from onset. The studies used either 21 or 90 days of aspirin and clopidogrel versus single antiplatelet agents and, overall, demonstrated a small but significant reduction in risk of recurrence at 90 days for the combination therapy. The American Heart Association Guidelines endorse a treatment duration of 21 days. The risk of hemorrhagic complications appeared to increase beyond 30 days; duration between 30 to 90 days of aspirin and clopidogrel in minor stroke or TIA is commonly used in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis as the underlying stroke cause. Following that time, clopidogrel is discontinued, and aspirin therapy is maintained."
