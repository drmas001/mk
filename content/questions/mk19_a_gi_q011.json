"). HAV is transmitted by the fecalâ€“oral route and causes a self-limited illness. Risk factors for transmission include international travel, contact with household members with HAV infection, men who have sex with men, homelessness, and exposure to day care or institutionalized settings. HAV incidence declined dramatically after introduction of universal childhood HAV vaccination, but rates have recently increased among unvaccinated people, especially those reporting homelessness or drug use. This unvaccinated patient has been exposed to a roommate with acute HAV infection and so is at risk for infection. Persons who have recently been exposed to HAV and have not been immunized should receive postexposure prophylaxis, consisting of the HAV vaccine, as soon as possible after exposure, preferably within 2 weeks. The HAV vaccine is recommended for prophylaxis in persons aged 12 months or older. For long-term immunity, the HAV vaccine series should be completed with a second dose at least 6 months after the first dose; however, the second dose is not necessary for postexposure prophylaxis."

Combined therapy (administered at different sites) is a consideration because of the limited vaccine efficacy in this age group and the greater severity of illness in older adults. HAV immune globulin may also be administered to persons at high risk for complications, including those with chronic liver disease and immunosuppression. Because this young patient does not have these risk factors, HAV immune globulin is not necessary."
