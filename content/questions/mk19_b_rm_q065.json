"). Inclusion body myositis is an insidious condition affecting older adults. It is distinguishable from other forms of myositis by its slow progression and different pattern of muscle involvement. Both proximal and distal muscle involvement occur; finger and forearm flexor involvement is nearly pathognomonic. Up to half of patients with inclusion body myositis have cricopharyngeal muscle involvement, leading to dysphagia and increased risk for aspiration. Serum creatine kinase levels are elevated to a lesser extent than seen in other forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Autoantibodies are less often present, but anti-NT5c1A autoantibodies are found in up to half of patients and rarely in healthy persons. Patients with inclusion body myositis, unlike those with other forms of idiopathic myositis, often have little improvement while receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Therapeutic trials should not be continued if they are not effective. Physical therapy may help patients to maintain muscle function for activities of daily living."
