"), which are brown, scaly, round or oval waxy papules and plaques that commonly occur in older persons. Early lesions appear as a flat, light tan macule. As the lesion matures, it assumes a darker color and thickens to form a plaque. At this stage, they frequently have a “stuck-on” appearance and often have verrucous (warty) features. On the back they may assume a “Christmas tree” pattern, following skin cleavage lines. They most commonly appear on the face, trunk, and upper extremities. Seborrheic keratoses typically exhibit horn cysts (epidermal cysts filled with keratin) on the surface that can best be visualized with a magnifying lens. Although benign, they may occasionally resemble melanoma because of the presence of asymmetry, an irregular border, irregular pigmentation, large size, and progressive enlargement. Atypical lesions are often biopsied to rule out malignancy. No treatment is required; irritated lesions may be removed with cryotherapy or electrodessication and curettage. The appearance of new lesions is common, particularly with advancing age. Seborrheic keratoses are not usually associated with any other medical condition. The sign of Lester-Trélat is the sudden eruption, usually over 3 to 6 months, of numerous seborrheic keratoses, usually on an inflammatory base, and is associated with an internal malignancy."
