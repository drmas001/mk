"). This patient has a degenerative meniscal tear. Such tears are common in older individuals and can be a common source of knee pain in this patient population. The diagnosis can be made by the history and physical examination findings. Degenerative meniscal tears are associated with diffuse or medial knee pain; catching, locking, or inability to extend the knee; and pain with flexion activities, such as squatting. The McMurray test for meniscal tear is performed by having the patient lay supine, flexing the knee fully, and externally rotating the tibia. The examiner's hand is over the medial joint line. The test is repeated with the tibia internally rotated. The test result is positive when snapping is detected over the joint line with extension of the knee. The Thessaly test for meniscal tear is performed by holding the patient's outstretched hands while the patient stands on the uninjured leg with the knee flexed to 5 degrees; the other knee is flexed with the foot off the floor. The patient rotates the body internally and externally on the knee three times. The test is repeated with the knee flexed to 20 degrees. This process is repeated with the injured knee. Pain in the joint line is a positive test result. A growing body of evidence supports managing degenerative meniscal tears conservatively with physical therapy and strengthening of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles."
