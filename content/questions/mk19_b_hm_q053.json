"). This patient has Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), an IgM monoclonal gammopathy and the clinicopathologic manifestation of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The disease may be indolent and asymptomatic, or it may be associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, sweats, and weight loss. The IgM monoclonal protein is quite large and usually does not cause severe damage to the kidney, but kidney disease is found in approximately 3% of patients. Tissue infiltration leads to hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Increased serum viscosity from the circulating IgM can lead to hyperviscosity syndrome, found in approximately 30% of patients with WM. Although viscosity measurement can establish the diagnosis of hyperviscosity syndrome, treatment should be initiated based on the patient's symptoms and findings. Hyperviscosity syndrome has various manifestations such as headache, altered mental status, change in vision and hearing, nystagmus, and ataxia. Funduscopic evaluation may reveal dilated retinal veins, papilledema, and flame hemorrhages. Mucosal bleeding and petechiae are related to platelet dysfunction and dysfibrinogenemia. Symptomatic patients with hyperviscosity syndrome require urgent treatment with plasmapheresis, which efficiently removes the IgM paraprotein and reduces serum viscosity with symptom improvement. The underlying disease process requires chemotherapy directed against the malignant cells."
