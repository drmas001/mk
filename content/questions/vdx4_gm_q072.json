"The most likely diagnosis is tinea pedis. The chronic form of tinea pedis may present with silvery scale and dull erythema of the entire foot or with more localized annular erythematous and scaly patches. It can be accompanied by interdigital scaling and maceration or by blisters of the plantar arch, sides of the feet, and/or heel. It may itch or may be entirely asymptomatic. Tinea pedis can have a more acute form with 1- to 2-mm vesicles and can be extremely pruritic. In the two feetâ€“one hand syndrome (as in this patient), one hand has a diffuse scaly appearance that is also fungal in nature; in this syndrome, tinea pedis typically precedes tinea manuum."
