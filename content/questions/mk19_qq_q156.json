"). Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder. This type of tremor is often noted in outstretched arm position and with activities, such as writing or use of utensils, but is absent at rest. Tremor can involve other parts of the body, including the head and vocal cords. Tremor characteristically improves with ethanol use. There is often, although not universally, a positive family history. This patient's otherwise normal neurologic examination rules out alternative diagnoses such as Parkinson disease or dystonia. Assessment of any form of action tremor should include thyroid and renal function studies, liver chemistries, serum electrolytes, and a review of medications. Patients younger than 40 years should undergo screening for Wilson disease with serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper measurements. First-line therapies for essential tremor are propranolol and primidone. In severe medication-refractory essential tremor, neurosurgical treatments can be helpful."

") is a low-amplitude action tremor that is often associated with medications, stress, caffeine, or other triggers. This tremor often has an intermittent or fluctuating course and resolves with removal of underlying triggers. There is no indication of typical stressors in this patient, and she is not on any medications. Additionally, presence of head tremor, tremulous voice, and improvement of tremor with ethanol are features of essential tremor and are not typical for enhanced physiologic tremor."

") is an extrapyramidal complication of dopamine receptor–blocking medications (e.g., first- or second-generation antipsychotic drugs, metoclopramide). It is associated with characteristic choreiform and dystonic craniofacial movements, which often involve other body parts, such as the neck and trunk. Other movements, such as tremor, myoclonus, and akathisia (restlessness), can also be part of a tardive syndrome. Treatment involves removal of the offending medication. This patient does not manifest either choreiform or dystonic movements and is not taking any medications, making the diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia unlikely."
