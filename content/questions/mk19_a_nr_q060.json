The patient's neurologic status has not changed since she received treatment, but she should continue to have neurologic checks and blood pressure monitoring once every hour for the first 24 hours. Any change in neurologic status should prompt repeat imaging to ensure that there is not symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, which would also require reversal. Oral medications can be considered after a formal dysphagia evaluation to minimize the risk of aspiration pneumonia."
