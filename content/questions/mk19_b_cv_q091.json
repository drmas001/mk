"). When patients have an indication for cardiac surgery (such as coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) and have concomitant aortic stenosis and thoracic aortic aneurysm, the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement and aortic repair should be considered. Aortic repair should be performed at the time of cardiac surgery if the ascending aorta or aortic root is larger than 4.5 cm. In this patient with a maximal aortic dimension of 5.6 cm, the annual risk for rupture of the thoracic aorta is significant enough to refer her for aortic repair. The additional risk associated with aortic valve replacement during CABG is small, and replacement now would prevent subsequent aortic valve operations for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis."
