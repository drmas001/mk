"), and the thyroid function tests should be repeated in 2 to 4 weeks. Pregnancy is known to increase levothyroxine requirements in most patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy, and this expected increase should be anticipated by increasing her levothyroxine dosage. The levothyroxine dosage is typically increased in the first (and sometimes in the second) trimester of pregnancy, with a possible total increase of 30% to 50%. During pregnancy, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be maintained in the lower half of the trimester-specific reference range, or less than 2.5 µU/mL (2.5 mU/L) if trimester-specific reference ranges are unavailable. In contrast, the upper range of normal for nonpregnant patients is approximately 4.5 to 5.0 µU/mL (4.5-5.0 mU/L)."

") will result in maternal hypothyroidism during the first trimester and places the fetus at substantial risk. The fetus is dependent on transplacental transfer of maternal thyroid hormones during the first 12 weeks of gestation. The presence of maternal subclinical or overt hypothyroidism may be associated with subsequent fetal neurocognitive impairment, increased risk for premature birth, low birth weight, increased miscarriage rate, and even an increased risk for fetal death. In pregnant women with hypothyroidism, thyroid function testing should be frequent, preferably every 4 weeks, to protect the health of mother and fetus and to avoid pregnancy complications. When serum TSH values are inappropriately elevated, the dosage of levothyroxine is increased, and free thyroxine and TSH levels are monitored every 2 to 4 weeks."
