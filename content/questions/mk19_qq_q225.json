") is indicated for this patient with renovascular hypertension secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia. There are two types of renovascular disease: (1) atherosclerotic renovascular disease and (2) fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease usually occurs in patients aged older than 45 to 55 years, especially in those with diffuse atherosclerosis, but it also can be isolated to the kidney. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic disorder that affects the mid and distal portions of the renal artery and usually occurs in young to middle-aged persons, particularly women (90%). Renovascular hypertension due to fibromuscular dysplasia is most commonly caused by medial fibroplasia of the renal artery. On angiography, the characteristic finding of fibromuscular dysplasia is the \"string of beads\" appearance of the involved artery. Hypertension usually affects patients between 15 and 30 years of age. Catheter-based renal angiography is the most accurate method to diagnose this condition. This study is indicated for patients whose clinical presentation raises strong suspicion for fibromuscular disease–related hypertension, such as those with severe resistant hypertension and high plasma renin activity. Revascularization with renal angioplasty may be performed at the same time as diagnostic angiography. The young age of many patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, such as this 32-year-old woman, reduces the risk for complications from this procedure."
