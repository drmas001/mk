"A 77-year-old man is seen for a preoperative medical evaluation before elective aortofemoral bypass. He has exercise-limiting claudication despite participation in supervised exercise programs and pharmacologic intervention. Medical history is also significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and aortic stenosis. His last echocardiogram 2 years ago showed moderate aortic stenosis with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Medications are atorvastatin, aspirin, metoprolol, benazepril, amlodipine, metformin, liraglutide, and cilostazol."

"). The 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease recommends that when valvular heart disease is diagnosed in patients being considered for elective noncardiac surgery, the first step is to review the standard criteria for intervention of the specific valve lesion. If the patient meets standard criteria for intervention, it is prudent to defer the elective noncardiac procedure and proceed to valve intervention instead. In patients with significant asymptomatic valve disease who do not meet standard criteria for intervention, the risk of the noncardiac procedure can be minimized by 1) having an accurate diagnosis of the type and severity of valve dysfunction, 2) choosing an anesthetic approach appropriate to the valve lesion, and 3) ensuring a higher level of intraoperative monitoring."

This patient has no indication for percutaneous aortic balloon valvulotomy."
