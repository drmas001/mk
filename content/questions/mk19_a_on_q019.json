"). Depressive symptoms are frequently encountered in patients with chronic medical disease either as a result of the illness itself (such as hypothyroidism) or as a response to the disability caused by the illness. Depression commonly accompanies many medical conditions, including cancer, neurologic diseases (Parkinson disease), heart failure, and HIV infection. Medications, including tamoxifen, glucocorticoids, and interferon, may also trigger depressive symptoms. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, and other antidepressants such as bupropion, are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 and may interact with tamoxifen, reducing tamoxifen activation. The impact of this interaction on long-term breast cancer outcomes is unknown, but use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors is generally not recommended, and other SSRIs, such as sertraline or escitalopram, or venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, are felt to be safe and are preferred. Breast cancer survivors, particularly those diagnosed at young ages, are at increased risk of anxiety and depression, and evaluating and managing mood symptoms is an important aspect of survivorship care."

") may cause mood symptoms such as depression, but given the associated improvement in breast cancer outcomes and survival, tamoxifen should not be discontinued in this patient. Mood symptoms could be managed with the addition of an antidepressant. If the patient has depression that persists despite incorporation of antidepressants and/or counseling, it would be reasonable to consider alternatives. In a premenopausal woman, this treatment would include use of ovarian suppression with an aromatase inhibitor, although these medications may also contribute to mood symptoms."
