Results of allergy skin testing, rhinoscopy, CT of the sinuses and chest, spirometry, ambulatory pH monitoring, and sputum testing have been normal. She currently takes no medications."

") is the most appropriate additional treatment for this patient's cough. Unexplained chronic cough is characterized by persistent cough symptoms with no identifiable cause after comprehensive evaluation. A multimodality speech pathology intervention has been shown to reduce cough frequency, improve cough severity, and have a beneficial effect on cough-related quality of life in patients with unexplained chronic cough. The intervention typically consists of two to four sessions of education, cough suppression techniques, breathing exercises, and counseling. It is recommended by the CHEST guideline and expert panel report on the treatment of unexplained chronic cough. Gabapentin is a neuromodulatory agent that may dampen the enhanced neural sensitization that is a key component of unexplained cough. Although it is not FDA approved for this indication, gabapentin can be an effective treatment for unexplained chronic cough. Gabapentin carries significant risk for adverse effects, including dizziness, disequilibrium, somnolence, weight gain, peripheral edema, and cognitive difficulties. In this patient who is younger than 65 years and otherwise healthy, a therapeutic trial of gabapentin is reasonable if the potential harms and benefits are acceptable to the patient. After 6 months of treatment, harms and benefits should be reassessed before continuing gabapentin."
