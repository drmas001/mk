") is indicated. This would be appropriate for patients with stages I, II, or III anal cancer. Anal cancer is a squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the more common cancer of the rectum is an adenocarcinoma derived from the columnar epithelium of the rectum. Anal cancers are a human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated tumor and are of squamous cell histology. Rectal adenocarcinomas are not HPV-related. Risk of anal cancer is increased in men who have sex with men and in patients with HIV infection, history of condylomata, and kidney or liver transplantation. Presenting symptoms of anal cancer may include bleeding, pain, or pruritus; however, 25% of patients present without any anorectal symptoms. Although no formal recommendations address screening for anal dysplasia in at-risk populations, screening modalities to consider include digital rectal examination, anal Pap test, HPV testing, and high-resolution anoscopy. Mitomycin plus a fluoropyrimidine (now most commonly oral capecitabine, although some centers still use intravenous fluorouracil) is the standard chemotherapy regimen used concurrently with radiation therapy in patients with anal cancer."

Therefore, surgery is reserved for when other reasonable options have been exhausted."
