") with subsequent revascularization. CLTI is characterized by more than 2 weeks of ischemic rest pain, nonhealing wound/ulcers, or gangrene in one or both legs that is attributable to objectively proven peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD can be confirmed with ankle-brachial index testing (often <0.4 in CLTI), toe-brachial index testing, and other measures. Unlike patients with other symptoms of PAD (e.g., intermittent claudication), patients with CLTI often cannot exercise because of skin ulceration and/or ischemic rest pain. The primary goal for patients with CLTI is to revascularize the limb to reduce the incidence of major amputation, and invasive angiography expedites the diagnosis and allows for concurrent endovascular revascularization. In patients who undergo successful limb revascularization, the 1-year risk for major amputation is significantly lower than in patients who do not undergo revascularization."
