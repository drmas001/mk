") is the most appropriate next test. The evaluation of angina should include a physical examination to detect conditions that may mimic symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as a focused history to assist in determining the pretest probability of CAD. A resting ECG is required to evaluate for ongoing ischemic insult and to guide the choice of subsequent diagnostic testing. This 66-year-old woman with clinical features of possible angina has an intermediate pretest likelihood of CAD, an indication for stress test diagnostic evaluation. In addition to its role as a first-line test in the evaluation of possible CAD, stress testing with imaging is indicated in patients with an inability to exercise, baseline ECG abnormalities (such as left bundle branch block [LBBB]) that limit interpretation of the exercise ECG, or indeterminate findings on the exercise ECG. In patients able to exercise but with underlying LBBB, such as this patient, pharmacologic stress testing with imaging (myocardial perfusion, cardiac magnetic resonance, or echocardiographic) is appropriate to reduce the rate of false-positive test results associated with exercise ECG (",
