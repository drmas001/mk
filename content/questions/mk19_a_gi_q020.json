"). Categories of the extent of ulcerative colitis include proctitis (within 18 cm of the anal verge, distal to the rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis (extending from the sigmoid to the splenic flexure), and extensive colitis (beyond the splenic flexure). This patient has findings consistent with mild ulcerative proctitis. Three factors must be considered in choosing therapy for ulcerative colitis: disease severity, distribution of disease, and previous therapies, including response and adherence. 5-ASAs are anti-inflammatory medications and the mainstay of treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Patients with proctitis should receive topical therapy with 5-ASA suppositories. Patients with left-sided colitis should receive topical therapy with 5-ASA enemas. In mild to moderate left-sided or extensive ulcerative colitis, combined 5-ASA therapy (oral and topical) is superior for inducing remission compared with oral or topical therapies alone. Once remission is achieved, 5-ASAs are effective in maintaining it."
