"). Routine screening for cervical cancer can be discontinued at age 65 years in non–high-risk women, provided that the patient has undergone adequate prior screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) defines adequate prior screening as three consecutive negative cytology results or two consecutive negative cytology tests plus negative HPV test results within the past 10 years, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years. Recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) are similar and state that screening can be discontinued at age 65 years in patients who have appropriate negative screening in the preceding 10 years and who do not have a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more significant disease in the preceding past 25 years. Women older than 65 years who have never been screened or in whom the adequacy of prior screening cannot be confirmed, such as this patient, should undergo screening. There is up to a 74% mortality reduction from cervical cancer in women who have never been screened. Currently, two FDA-approved primary HPV tests are available for cervical cancer screening, and both are approved as standalone cervical screening tests beginning at age 25 years. Five HPV tests are FDA-approved for co-testing (HPV testing plus cytology). The USPSTF recommends screening with cytology every 3 years, primary high-risk HPV testing every 5 years, or co-testing every 5 years. The ACS favors primary HPV testing every 5 years. When primary HPV testing is unavailable, the ACS recommends HPV co-testing every 5 years or, alternatively, cytology alone every 3 years."
