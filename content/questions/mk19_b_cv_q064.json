") is the most appropriate additional management. This patient presents with clinical signs of a pacemaker pocket infection, possibly due to skin contamination from a superficial wound. Although infections most commonly are seen shortly after pocket instrumentation (e.g., following initial implantation or generator change), they may occur spontaneously and may present with only localized pain or erythema over the pocket without systemic signs or symptoms of infection. This patient has relatively clear erythema, scabbing, and dimpling, likely with impending erosion; however, pocket infection may be more insidious and subtle. In the absence of major contraindications to extraction and/or extreme risk factors, curative therapy requires extraction of all implanted cardiac hardware, debridement of the pocket, sustained antibiotic therapy, and reimplantation at a new location after infection has been eradicated. This patient does not have any obvious contraindications to device extraction or extreme risk factors (primarily age and comorbid conditions) that would be prohibitive."

In addition, topical antibiotics often worsen the clinical situation, as they may improve the appearance of the skin and delay definitive care."
