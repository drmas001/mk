A carbohydrate antigen 19-9 measurement was normal. She has no other medical conditions and takes no medications."

"). The clinical presentation of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) varies. Many patients are asymptomatic, whereas others are diagnosed after an evaluation of abnormal laboratory test results demonstrating a cholestatic pattern of liver injury. Symptomatic patients present with fatigue and pruritus. Clinical findings vary as well. Asymptomatic patients may have no findings, and others may have jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and excoriations related to pruritus. PSC is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in approximately 85% of cases. Therefore, all patients with PSC without known IBD should have colonoscopy with biopsies at the time of PSC diagnosis. Common colonoscopy findings in patients with PSC and IBD include mild pancolitis with rectal sparing and backwash ileitis. Because of the higher risk for colon cancer in these patients, surveillance colonoscopy with biopsies is also recommended every 1 to 2 years. Patients with PSC have a 15% lifetime risk for cholangiocarcinoma. Annual or biannual magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and measurement of the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level are recommended for cholangiocarcinoma surveillance. The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is highest in the first 2 years after PSC is diagnosed. There is also an increased risk for gallbladder cancer in PSC, and regular annual screening with ultrasonography is recommended."
