However, the initial management should focus on (1) assessment for structural heart disease and (2) identification of correctable causes of VT, including myocardial ischemia, heart failure, drug effects, anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities."

ICD placement is generally unnecessary in idiopathic VT, owing to the benign prognosis and high efficacy of other therapies."
