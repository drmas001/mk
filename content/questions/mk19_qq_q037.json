"). She has clinical and imaging evidence of cervical radiculopathy and significant progressive weakness in the affected arm that correlates with her disk herniation. Surgical intervention is generally indicated in patients with progressive neurologic symptoms resulting from a defined anatomic abnormality to preserve and avoid permanent loss of function. Most patients with cervical radiculopathy symptoms have pain and sensory symptoms; however, they do not have associated motor symptoms or only have minor motor symptoms. These patients can be offered conservative management with rest, analgesics, and physical therapy and do not need neuroimaging. Seventy-five percent of these patients have symptom improvement with these conservative measures."

"In the absence of progressive motor deficits, a conservative approach, such as analgesics and rest, is indicated because most patients experience improvement in symptoms without more aggressive imaging or intervention. Oral and topical NSAIDs are considered first-line pharmacologic therapy for neck pain. Because of its favorable side-effect profile, acetaminophen is also frequently used, although its effectiveness is not clearly established. Muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine are more effective than placebo for treatment of acute neck pain associated with muscle spasm. Acetaminophen and cyclobenzaprine are not appropriate in the management of weakness caused by radiculopathy (",
