"). Limited evidence suggests that patients at risk for or diagnosed with pressure injuries should be repositioned a minimum of every 2 hours to reduce pressure on jeopardized tissue. It is important to avoid generating shear forces or friction during this procedure. The other element in pressure redistribution is the use of a pressure-reducing support surface. Many different categories of support surfaces are available, and within each category, there are a variety of different products. Head-to-head comparisons of support surfaces are generally lacking, and available evidence is weak. However, high-quality foam mattresses or foam overlays have been shown to reduce the incidence of pressure injury postoperatively. This is the basis for recommending foam mattresses or overlays for medical inpatients and others at risk. Foam mattresses and overlays have the advantages of availability and relatively low cost."

Failure of healing may be the primary manifestation of infection in some patients. Fever and leukocytosis are typically absent. This patient does have some nonblanching erythema around the ulcers, but this alone does not indicate infection or need for antibiotics. Empiric treatment with imipenem and vancomycin would be indicted in patients with severe cellulitis and deep soft tissue infection or with sepsis."
