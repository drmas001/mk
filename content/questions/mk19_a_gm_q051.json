There is no erythema or fluctuance in the surrounding tissue and no purulent drainage. The remainder of the examination is normal."

") is the most appropriate treatment. Pressure injuries (also known as pressure ulcers) are localized injuries to the skin or soft tissue caused by pressure and shear forces. They may be classified by use of a staging system, with each stage distinguished by the amount of tissue loss. This patient has a stage 3 pressure injury characterized by full-thickness tissue loss with visible subcutaneous fat but no exposed bone, tendon, or muscle. Treatment of established pressure injuries requires a multipronged management strategy that may include managing the causative conditions; wound protection; surgical debridement and repair; and, in some cases, vacuum-assisted closure. Appropriate treatment for this patient includes use of an air-fluidized mattress (or an advanced static mattress), local wound care with hydrocolloid dressings, and pressure offloading."

"), do not have a role in managing pressure injuries without signs of infection, and this patient has no evidence of infection, such as fever, purulent drainage from the wound, or surrounding erythema. In patients who develop abscesses associated with pressure injury, drainage is necessary. Osteomyelitis can develop from advancing pressure injuries and often requires surgical debridement. Deep intraoperative bone cultures guide the choice of antibiotic therapy in that situation."
