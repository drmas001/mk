"), performing CABG surgery as the initial revascularization strategy in patients with a clear indication is associated with improved outcomes, including reduced rates of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The FREEDOM trial evaluating management of multivessel coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes mellitus showed that the composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke was significantly lower in patients treated with CABG versus PCI. This difference was driven by a statistically significant reduction in the occurrence of death and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing CABG surgery, although stroke rates were higher in the CABG group than the PCI group. CABG is recommended for patients who have left main disease, triple vessel disease, and reduced systolic function, or multivessel disease with involvement of the proximal left anterior descending artery in the presence of diabetes."

"Nitrates improve myocardial oxygen delivery through coronary vasodilation and reduce oxygen demand by reducing preload, thereby reducing ventricular wall stress. The beneficial effects may be offset by reflex tachycardia unless combined with β-blockers or CCBs. Short-acting sublingual nitrates should be prescribed for acute relief of angina. Long-acting nitrates, including isosorbide mononitrate (",
