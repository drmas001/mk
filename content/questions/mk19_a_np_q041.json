One year ago, he had an episode of gross hematuria after running a half marathon. Evaluation at that time resulted in a biopsy diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications."

"). This patient can be reassured that the gross hematuria is related to his underlying IgA nephropathy and will resolve spontaneously. Recurrent gross hematuria, in which the hematuria occurs in the setting of an upper respiratory infection (synpharyngitic hematuria) or after heavy exertion, is a common manifestation of IgA nephropathy in younger patients; it usually portends a benign clinical course with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria without progression to chronic kidney disease. Other predictors of a benign prognosis include a normal serum creatinine concentration and blood pressure as well as minimal proteinuria."

"), is unnecessary in a mild form of nonprogressive IgA nephropathy. The use of immunosuppression in progressive IgA nephropathy remains controversial: The STOP-IgAN study showed no benefit of glucocorticoid therapy in slowing the decline of kidney function, and the TESTING study was terminated early due to significantly increased risk for adverse events in patients treated with glucocorticoids. Therefore, glucocorticoid therapy is reserved for severe forms of IgA nephropathy deemed high risk for rapid progression to end-stage kidney disease."
