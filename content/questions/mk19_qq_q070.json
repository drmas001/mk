"), such as diltiazem or nifedipine. Anal fissures are longitudinal mucosal tears in the anal canal characterized by anorectal pain worsened by bowel movements and sitting. They are common, particularly after episodes of constipation or diarrhea. Pain is the most common symptom, but hematochezia may occur, which sometimes leads to an incorrect diagnosis of complicated hemorrhoids. The disease is confirmed by the presence of a fissure on anorectal inspection; the fissure is typically located posteriorly in the anal canal. Lateral and/or multiple fissures may be seen in association with syphilis, HIV infection, and Crohn disease. Acute anal fissures generally resolve within a few weeks with the use of sitz baths, psyllium, and bulking agents. Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine, and anti-inflammatory agents can be considered to address pain or bleeding, but their use is not required to promote fissure healing. Anal fissures lasting more than 8 to 12 weeks are considered chronic and may be characterized by edema and fibrosis, as well as a sentinel pile (appearing as a skin tag) or hypertrophied anal papilla within the anal canal. Rectal spasm is the major reason for anal fissures becoming chronic and should be treated with either topical calcium channel blockers or nitrates. Topical nitroglycerin use is limited by headaches, a common side effect. Colonoscopy is indicated when additional alarm features are present; these include age older than 45 years, altered bowel habits, anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, unexplained weight loss, and/or family history of colorectal cancer."
