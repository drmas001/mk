"The most likely diagnosis is melasma, also known as chloasma, or “the mask of pregnancy.” Melasma is a commonly acquired condition resulting in patchy hyperpigmentation of the skin on the face. It can also be seen on the upper extremities. Clinically, it presents as ill-defined, tan to dark brown, reticulated patches mostly on the sun-exposed areas of the face (malar, mandibular, and centrofacial regions), and worsens with further sun-exposure."

"hlId":"05d0b4",
"children":[
"In this condition, melanocytes overproduce melanin due to a multitude of factors, including ultraviolet radiation exposure, genetic predisposition, and hormonal influence (pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives). Melasma often fades during the postpartum period, with sun protection, and upon discontinuation of oral contraceptives; however, it may take months to years for pigmentation to normalize. Women and individuals with darker skin types are more commonly predisposed."
