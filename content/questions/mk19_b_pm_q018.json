"A 59-year-old woman is evaluated 5 days after her admission to the hospital for septic shock with no obvious source of infection. She is neutropenic. She has large B-cell lymphoma and received her last course of chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) 5 days before admission. Piperacillin-tazobactam, gentamicin, and vancomycin were initiated. Gentamicin and vancomycin were discontinued 2 days ago following confirmation of negative blood cultures. She is clinically improved and has been afebrile for 24 hours."

Notation of previous infections, resistance patterns, and local antibiograms should guide decisions on the initial regimen, although carbapenems or extended-range penicillin–β-lactamase inhibitors are a reasonable empiric choice for most patients. Most neutropenic fevers have no known source. In situations in which no pathogen is identified, antibiotic discontinuation is largely contingent on two criteria: resolution of fever and improvement of the patient's absolute neutrophil count to more than 500/μL (0.5 × 10",
