"). The most commonly implicated medications with TEN are antiepileptic agents, especially carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin. Minocycline, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, β-lactam antibiotics, pantoprazole, sertraline, NSAIDs (oxicam and acetic acid type), tramadol, and allopurinol are also frequent causes. The treatment of TEN begins with drug cessation and aggressive care in the intensive care unit or burn center. Ophthalmologic and urologic consultations are mandatory if ocular or genital involvement is present, as destructive scarring may occur in these areas. Most deaths result from secondary infection, complications of transcutaneous fluid loss, or respiratory distress. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is often necessary. A low threshold is recommended for performing cultures and initiation of empiric antibiotics, but use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended."

"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and TEN are related clinical syndromes that are characterized by acute epidermal necrosis. The classification of SJS and TEN is determined by the percentage of body surface area with epidermal detachment: SJS involves less than 10%, SJS-TEN overlap involves 10% to 30%, and TEN involves greater than 30%. TEN is almost exclusively caused by medications, whereas SJS is also triggered by vaccines or infection. SJS and TEN occur within 8 weeks of drug initiation. Patients may have flu-like symptoms for 1 to 3 days before skin eruption. Red-purple macules or patches that enlarge and coalesce develop on the trunk and extremities; skin pain is prominent. Vesicles, bullae, and erosions reflect the epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy. Nikolsky sign (the shearing off of the epidermis with lateral pressure on the skin) is present. Two or more mucosal surfaces are involved in more than 80% of patients. Systemic inflammation can result in pneumonia, hepatitis, nephritis, arthralgia, and myocarditis."
