"). This patient is experiencing angioedema, likely triggered by use of the angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) valsartan-sacubitril, and should be intubated immediately because she is at high risk of asphyxiation from upper airway edema. Angioedema (localized subcutaneous or submucosal swelling of face, lips, or upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract) can be mast cell mediated (i.e., histaminergic), as in allergic IgE-mediated reactions to foods, drugs, and insect stings. The absence of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction, such as urticaria, pruritus, bronchospasm, and hypotension, is more typical of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which can be seen with hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, and ARNI or ACE inhibitor use. Although angioedema is most often reported early after starting or increasing the dose of an ARNI or ACE inhibitor, it can occur years later. The risk for recurrence with continued exposure to an ARNI or ACE inhibitor is substantial, and patients should be switched to an alternative medication. Angioedema typically resolves within 2 to 3 days of discontinuation."

Patients with severe angioedema may require nasotracheal intubation."
