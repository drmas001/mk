"). He has systemic signs of infection (fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis) indicating moderate severity nonpurulent cellulitis of the left lower extremity. For moderate severity cellulitis, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends intravenous antibiotics directed against β-hemolytic streptococci, including penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, or clindamycin. Nonpurulent skin infections include erysipelas and cellulitis. Erysipelas refers to infection of the epidermis, upper dermis, and superficial lymphatics. Usually involving the face or lower extremities, this infection is brightly erythematous with distinct, elevated borders and associated fever, lymphangitis, and regional lymphadenopathy. Cellulitis refers to infection involving the deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue. Inflammatory signs of infection are similar to erysipelas, but the area of involvement is less well demarcated. For immunocompetent patients with cellulitis or erysipelas who have no systemic signs or symptoms (i.e., mild infection), oral therapy, including penicillin VK, cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or clindamycin, directed against streptococci is recommended."

"Necrotizing soft tissue infections, which involve subdermal compartments (fascia and possibly muscle) are uncommon but potentially life threatening. Necrotizing fasciitis initially resembles cellulitis before potentially rapid progression with edema, severe pain, hemorrhagic bullous lesions, skin necrosis, and local crepitus. Systemic toxicity manifests with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, mental status changes, and tachypnea. A hallmark of infection is “woody” induration appreciated by palpation of involved subcutaneous tissues. Pending culture results, empiric antibiotic treatment includes broad-spectrum coverage for aerobic and anaerobic organisms (including MRSA) and consists of vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid plus piperacillin-tazobactam (",
