"). Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended in all adults aged 65 years or older and in adults aged 19 to 64 years with certain high-risk conditions. Three pneumococcal vaccines are available: the 15-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV15), the PCV20, and the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). The conjugate vaccines are favored over the PPSV23 as the primary vaccine. This patient received the PPSV23 four years ago because she has chronic kidney disease and is at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. She should additionally receive one of the conjugate vaccines at this time. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination with either PCV15 or PCV20 in eligible patients who were previously vaccinated with PPSV23. In patients without prior vaccination, if PCV15 is used it should be followed by vaccination with PPSV23; this patient has already received PPSV23, so use of PCV15 or PCV20 alone is recommended."
