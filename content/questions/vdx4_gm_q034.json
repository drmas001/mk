"The most likely diagnosis is plantar fasciitis. Diagnosis is based on demonstrating palpable tenderness at the anterior base of the calcaneus (medial calcaneal tubercle), as indicated in the image. The windlass test assesses for pain in the plantar fascia by simulating the motion of a step. With the patient's foot bearing weight, the toes are dorsiflexed by the examiner, maximally stretching the plantar fascia. A windlass test that reproduces the foot pain has a high specificity for plantar fasciitis. A calcaneal stress fracture would be suggested by pain that is more posterior on the calcaneus and which does not improve with walking. Tarsal tunnel syndrome may be associated with a positive Tinel sign with tapping on the tunnel posterior to the medical malleolus."
