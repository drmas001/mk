"The most likely diagnosis is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This patient has distinct yellow-white lesions surrounding the macular area (drusen) and areas of pigment mottling characteristic of dry AMD. AMD is a progressive chronic disease involving the central retina. Patients with early AMD are often asymptomatic, although yellow drusen may be visible underneath retinal pigment epithelium. Patients with atrophic (dry) AMD, which accounts for 80% to 90% of AMD cases, note slowly progressive vision loss over the course of years. About 10% to 20% of patients with atrophic AMD progress to neovascular (wet) AMD, which often presents with more rapid visual loss and may be accompanied by a sudden worsening of central vision associated with straight-line distortion (metamorphopsia), scotoma, or both."
