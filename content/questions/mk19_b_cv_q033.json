"A 68-year-old man is evaluated 1 month after atherectomy and stenting of the right superficial femoral artery for severe claudication. Since the procedure, he can walk and perform all of his customary activities without claudication. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He exercises 150 minutes weekly and consumes a heart-healthy diet. He quit smoking 15 years ago. Medications are low-dose aspirin, low-dose rivaroxaban, metoprolol, ramipril, and high-intensity rosuvastatin."

"). Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are less likely to receive guideline-directed medical therapy than are patients with other forms of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone (75-325 mg/d) or clopidogrel alone (75 mg/d) is recommended to reduce myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and vascular death in patients with symptomatic PAD. Treatment with a statin is indicated for all patients with PAD. Antihypertensive therapy should be administered to patients with hypertension and PAD to reduce the risk for MI, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. Patients with PAD who smoke cigarettes or use other forms of tobacco should be advised at every visit to quit. Although not guideline recommended, the combination of low-dose rivaroxaban plus low-dose aspirin in patients with PAD may reduce cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke compared with aspirin alone. This patient is receiving appropriate management for PAD, and no additional treatment is recommended at this time."

In the EUCLID study of 13,885 patients with lower extremity PAD, monotherapy with ticagrelor had very similar effectiveness and safety outcomes to clopidogrel. The use of ticagrelor in this setting, when added to aspirin, has not been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk."
