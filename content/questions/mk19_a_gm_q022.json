"A 58-year-old woman is evaluated in the emergency department within 1 hour of syncope that occurred while she was waiting in the grocery checkout line. She experienced a sensation of warmth and lightheadedness before the event. She did not have chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. She reports no trauma. She recovered quickly and recalls the episode. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, rosuvastatin, and metformin."

"). The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society concluded that the history and physical examination are the most important tools in stratifying risk in patients with syncope. All additional testing can be based on this initial evaluation. Important aspects to obtain in the history include the presence of reversible factors, the situation in which the syncopal event occurred, and any symptoms present before and after the syncopal event. A thorough medical history and medication history should be obtained, with an emphasis on history of cardiac disease. A family history also should be obtained, focusing on any history of syncope or sudden unexplained death, including drowning. Physical examination should include a thorough cardiovascular examination, with orthostatic blood pressure measurement in three positions and cardiac auscultation. A basic neurologic examination should also be performed. ECG should be included in the initial evaluation of syncope as a tool to identify potentially life-threatening causes of cardiac syncope."
