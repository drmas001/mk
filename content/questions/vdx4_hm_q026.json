"The most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. Koilonychia (spoon nails) is a finding associated with iron deficiency anemia and other microcytic anemias. The natural nail convexity is replaced by concave nails. This finding is now rarely seen because of the widespread use of automated blood counts that identify most patients with anemia before it becomes chronic and severe. This condition has also been associated with rheumatic fever, lichen planus, and syphilis."
