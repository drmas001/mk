"). This patient meets the diagnostic criteria defining acute pericarditis, with pericarditic chest pain, a friction rub on examination, ECG changes consistent with acute pericarditis, and a pericardial effusion. Most patients with acute pericarditis can be managed as outpatients; however, those with accompanying high-risk features may require hospitalization for treatment and monitoring. Patients with pericarditis and high-risk features, including temperature higher than 38.0 °C (100.4 °F), subacute onset, a large pericardial effusion or tamponade at presentation, oral anticoagulation therapy, or lack of response to treatment, may require hospitalization. This patient has a pericardial effusion smaller than the size connoting high risk (diastolic echo-free space, 2 cm), and she does not have clinical or echocardiographic features of tamponade. However, she does have two high-risk features: subacute onset over the course of a week and fever greater than 38.0 °C (100.4 °F). Because of these features, hospitalization to initiate therapy and evaluate early response is indicated. First-line therapy for acute idiopathic pericarditis is aspirin or NSAIDs. Colchicine is recommended as adjunctive therapy to shorten symptom duration and reduce treatment failure and recurrence. Patients who respond to therapy initially but develop recurrent pericarditis after treatment completion may benefit from a longer course of standard therapy with slow tapering, or from interleukin-1 signaling blockade with rilonacept."
