One week before hospitalization, pain in multiple joints of the hands, wrists, elbows, ankles, and feet developed over a 24-hour period. Five days before hospitalization, fever, malaise, and intensification of the joint pain developed. Two days before hospitalization, a rash appeared on the extremities and trunk and spread to the face. He lives in southern Florida and has not recently traveled outside the United States."

") is the most likely diagnosis. Chikungunya is an arbovirus spread by mosquitoes. Acute infection is heralded by the abrupt onset of severe, polyarticular arthralgia and fever, an exanthema that may be focal or diffuse, and conjunctivitis. The distribution of the arthritis is often bilaterally symmetric and usually involves 10 or more joints. The temperature is often greater than 39.0 째C (102.2 째F), and fever persists for 3 to 5 days. Laboratory testing may reveal leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum aminotransferase and creatinine levels. Chikungunya virus can be detected by polymerase chain reaction for 1 week after onset of symptoms, after which testing becomes unreliable. Specific IgM antibody is detectable in 5 to 10 days after symptom onset and remains positive for up to 2 to 3 months. This patient's intensity of pain, large number of joints involved, high temperature, and residence in an endemic area make chikungunya the most likely diagnosis."

Although the painful articular syndrome is characterized by an abrupt onset of arthralgia and myalgia, it is not associated with fever, is oligoarticular and asymmetric, most frequently involves the joints of the lower extremities, and typically resolves within a day. HIV-associated arthritis, reactive arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis are sometimes seen in patients with HIV infection but do not have an acute onset and are not associated with fever and rash."
