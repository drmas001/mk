") is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient who presents with signs and symptoms of sinus node dysfunction. Common indications for permanent pacemaker implantation include symptomatic bradycardia without reversible cause; permanent atrial fibrillation with symptomatic bradycardia; alternating bundle branch block; and complete heart block, high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block, irrespective of symptoms. This patient is bradycardic at baseline, does not mount a tachycardic response to activity on ambulatory ECG monitoring, and has low energy. There is no threshold that defines an inadequate heart rate response; it is determined by symptoms suggesting that the heart rate is not meeting the patient's physiologic demands. A common challenge among these patients, many of whom are older, is differentiating between age-related decline in physical activity and pathologic, symptomatic sinus node dysfunction. The former is less likely to improve with cardiac pacing, and the latter often improves dramatically. In this case, the patient is very active, with distinct loss of energy and ECG findings of sinus bradycardia. Recent stress test results confirm normal left ventricular function and no ischemia; thus, cardiac pacing is the next appropriate step."
