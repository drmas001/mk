"). Patellofemoral pain syndrome is caused by disordered patellar tracking with knee movement. Risk factors include female sex (due to higher Q-angle in women); patellar instability; weakness of the quadriceps; and physical activities such as climbing stairs, running, and squatting. It is characterized by anterior knee pain and/or stiffness that is worse with knee flexion during weight-bearing activity such as climbing stairs, running, and squatting, but pain is also worse after prolonged flexion with sitting. On physical examination, applying pressure to the patella may reproduce pain. There is also exacerbation of pain with squatting, which has 91% sensitivity as a physical examination sign. NSAIDs may help alleviate symptoms in the acute setting but have not shown benefit in the long term. In the acute phase of injury, modification of activity and cryotherapy (ice, cold water immersion) is recommended. In the recovery phase, the most effective treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome is physical therapy with an exercise program designed to strengthen the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteus muscles. Core strengthening exercises may also have benefit."
