"). There are two major classes of lung cancer: non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Small cell lung cancer typically presents as bulky symptomatic masses with mediastinal involvement. It originates from neuroendocrine cell precursors and is characterized by rapid growth and early metastases. Extrathoracic spread is present in 75% to 80% of patients at initial diagnosis. Symptom onset is rapid (typically <8-12 weeks) and includes cough, wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, and manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes. The most frequent paraneoplastic syndrome is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This syndrome results from production of antidiuretic hormone by malignant cells. Other paraneoplastic syndromes associated with SCLC include Cushing syndrome, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, encephalomyelitis, and sensory neuropathy. This patient has a lung mass with bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hyponatremia (secondary to SIADH), making small cell lung cancer the most likely diagnosis."

Fibrosing mediastinitis usually affects younger patients, slowly progresses over 2 to 5 years, and has calcifications on imaging. Thus, it is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient."
