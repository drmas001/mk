"). The patient presented with increasing dyspnea in the setting of a new unilateral pleural effusion. The presence of heart failure, hepatomegaly and possible ascites, her occupational history, and her history of breast cancer broaden the differential diagnosis. Given the diagnostic uncertainty of the cause of the effusion, it should be sampled. The effusion was bloody in appearance and exudative by all three of Light's criteria (ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein >0.5, ratio of pleural-fluid lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] to serum LDH greater than 0.6, and pleural-fluid LDH greater than two thirds of the upper limit of normal for serum LDH). There are many causes of exudative effusions, but the most common are infection and malignancy. Given her history of breast cancer, the bloody appearance and exudative characteristic of the effusion make it highly suspicious for malignancy. While pleural fluid cytology is pending, it may not be very helpful. The sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology is approximately 60%, and some estimates suggest that it might even be lower (46%) when all types of malignancy are included. The sensitivity is highest for adenocarcinomas (79%) and lowest for mesothelioma (11%). Given the high suspicion of malignancy in this patient, additional testing should be pursued consisting of a repeat thoracentesis with cytology (if the first sample is negative) or thoracoscopic pleural biopsy."
