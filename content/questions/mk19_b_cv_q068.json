") is most appropriate for this patient. Mechanical mitral valve prostheses increase risks to the patient and fetus during pregnancy. Warfarin anticoagulation seems to be the safest agent to prevent maternal prosthetic valve thrombosis; however, warfarin poses increased fetal risks, including teratogenicity, miscarriage, and fetal loss because of intracranial hemorrhage. Risk to the fetus is dose related; warfarin is the preferred anticoagulant during the first trimester if the dosage is 5 mg/d or less. During the second and early third trimesters, warfarin is the preferred anticoagulant."

The effectiveness of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban (anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulants) has not been established in patients with a mechanical heart valve, and the safety of these agents in pregnancy is not known; therefore, they are not recommended."
