"). Constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms, affecting 20% of the general population. Constipation can present with symptoms including infrequent, difficult, or incomplete defecation, and it can be acute or chronic. The patient's history is compatible with chronic constipation. Constipation can be secondary or functional (idiopathic). Medications are the most common cause of secondary constipation. Other causes of this common condition include mechanical obstruction, systemic illnesses, altered physiologic states, and psychosocial conditions. Once secondary causes have been excluded, chronic constipation is considered functional. Functional constipation is subtyped into categories of slow transit, normal transit, or dyssynergic defecation. Slow-transit constipation is defined as the delayed passage of fecal contents through the colon based on objective transit testing. Normal-transit constipation is functional constipation in which colonic transit times are adequate. Dyssynergic defecation refers to difficulty with or inability to expel stool as a result of some combination of abnormalities in contraction and/or relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor during defecation. Colonoscopy is the initial evaluation of constipation in elderly patients with acute constipation and patients with unintentional weight loss, family history of colorectal cancer, unexplained anemia, and age older than 45 years with no previous colonoscopy. This patient is age 52 years, and colonoscopy should be performed as the initial study to evaluate for mechanical causes of constipation."
