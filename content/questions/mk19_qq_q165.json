") is necessary in this patient who has clinical findings consistent with hand osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a chronic progressive multifactorial disorder of maladaptive cellular repair responses to joint stress. It is a clinical diagnosis, and the cardinal symptom is pain with activity that is relieved with rest. Affected patients also typically experience morning stiffness that lasts for less than 30 minutes daily. Bony hypertrophy is commonly detected in the fingers, and Heberden nodes of the distal interphalangeal joints and Bouchard nodes of the proximal interphalangeal joints may be easily palpated. OA also may cause squaring or boxing of the carpometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb. The diagnosis of OA is based on history and physical examination; laboratory testing is not necessary, and radiography is confirmatory but may be unnecessary."

"The most useful laboratory studies to aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are rheumatoid factor and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies. Rheumatoid factor is found in approximately 70% of patients with RA and may be present at the time of disease onset. Because other diseases can be associated with rheumatoid factor, its specificity for RA is somewhat limited. Anti-CCP antibodies are present in 70% of patients with RA but have a specificity of 95%. Anti-CCP antibodies are also more predictive than rheumatoid factor for erosive disease. The key features of RA are swelling and tenderness in and around the metacarpal phalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and wrist joints and prominent morning stiffness lasting more than 1 hour. RA spares the distal interphalangeal joints. Because this patient has no clinical evidence of RA, testing for anti-CCP antibodies (",

These markers of inflammation may help exclude the presence of other inflammatory diseases; however, this patient has no other symptoms, and her presentation is classic for OA, negating the usefulness of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein measurement."
