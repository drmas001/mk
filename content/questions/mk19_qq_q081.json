"-receptor antagonism. Muscular rigidity, altered mental status, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction (hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis) are typically seen. Criteria for the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are based on clinical features, although metabolic acidosis and elevations in serum potassium, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels are common. The mortality rate is 10% to 20%, although the rate is generally higher in patients who develop severe rhabdomyolysis."

") is an inherited skeletal muscle disorder characterized by a hypermetabolic state precipitated by exposure to volatile inhalational anesthetics (halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane) and the depolarizing muscle relaxants succinylcholine and decamethonium. Findings include sustained muscle contractions with skeletal muscle rigidity and masseter muscle spasm, tachycardia, hypercapnia, hypertension, hyperthermia, tachypnea, and cardiac arrhythmias. This patient's history does not include exposure to drugs responsible for malignant hyperthermia, which makes this diagnosis unlikely."

Distinguishing features include shivering, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and ataxia; hyperthermia may be present. This diagnosis is less likely given the presence of muscle rigidity and the fact that the patient was not taking a serotonergic agent."
