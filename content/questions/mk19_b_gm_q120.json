"). This patient likely has porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a photosensitive disorder that presents clinically with scarring and blistering on sun-exposed skin, most commonly the dorsal hands. Hyperpigmentation of the skin and hypertrichosis of the cheeks are also common. The photosensitivity is caused by excess porphyrins deposited in the skin that are sensitive to visible light, particularly the blue-light wavelength. PCT is the most common porphyria and typically presents in patients older than 40 years. Plasma and urine porphyrins should be measured to confirm the diagnosis of PCT to differentiate from pseudoporphyria, which presents similarly clinically but has normal plasma and urine porphyrin levels. Pseudoporphyria is commonly caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tetracyclines, and diuretics. Although skin biopsy can be performed, pathology can be nonspecific and is not necessary. PCT is most commonly associated with hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol-induced liver disease, and hemochromatosis. Testing for other susceptibility factors, such as HIV and hemochromatosis, should also be considered. Treatment for PCT is phlebotomy or twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine."
