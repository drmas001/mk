"). Lateral elbow tendinopathy (previously called lateral epicondylitis), or tennis elbow, is induced by repetitive wrist extension (e.g., prolonged computer use, racquet sports). Symptoms also can be caused by excessive strain on the wrist extensor tendons, as can happen with lifting or carrying a heavy object. Pain is located over the lateral elbow but may also radiate to the dorsal forearm. Tenderness over the lateral elbow and pain with resisted wrist extension are characteristic examination findings. Increasing evidence suggests elbow tendinopathy is a chronic tendinosis with disorganization and neovascularization of the tissues, instead of an acute or chronic inflammatory process as traditionally believed. Because the primary mechanism of injury appears to be mechanical strain, and repetitive use of injured tissues diminishes healing, primary treatment is avoidance of activities that cause pain and continued injury to the affected area. Braces may be useful when exacerbating activities cannot be avoided, and counterforce bracing, which alters the mechanical strain on the elbow tendons, may be helpful. With rest, pain usually subsides, although resistance exercises also may be beneficial. Other conservative measures include ice and topical or oral NSAIDs, which may provide short-term symptomatic relief. Symptoms usually improve over 3 to 4 weeks unless re-injury occurs."

"), may temporarily improve symptoms, but data do not support long-term benefits. Additionally, some evidence shows that glucocorticoid injections may lead to increased risk for recurrence. Associated risks (hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus, infection) must also be considered. Glucocorticoid injections cannot be justified in this patient who has not received an adequate trial of conservative therapy."
