"). The 2019 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Arthritis Foundation (AF) guideline strongly recommends exercise for all patients with osteoarthritis (OA). The most robust evidence supports exercise in the treatment of knee and hip OA; less evidence is available for hand OA. Many helpful exercises are available for knee and hip OA, and the evidence indicates that no one exercise program is superior. However, the best program is likely the one to which the patient will adhere. Walking is the most common form of aerobic exercise evaluated in studies, either on a treadmill or as part of a supervised community program. Strengthening exercises with the use of isokinetic weight machines, resistance exercises, and isometric exercise also provide value. Aquatic exercise often encompasses aspects of aerobic fitness exercises and exercises for enhancing joint range of motion in a low-impact environment. The ACR/AF guideline notes a dose-response relationship of weight loss and resultant symptom and functional improvement in patients with OA who have overweight or obesity. Weight loss attempts coupled with an exercise program increase the benefit to the patient. Even small amounts of weight loss (5%) can have a positive effect on pain and function."
