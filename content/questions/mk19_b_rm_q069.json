"). Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) occurs in roughly 10% of patients with systemic sclerosis and is more prevalent in the limited form (in this patient, evidenced by distal-only skin involvement). PAH is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include anticentromere antibodies, antibodies to U1 ribonucleoprotein, antiphospholipid antibodies, disease duration greater than 6 years, and telangiectasias. TTE provides an estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure and assessment of both right and left heart size and function. Current recommendations based on expert opinion vary, but PAH screening with pulmonary function tests and TTE at baseline and at the time of development of any new signs or symptoms is reasonable. In addition, most experts obtain pulmonary function tests and TTE annually. PAH is typically associated with a D",
