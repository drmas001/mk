"), including surgical aortic dissection repair and aortic valve replacement. Causes of acute aortic regurgitation include endocarditis, blunt trauma to the chest, iatrogenic causes (such as complications of balloon aortic valvuloplasty), and aortic dissection. Patients with acute aortic dissection without evidence of cardiogenic shock or acute aortic regurgitation should be treated with medical therapy to control heart rate and reduce blood pressure. Current guidelines recommend reducing systolic blood pressure to 120 mm Hg or less in the first hour in patients with aortic dissection. Pain control is often necessary and is best accomplished with intravenous opioids. Acute aortic regurgitation due to aortic dissection is a surgical emergency and is especially urgent in the presence of hypotension, pulmonary edema, or cardiogenic shock; it generally requires aortic valve repair or replacement, even for moderate aortic regurgitation."

TEE would be useful if CT angiography were unavailable. In that case, TEE could provide information on both the aortic valve and the ascending aorta. TEE is also useful in intraoperative assessment of aortic valve function before and after the surgical intervention."
