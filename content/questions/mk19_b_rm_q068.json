"). The infiltrative involvement of the parotid and lacrimal glands, together with retroperitoneal fibrosis and periaortitis, is most consistent with IgG4-related disease. IgG4-positive plasmablasts on biopsy confirm the diagnosis. The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase level suggests associated biliary involvement. The absence of elevated serum IgG4 antibodies is not exclusionary because serum antibodies are often not present. Treatment of IgG4-related disease most often consists of initial high-dose glucocorticoids followed by a slow taper. Because the disease often recurs during taper, and because glucocorticoids bear significant toxicity, coadministration of rituximab (an anti-CD20 antibody that indirectly depletes plasmablasts) is often initiated to permit accelerated glucocorticoid taper. However, rituximab monotherapy is also effective and can be used alone in patients with absolute or relative contraindications to glucocorticoid therapy."
