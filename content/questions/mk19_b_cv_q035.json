"A 48-year-old man is evaluated for recurrent pericarditis. Six months ago, he had acute pericarditis treated with ibuprofen and colchicine. His symptoms resolved completely within 3 weeks of initiation of therapy. Evaluations for an infectious cause and connective tissue disease were negative. The patient's symptoms recurred after ibuprofen was tapered over 1 month with continuation of colchicine. Ibuprofen was re-initiated at a high dose with resolution of symptoms and tapered over a 2-month period. His current symptoms began 24 hours ago. Currently, his only medication is colchicine."

"). This patient meets the definition of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis, having a documented first episode of acute pericarditis followed by a recurrent episode after a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks. This patient had a favorable response to initial treatment with an NSAID and colchicine, followed by recurrent symptoms after tapering standard therapy on two different occasions. Recurrence occurs in 15% to 30% of pericarditis cases, and the recurrence rate is higher when initial therapy does not include colchicine. In patients initially treated only with NSAIDs, it would be reasonable to use the combination of NSAIDs and colchicine to treat a recurrence. In patients initially treated with both colchicine and NSAIDs, the addition of a low to moderate dose of prednisone is reasonable to achieve better control of symptoms. When patients re-present with pain but without other evidence of pericarditis, cardiac CT or MRI and measurement of C-reactive protein level may inform the decision of whether to add glucocorticoids. Infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, must be excluded before starting a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are not recommended as first-line therapy for acute pericarditis."
