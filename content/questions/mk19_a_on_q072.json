"). Particular attention should be directed to the primary resection site for evidence of local recurrence (satellite lesions), in-transit metastases (looking for disease traveling along the course of draining lymphatics), and regional nodal involvement. Regional lymph node ultrasound can be performed to better assess for adenopathy in patients with an equivocal lymph node examination. The patient should also be carefully assessed for the development of second primary melanomas, as patients who have had one melanoma have a significantly higher risk of developing second primary melanomas. Furthermore, patients should be educated to perform routine skin self-examinations to screen for both recurrence and for new primary lesions."

"children":[
"Breslow staging indicates the depth of invasion of the melanoma below the surface of the skin. The risk of recurrence increases as the depth of invasion increases. Ulceration at presentation and high mitotic rate are also associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Melanoma can be a very aggressive cancer and can metastasize widely, but if caught early, it has a very high cure rate. In patients such as this one (stage I, cT1aN0 indicating a depth of invasion less than 0.8 mm), the overall cure rate is approximately 95%."
