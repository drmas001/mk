"), a condition most commonly caused by degenerative cervical spondylosis. Combined upper and lower motor neuron findings indicate disease in the spinal cord, the only anatomic location in the body where both segments are found together and can be affected simultaneously. Lower motor neuron weakness originates at the level of compression, and upper motor neuron weakness occurs below it. Cervical spinal cord compression produces lower motor weakness in the arms or hands (atrophy, suppressed reflexes) and upper motor weakness in the legs (increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, clonus, upgoing extensor reflexes in the toes). Lhermitte sign, an electric shock–like pain radiating from the neck to the spine or the arms, can be produced by forward flexion of the neck, but it is insensitive for the presence of cervical cord disease. Clinical diagnosis of cervical myelopathy should be confirmed with MRI. Treatment is surgical decompression."
