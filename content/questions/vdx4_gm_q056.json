"The most likely diagnosis is erythema multiforme (EM), an immune-mediated condition that can be recognized by its classic targetoid plaques. The sharply defined plaques feature two differently colored concentric rings (a pale inner ring and a red outer ring) surrounding a pale, dusky, vesiculated or crusted center. These plaques typically appear on the face and acral sites. Mucosal lesions are present in up to 70% of patients. Crops of lesions persist for approximately 7 days and resolve without scarring."
