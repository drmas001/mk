Persons aged 11 to 18 years who have completed the primary series should receive one dose of the Tdap vaccine. Adults aged 19 years or older who did not receive the Tdap vaccine at age 11 years or older should receive one dose of the Tdap vaccine. All adults should receive a tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) or Tdap booster every 10 years. Pregnant women should receive at least one dose of the Tdap vaccine between 27 weeks' and 36 weeks' gestation with every pregnancy. Pregnant women who had not previously been fully vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria should also receive a Td series."

This patient is up to date on her immunizations, and repeating HPV vaccination during pregnancy is neither recommended nor necessary."
