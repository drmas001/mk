Initial chest radiographs will demonstrate patchy opacities that mimic pneumonia and, as a result, patients are often initially misdiagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and treated with standard antibiotics. However, nonresolving symptoms and failure to respond to antibiotics should raise suspicion for organizing pneumonia or COP. High-resolution CT imaging will ",
