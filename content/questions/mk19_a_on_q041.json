"). Postoperative surveillance following curative resection for colorectal cancer is used to identify oligometastatic disease in the liver or lung that may be resectable. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended annually for up to 5 years postoperatively. Patients with metastatic lesions confined to the liver or lung should be referred for surgical evaluation. Surgery has become standard treatment for patients with resectable oligometastatic disease confined to the liver and can be curative in approximately 25% of these patients. Previous guidelines defined resectability of hepatic metastases based on the number of lesions, tumor size, and potential for clear surgical margins, but newer approaches define resectable disease as metastatic tumors that can be completely resected while leaving an adequate functional residual liver volume."

") is a technique that can be used for control of more vascular tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma or neuroendocrine tumors, but it is not routinely used in colorectal cancer because these tumors tend to be relatively low in vascularity. Further, such embolizations are palliative, noncurative interventions, whereas surgery has curative potential."

") should not be done because it will not affect management. This patient's clinical presentation is compelling enough for recurrent colorectal cancer that a negative needle biopsy would be assumed to be a false-negative result, and so would not alter management, and surgical resection would be the appropriate intervention regardless of the biopsy results. A needle biopsy may be appropriate if the diagnosis is in doubt or if there is consideration for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Consideration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in some treatment centers is based on the potential to convert patients with an initially unresectable large volume of liver metastases to resectable disease. Although data on the frequency of success with this strategy are not available, they are probably low."
