"). This patient has chronic venous insufficiency, which has led to venous stasis changes. The underlying cause of chronic venous insufficiency is venous hypertension, which may develop as a result of obstruction to venous flow (e.g., thrombus), dysfunction of venous valves (e.g., congenital, after injury, venous thrombosis), and failure of the “venous pump” (calf muscle constriction of deep veins). The increase in venous pressure within the deep venous system is directed to the superficial venous system, causing deleterious changes in the microcirculation (such as recruitment of leukocytes, release of inflammatory mediators, and extravasation of proteins and erythrocytes into the extravascular space). Symptoms include aching, itching, restlessness, heaviness, swelling, and pain in the legs. This patient should wear compression stockings (providing 20-50 mm Hg of pressure) and be encouraged to walk or perform heel lifts to facilitate the action of the venous pump. Leg elevation should be recommended to reduce edema, but patient adherence is often difficult. Additional care recommendations include emollients to restore the skin barrier. The skin discoloration is caused by hemosiderin deposition from extravasated erythrocytes."

Cellulitis also can present with swelling and erythema, but only rarely is it present in both legs. Cellulitis can be associated with systemic signs of infection, such as fever and pain, whereas chronic venous insufficiency is not."
