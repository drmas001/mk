The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology recommend restricting ESA use to patients with chemotherapy-associated symptomatic anemia when cancer treatment is not curative in intent to reduce the need for erythrocyte transfusions.

Although this recommendation is viewed by some as controversial, this patient's anemia is asymptomatic and does not require treatment with either an ESA or erythrocyte transfusion."

"Antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or levofloxacin is often administered during induction chemotherapy because of the high rate of infection with gram-negative and encapsulated bacteria during the first 3 months of therapy. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been shown to decrease the number of bacterial infections and serious infections, and levofloxacin prophylaxis has been associated with significantly fewer deaths and febrile episodes during this time period. The planned myeloma treatment is not associated with increased risk of fungal infection; therefore, prophylaxis with fluconazole is not indicated in this patient (",
