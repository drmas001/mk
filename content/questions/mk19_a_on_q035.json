"). Although uncommon, there are increasing reports of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, typically anaplastic T-cell lymphoma, arising around breast implants. The major association has been with textured breast implants, which are now no longer being used. Patients with these lymphomas typically present with swelling and discomfort with a median time of 8 to 9 years after prosthesis placement. Initial evaluation after physical examination is by ultrasound (which appears to be superior to mammography, CT, or MRI) to look for a fluid collection and aspiration if fluid is present. Cytology may confirm malignant cells compatible with anaplastic T-cell lymphoma. These anaplastic T-cell lymphomas are typically CD30+ and ",

" negative. If the disease is diagnosed early, it may be cured with surgery alone with removal of the implant and complete resection of the surrounding capsule. If a contralateral implant was placed, it should be removed as well. In cases of more advanced disease with nodal involvement, more distant spread, or recurrence, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be indicated. Treatment is not yet standardized, and recommendations continue to evolve for this entity."
