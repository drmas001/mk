Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection involving the deeper dermis and subcutaneous tissues; it is most frequently associated with dermatologic conditions involving breaks in the skin, such as eczema, tinea pedis, or chronic skin ulcers, and conditions leading to chronic lymphedema, such as mastectomy with lymph node dissection or saphenous vein grafting in bypass surgery. Cellulitis should be suspected in patients with acute-onset spreading erythema, edema, pain or tenderness, and warmth. Fever, although common, is not uniformly present. Patients with severe disease may have associated systemic toxicity. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis, although cultures of any drainage should be performed for those who are immunocompromised, exhibit severe sepsis, or have unusual precipitating circumstances, including immersion injury or animal bites.
