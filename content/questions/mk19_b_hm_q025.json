Laboratory findings are limited to a low platelet count. On the peripheral blood smear, platelets appear as small purplish cells without a nucleus. As a rule of thumb, approximately seven platelets are normally seen per 100-power field. Giant platelets are typically associated with increased platelet production secondary to the stress of increased peripheral platelet destruction.
