Mild infections involve only skin and subcutaneous tissue, with erythema confined to 2 cm beyond the ulcer. Moderate infections extend deeper than subcutaneous tissue (e.g., abscess, fasciitis, and osteomyelitis), or the erythema is more extensive. Severe infections are associated with systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and hypotension or metabolic complications such as acidosis, worsening kidney function, and hyperglycemia. The affected foot or limb should also be assessed for arterial ischemia, venous insufficiency, neuropathy, and biomechanical abnormalities such as Charcot arthropathy or hammer toe. Evidence of critical ischemia may be considered a proxy for severe infection. Uninfected wounds should not be cultured or treated with antibiotics. Mild infections, such as present in this patient, are typically caused by aerobic staphylococci (non–methicillin-resistant ",
