"). Patients with long-standing, poorly controlled inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or rheumatoid arthritis, can develop renal amyloidosis (AA amyloidosis). The prevalence of kidney disease in AS is 2% to 13%; in the past, AA amyloidosis was the leading cause of kidney disease (and remains a major cause) in patients with uncontrolled AS. With the advent of biologic therapy and subsequent control of inflammation in AS, the prevalence of AA amyloidosis has declined. AA amyloidosis most commonly affects the kidneys, manifesting as proteinuria and eventually end-stage kidney disease. It less commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract, heart, and peripheral nerves. In AS, AA amyloidosis is most often seen in men, patients with peripheral joint disease, and patients with a history of uveitis. Affected patients will usually manifest high levels of inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, indicating insufficient control of disease-related inflammation. Treatment with effective medications, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, may stabilize or improve the kidney manifestations of AA amyloidosis in patients with AS. When AA amyloidosis is suspected, Congo red staining of biopsy specimens from the kidney, rectum, or abdominal subcutaneous fat will reveal amyloid deposition."
