"). Most forms of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) are autosomal dominant, resulting in deficiencies of the erythrocyte membrane proteins that anchor the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Membrane loss causes a decreased surface-to-volume ratio and loss of the biconcave shape, resulting in a more spherical erythrocyte shape (spherocytes). The structural erythrocyte changes lead to less deformability in the microcirculation and increase phagocytosis by macrophages, mainly in the spleen, resulting in hemolysis. Splenomegaly is common. Laboratory findings include anemia, reticulocytosis, signs of hemolysis, and an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The clinical severity of HS varies considerably. Mild forms are common, with normal or near-normal hemoglobin levels, and patients can compensate for the hemolysis. Those with severe forms have more brisk hemolysis and a greater degree of anemia, which often worsens at times of oxidative stress, such as viral infections; pigmented gallstones and aplastic crises from parvovirus infections can also be seen. Treatment depends on disease severity. Mild forms can be monitored. Patients with HS, as with other hemolytic states, have increased folate requirements and should receive supplemental folate. A typical dose for moderate to severe hemolysis is 1 to 2 mg/day."

"In warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pathogenic IgG antibodies are directed against Rh-type antigens on the erythrocyte surface. IgG-coated erythrocytes can be completely phagocytized by splenic macrophages via the Fc receptor and are cleared from the circulation. The basic principle of therapy is alleviating immune destruction of erythrocytes by halting antibody production using glucocorticoids or rituximab (",
