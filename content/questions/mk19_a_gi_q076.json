" infection, ethnicity, age, family history, and other environmental factors, such as autoimmune metaplasia, infection with Epstein-Barr virus, high salt intake, consumption of pickled foods, and use of tobacco products. Although gastric cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and the third most deadly cancer worldwide (nearly 800,000 deaths annually), it is uncommon in North America, with an estimated incidence of only 6 in 100,000. Given the low risk for gastric cancer in the United States, routine use of endoscopic surveillance is not recommended for GIM. Surveillance should therefore be tailored to the characteristics of GIM in addition to risk factors. Risk factors for gastric cancer identified by the American Gastroenterological Association include the presence of incomplete or extensive GIM; having a first-degree relative with gastric cancer; race/ethnicity (African American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American/Alaskan Native); and/or being first- or second-generation immigrants from high-incidence areas, including South America, Central America, Mexico, Caribbean nations, East Asia, Southeast Asia, post-Soviet states, Iran, and Turkey. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends that individuals with higher risk should be considered for surveillance endoscopy based on shared decision-making in which the patient puts a high value on the possible increased risk for gastric cancer and a low value on the risks associated with repeat endoscopy. The optimal interval for surveillance endoscopy remains unknown; however, indirect data suggest a 3- to 5-year interval for endoscopy."
