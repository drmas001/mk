"). This elderly patient likely has a lamotrigine-related rash. Lamotrigine may cause a morbiliform rash, which most commonly resolves with discontinuation of the drug but sometimes may be severe and life-threatening. This patient's rash is likely not a serious rash based on the lack of mucosal involvement, lymphadenopathy, and systemic features, including fever. Reassuring laboratory findings include the absence of eosinophilia and normal aminotransaminase levels. Morbilliform reactions are the most common drug reactions and are most likely a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. As such, the rash appears in the first or second week after drug exposure. Patients develop pink papules and macules that coalesce symmetrically to form plaques. The papules are often dense and monomorphic and are accompanied by varying degrees of pruritus beginning on the trunk and progressing distally across the limbs. Palms and soles are usually spared. Treatment involves cessation of the causative agent, systemic and/or topical glucocorticoids, and oral H1 antihistamines. Any patient taking an antiepileptic drug should be counseled to stop their medication and to contact their clinician if a rash develops, and seek emergency care if fevers, skin pain, blisters, pustules, or mucous membrane involvement is present, indicating serious and potentially life-threating conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. Gabapentin has a low incidence of rash and other allergic reactions and also has good evidence of efficacy in focal epilepsy in older adults; thus, it is the most appropriate replacement for lamotrigine."
