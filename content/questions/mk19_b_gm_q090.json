"). This patient has bilateral cyclic breast pain. Most common in women aged 20 to 39 years, cyclic breast pain is often diffuse and bilateral, occurs during the premenstrual phase, and resolves with onset of menstruation; it is usually associated with hormonal changes and is typically benign. If findings on clinical breast examination (CBE) are normal, additional screening for malignancy beyond age-appropriate screening is not required. Cyclic breast pain should be managed conservatively with education, reassurance regarding the absence of malignancy, and wearing a supportive and well-fitting bra. Although some patients benefit from topical NSAID therapy, pain resolves spontaneously for most women. There is a lack of evidence to support limiting caffeine intake or using vitamin E as a means of mitigating the pain."

Given this patient's age, she does not qualify for routine screening mammography, and her family history does not suggest a hereditary cancer syndrome that would qualify for early screening. Mammography would be the most appropriate management in patients older than 30 years who present with noncyclic focal breast pain or have an abnormal CBE. Noncyclic breast pain is often caused by medication use (contraceptive agents, hormone replacement therapy, psychiatric medications), underlying breast disease (fibrocystic disease, infection, trauma, cancer), or stretching of the Cooper ligaments (connective tissue that maintains breast structural integrity)."
