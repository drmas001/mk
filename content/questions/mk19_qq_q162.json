") in this patient with a hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergencies are defined as severe elevations in blood pressure (BP) (for example, higher than 180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of new or worsening end-organ damage. Patients with a compelling indication require urgent BP reduction. Compelling indications include aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, and pheochromocytoma. In patients with a compelling indication, systolic BP should be reduced to less than 140 mm Hg during the first hour and to less than 120 mm Hg in aortic dissection. In aortic dissection, intravenous β-blockers are the initial drugs of choice owing to their antihypertensive and negative chronotropic effects, which lead to reduced shear stress on the aortic wall. Options include labetalol and esmolol. Esmolol is a very short-acting agent that allows careful titration of BP and heart rate."
