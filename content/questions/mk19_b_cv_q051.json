") is indicated for this patient with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by right ventricular (RV) infarction. RV infarction is rarely an isolated event; it occurs in as many as one third of patients with an inferior MI and is most commonly associated with proximal right coronary artery events. Acute resuscitation of patients with RV ischemic dysfunction is aimed at reversing the resultant decrease in left ventricular (LV) preload and subsequent reduction in cardiac output. Prompt reperfusion followed by intravenous volume expansion with up to several liters of intravenous fluids increases right ventricular preload and contractility, thus increasing flow through the pulmonary circuit into the left atrium and ultimately enhancing LV preload and cardiac output. Although long-term prognosis is good when appropriate treatment is initiated promptly, RV infarction is associated with high inpatient morbidity and mortality. Early recognition is therefore essential and may be facilitated by identification of 1 mm or more of ST-segment elevation in lead V",

Findings of normal or modestly elevated central venous pressure with clear lungs despite tachycardia and/or hypotension are suggestive of an RV infarction complicating inferior ST-elevation MI; however, these findings also may be seen in cardiac tamponade, and confirmation of RV infarction physiology and absence of pericardial effusion by echocardiography is indicated."
