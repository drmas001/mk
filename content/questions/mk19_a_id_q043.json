"A 51-year-old woman is hospitalized for fever, confusion, tremors, involuntary movements of her arms and legs, and lower extremity weakness. Her illness began with fever, malaise and headache quickly followed by neurologic symptoms. She was airlifted from China back to the United States. She has spent the last 3 months working in rural and urban areas of Nepal, South Korea, Vietnam, and China. Her only travel-related precautions have been daily atovaquone-proguanil to prevent malaria. Medical history is unremarkable, and she takes no other medications."

Neurologic manifestations develop rapidly, encephalitis being the most common. Focal neurologic abnormalities, including paresis, cranial nerve palsies, flaccid paralysis, and parkinsonian-like movement disorders, frequently accompany the encephalopathic state. Some patients become comatose. Japanese encephalitis may also present as mild, febrile, aseptic meningitis. Thalamic lesions seen on MRI scans are typical; diagnosis is confirmed by early detection of IgM antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid, and later in the serum. Although the virus is endemic throughout most of Asia and portions of the Western Pacific, the incidence of infection is low in travelers to these areas. A vaccine is available that can produce effective immunity."
