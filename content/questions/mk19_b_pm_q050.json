"A 58-year-old man hospitalized 5 days ago for a COPD exacerbation is now evaluated for discharge. He required bilevel positive airway pressure for 1 day because of acute hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory failure. He was treated with prednisone and levofloxacin. This is his second hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation in the past 6 months and the fourth course of prednisone for his COPD in that time. Before hospitalization, his baseline function was limiting dyspnea after walking a few minutes. Medications are inhaled fluticasone furoate-umeclidinium-vilanterol."

Roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, can reduce symptoms and exacerbations in patients with severe COPD who have a chronic bronchitis phenotype or frequent exacerbations. Given this patient's clinical picture, he would likely benefit from the addition of roflumilast. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, can also be used for patients with COPD and persistent exacerbations, especially in those who are current nonsmokers. There are no head-to-head comparisons of roflumilast with azithromycin. The choice of medication is determined by the medication's side effects, drug interactions, and contraindications."
