"A 27-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department for inability to eat, drink, or swallow his saliva for the past 2 hours. Symptoms began while he was eating chicken, when he felt that the bolus did not move all the way down his esophagus. During evaluation, he begins to sense that he can swallow again. He has had several previous but less severe episodes of dysphagia. His other medical conditions include asthma, seasonal allergies, and episodes of eczema. Current medications are budesonide-formoterol inhaler and loratadine as needed."

"). This patient presented with a food impaction that resolved spontaneously. Most patients with EoE are men diagnosed between the second and fifth decades of life, and many have other atopic conditions, such as asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, and seasonal or food allergies. The diagnostic criteria for EoE are symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, esophageal biopsy specimens showing persistent eosinophil counts of at least 15/hpf, and exclusion of other causes of eosinophilia. Examples of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia include gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, infections (i.e., fungal, viral), autoimmune and connective tissue disorders, Crohn disease with esophageal involvement, and drug hypersensitivity reactions. Peripheral eosinophilia is not a diagnostic criterion for EoE. Upper endoscopy with biopsies to confirm this diagnosis is appropriate. Treatment options include a proton pump inhibitor, swallowed topical glucocorticoids (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide), and/or endoscopic dilation. An empiric elimination diet may help treat and prevent flares in EoE."
