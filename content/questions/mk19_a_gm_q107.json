She has no cardiac or pulmonary symptoms; has never smoked cigarettes; and works as an accountant, mainly from home. She has no other symptoms or medical problems and takes no medications."

") should be performed next. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is helpful in the evaluation of patients with chronic dyspnea without a known cause after the completion of routine testing. It can also aid in the evaluation of patients with multiple potential causes of dyspnea. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is typically performed using specialized equipment that allows for continuous cardiopulmonary assessment with ECG; blood pressure monitoring; pulse oximetry; and measurement of respiratory rate, tidal volume, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and work output. Common indications for cardiopulmonary exercise testing include assessment of undiagnosed exercise intolerance, measurement of exercise tolerance in patients with known cardiac or pulmonary disease, upcoming lung resection, and assessment of disability. Testing can lead to physiologic understanding of the cause of dyspnea (cardiovascular, ventilatory and gas exchange response, metabolic issues), narrowing the differential diagnosis, or it can support the diagnosis of deconditioning as a cause of symptoms."

D-dimer tests are highly sensitive but nonspecific in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and false-positive results are common, including in individuals older than 50 years. A positive D-dimer result in this patient with chronic dyspnea and no other findings of pulmonary embolism will probably be false-positive and fail to advance the diagnosis of her dyspnea."
