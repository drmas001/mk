In addition, there is a loss of volume on the left, as indicated by the leftward movement of the mediastinum. Although mediastinal borders are difficult to discern, the absence of a right heart border to the right of the spine indicates the leftward movement of the heart. The heart's position can also be inferred by the leftward position of the pulmonary artery catheter."
