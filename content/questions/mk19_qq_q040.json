Patients with CVID have a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders, particularly autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, pernicious anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as disorders of the gastrointestinal tract leading to diarrhea and malabsorption. A higher incidence of CVID exists in those of northern European ancestry, and there is a familial predisposition to selective IgA deficiency and malignancies. If serum IgG and IgA or IgM levels are low, the antibody response to protein- and polysaccharide-based vaccines should then be assessed. If IgG levels are very low (<200 mg/dL [2 g/L]) or undetectable, assessment of vaccine response is not necessary because antibody levels are predictably absent. Therefore, the first step in the evaluation of patients with suspected CVID is measurement of serum immunoglobulin levels."
