"). The patient has an indeterminate lung nodule that is 7 mm in size; the first step in evaluation is to estimate the probability of malignancy. This can be done qualitatively or quantitatively with risk prediction calculators. Calculating the probability of malignancy is most useful in treating nodules that are 8 to 30 mm in diameter and helps to determine subsequent testing and diagnostic strategy. One commonly used risk calculator is the Brock model (",

"). This model considers the following as risk factors: older age, female sex, family history of lung cancer, emphysema, larger nodule size, location of the nodule in the upper lobe, part-solid nodule type, lower nodule count (one to four nodules is associated with a higher risk of malignancy, whereas five or more is associated with a lower risk of malignancy), and spiculation. A low-risk nodule measuring 6 to 8 mm should be monitored with serial CT, the first CT examination in 6 to 12 months, and then CT at 18 to 24 months can be considered."
