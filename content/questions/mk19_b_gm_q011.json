"). Owing to both their disease and its treatment, patients with rheumatologic disease undergoing elective surgery are at higher risk for perioperative infectious complications, including risk for periâ€“prosthetic joint infection in total joint arthroplasties of the hip and knee. Appropriate management of antirheumatic medication in the perioperative period mitigates this risk. Elective surgery should be delayed until the underlying disease is controlled and preferably in remission, because this is associated with reduced infection risk and improved outcomes. All nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be continued throughout the perioperative period in patients undergoing elective joint replacement. Evidence suggests that continuing DMARDs is associated with a lower risk for infections versus discontinuing DMARDs at the time of surgery. Disease flares are also less frequent after surgery in patients who continue DMARDs perioperatively. Biologic agents, such as adalimumab (",
{
"type":"tag",
"tagName":"b",
"attrs":{

"children":[
"Option A"
]
},
"), should be withheld for one dosing cycle before the surgery, with surgery performed at the end of the cycle. Janus kinase inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, should be withheld for at least 7 days before surgery. Once the operative wound shows evidence of healing (typically around 14 days), agents that have been withheld should be resumed at the previously established dose."
