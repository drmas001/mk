") are asymptomatic and have normal life expectancy, with diagnosis often resulting from evaluation of a heart murmur or abnormal ECG. Physical examination findings may be normal in patients without left ventricular outflow obstruction. The most common feature related to left ventricular outflow obstruction is a cardiac murmur, and dynamic maneuvers during examination are helpful in differentiating HCM from fixed valvular obstruction, such as aortic stenosis. HCM is associated with an ejection-quality murmur usually best heard at left lower sternal border; it generally does not radiate to the carotid arteries. Brisk carotid upstroke is present and may have two impulses for each ejection (bifid). The murmur of HCM increases in intensity of murmur during Valsalva strain phase. The murmur of aortic stenosis either does not change or is diminished during Valsalva strain phase. This patient's findings are not compatible with findings associated with HCM."
