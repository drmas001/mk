For patients who have hypogammaglobinemia, randomized trials demonstrate a lower rate of recurrent infections with administration of intravenous gamma globulin every 3 to 4 weeks. Intravenous gamma globulin is usually given with the goal of raising the IgG level to at least 600 mg/dL (6.0 g/L). Seasonal influenza vaccinations as well as COVID-19 and pneumococcal vaccinations (either 20-valent conjugate vaccine alone or 15-valent conjugate vaccine followed by 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine at least 1 year later) should be given to patients with CLL, although it is known that the response to these vaccines may be impaired from the underlying disease and its treatment."
