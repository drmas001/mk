") is the most appropriate next step in management. This patient has symptoms and examination findings (positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver) consistent with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV, the most common form of vertigo, is characterized by dizziness, imbalance, nausea, and vomiting that occur with positional changes of the head. The vertiginous symptoms are sudden in onset, recurrent, and brief (usually <1 minute), with no focal neurologic findings. BPPV is caused by otoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) coming loose and moving within the fluid-filled semicircular canals. The canalith repositioning (Epley) maneuver will move otoconia from the semicircular canals back to the utricle, resolving symptoms in up to 85% of patients with BPPV."

") would be appropriate if the examination findings raised concern for central vertigo. In that case, examination would show a negative Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew) examination for central vertigo would show absence of catch-up saccades, bidirectional nystagmus, and vertical skew. An abnormal result on any one of the three HINTS components suggests a central rather than peripheral cause of acute vertigo. The HINTS examination is most applicable in patients with persistent rather than episodic vertigo."
