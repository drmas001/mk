" gene comprise the most prevalent form of hereditary hemochromatosis, with a prevalence of 1 in 250 persons of northern European descent. The C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations are the three most common, and homozygosity for C282Y accounts for 80% to 90% of patients with hemochromatosis who have a genetic mutation. Heterozygosity is common in patients of European ancestry. Iron overload is extremely rare in heterozygous individuals, and evidence of elevated iron indices (ferritin level >1000 ng/mL [1000 μg/L], transferrin saturation >45%) should raise suspicion for a concomitant rare mutation that may not be detected with standardized testing. The 2019 guideline from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) recommends treatment in patients with homozygous C282Y mutations with serum ferritin greater than 300 ng/mL (300 μg/L) in men and greater than 200 ng/mL (200 μg/L) in women, along with a transferrin saturation of 45% or more. Other sources recommend observation for serum ferritin levels less than 500 ng/mL (500 μg/L) regardless of genotype. This patient has a heterozygous C282Y mutation without elevated iron indices; therefore, without symptoms, no intervention or ongoing surveillance is required."
