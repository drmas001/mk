She received her measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine during childhood and an influenza vaccine during the most recent influenza season. She received the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine 6 years ago and recently completed the hepatitis B vaccine series. She is unsure whether she had chickenpox. She is sexually active with her husband only. Her last Pap smear was obtained 1 year ago and was normal; human papillomavirus testing was negative. She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin."
