Angulated retiform purpura can be the presenting manifestation of APAS."

"Diagnosis of APAS is based on the clinical criteria of thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity and laboratory findings of medium- or high-titer antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) present on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. A clue to the presence of lupus anticoagulant is prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time, as seen with this patient."
