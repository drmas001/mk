"), an anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent. The patient presented with a flare of severe ileocolonic Crohn disease. She has required several courses of glucocorticoid treatment because maintenance therapy with azathioprine, an immunomodulator, failed. The anti-TNF agents infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab treat moderate to severe Crohn disease that is resistant to glucocorticoids or immunomodulators. Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine is more efficacious than monotherapy with either agent alone in achieving glucocorticoid-free remission and mucosal healing. Before initiation of anti-TNF agents, patients should undergo testing for latent tuberculosis because of an increased risk for reactivation of tuberculosis during therapy. If latent tuberculosis is present, treatment with isoniazid should be administered for at least 2 months before initiation of anti-TNF therapy. Patients should also be assessed for chronic hepatitis B virus infection before starting anti-TNF therapy and receive treatment if needed."
