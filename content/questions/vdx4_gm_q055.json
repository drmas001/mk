The pain is located laterally, with localized tenderness over the lateral epicondyle. Pain characteristically radiates down the forearm to the dorsal hand, and worsens with activity and at night. On examination, there is tenderness to palpation where the extensor muscles attach to the lateral epicondyle. Pain increases with forced extension of the wrist."
