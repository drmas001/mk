"). Loss of expression of mismatch repair proteins would be expected in approximately 15% of patients with colorectal cancer. Of these 15% with mismatch repair protein deficiency, approximately one in five will have a germline mismatch repair deficiency, which is known as Lynch syndrome. Patients with Lynch syndrome require more extensive surveillance for additional colorectal cancers and other malignancies. Lynch syndrome is autosomal dominant, and so identification also has important implications for family screening and surveillance. The most common cancers in Lynch syndrome are colorectal and uterine, so this patient's family history is concerning for Lynch syndrome."
