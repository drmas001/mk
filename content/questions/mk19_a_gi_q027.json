"). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an autoimmune fibroinflammatory disease of the intrahepatic bile ducts; it most commonly affects the large ducts but can also affect the small intrahepatic ducts. It is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in about 85% of cases and occurs in approximately 7.5% of patients with ulcerative colitis. PSC can be diagnosed with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Although a liver biopsy is rarely needed to diagnose PSC, diagnosis of small-duct PSC requires a liver biopsy. In this patient at risk for sclerosing cholangitis, with liver enzyme levels indicating cholestatic liver disease and a normal MRCP result, a liver biopsy should be performed to evaluate for small-duct PSC."

"Drug-induced liver injury encompasses a spectrum of liver injury and can be induced by many medications. This patient demonstrates cholestatic injury characterized by a disproportionate elevation in the alkaline phosphatase level compared with serum aminotransferase levels. Levofloxacin is more commonly associated with a hepatocellular pattern of injury characterized primarily by elevations of aminotransferase levels. More importantly, the cholestatic pattern of liver injury was discovered before initiation of levofloxacin, strongly suggesting another cause for the patient's liver injury. Therefore, discontinuation of levofloxacin (",

The presence of biliary dilatation on ultrasonography indicates gallstones, strictures, or malignancy, whereas the absence of biliary dilatation is compatible with intrahepatic cholestasis. In this patient with ulcerative colitis and a pattern of cholestatic injury, MRCP was appropriately performed and had normal results. MRCP is more sensitive in the diagnosis of sclerosing cholangitis than is ultrasonography. Liver ultrasonography will not provide any additional useful information. The most helpful diagnostic test will be a liver biopsy."
