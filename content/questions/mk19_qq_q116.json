") is the most likely cause of this patient's hand dermatitis. ACD is a type IV or delayed hypersensitivity reaction caused by allergen-specific T lymphocytes. The first reaction to an allergen may occur several weeks after exposure, but subsequent reactions usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of re-exposure. Reactions often become more intense with repeated exposure. ACD is usually intensely itchy. In acute reactions, the skin is red, edematous, weepy, and crusted, with possible vesicles or bullae. Chronic exposure results in chronic eczema. The hands are a common site for ACD, especially in health care workers. Exposure history and pattern of the rash may provide clues as to the causal allergen. Epicutaneous patch testing is the gold standard for diagnosis of ACD and should be performed to evaluate recurrent or recalcitrant dermatitis. Patch testing is performed by applying multiple standardized chemicals on small discs to the patient's back, typically over three visits within a 1-week period. Patients should diligently avoid any identified allergens. Acutely, topical glucocorticoids are used for pruritus and inflammation. Systemic glucocorticoids may be used for severe cases for 2 to 3 weeks but should not be a long-term therapy."
