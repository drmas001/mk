The patient is unable to sit or stand for long periods, but the pain improves when lying down. Bladder and bowel habits have not changed. His only medication is ibuprofen for pain."

Pain is induced with palpation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles and by flexion and extension of the lower back, and lumbar movement is limited by pain. Reflexes are normal, and no weakness or sensory deficits are noted. Ipsilateral and contralateral straight leg raise test results are negative."

Potentially useful nonpharmacologic therapies for acute low back pain include local heat, massage, and acupuncture, although the evidence supporting these approaches is generally weak. Spinal manipulation therapy has moderate evidence for modest pain reduction and improvement in function. The harms of nonpharmacologic therapy are minimal, and the overall prognosis for nonspecific low back pain is excellent, with most patients improving rapidly in the first month."
