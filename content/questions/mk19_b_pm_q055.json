"). There are no universally accepted criteria for admission to an ICU. Signs and symptoms of clinical instability, including hypotension, hypoxemia, arrhythmias, and mental status changes, may be useful to identify patients who require intense resources or may be at risk of sudden deterioration. This patient has many findings to suggest clinical instability, including abnormal oxygen saturation, borderline hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status. Scoring systems such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) can be helpful screening tools. Because there is no perfect test for identifying sepsis, scoring systems should not be used as the sole indicator of disease or triage needs."
