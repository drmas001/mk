") as soon as possible. The patient is experiencing high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), which is caused by exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and abnormally high pulmonary artery and capillary pressures. The resulting leakage of edema fluid into the alveolus causes hypoxemia and may evoke an inflammatory response. Risks for this disorder include rapid ascent to altitudes greater than 2500 meters (~8200 feet), the actual altitude attained, time spent at altitude, and a history of high-altitude illness. The typical symptoms of HAPE (cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue) can be difficult to distinguish from pneumonia. As HAPE progresses, patients can develop pink frothy sputum, hemoptysis, and life-threatening hypoxemia. Treatment of HAPE focuses on promptly reducing the pulmonary artery pressure. This can be done by providing supplemental oxygen, limiting the patient's physical exertion and cold exposure, and advising the patient to descend to a lower altitude as soon as possible. This patient has received supplemental oxygen and should descend to a lower altitude. Some clinicians suggest the use of nifedipine as adjunctive therapy, but there is a paucity of data to confirm its benefit."
