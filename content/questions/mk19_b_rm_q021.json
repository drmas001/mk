However, she cannot take allopurinol because of a history of a rash with previous use. An uncommon but serious complication of allopurinol is a hypersensitivity reaction, which may lead to organ dysfunction and death. Therefore, allopurinol is not appropriate, and therapy with febuxostat, a nonpurine, noncompetitive xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated. Because only 3% of febuxostat is renally cleared, it may be used in patients with CKD without dose adjustment if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m",

". The starting febuxostat dosage is 40 mg/d, which may be increased to up to 80 mg/d if needed on the basis of serum urate level. Achieving and maintaining a serum urate target of less than 6.0 mg/dL (0.35 mmol/L) are strongly recommended for all patients receiving urate-lowering therapy. Prophylaxis with prednisone should be continued along with febuxostat for 3 to 6 months or until the serum urate level is at target."
