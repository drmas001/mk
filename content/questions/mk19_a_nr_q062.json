"). This patient presents with bilateral optic neuritis. T2-weighted MRI of the thoracic spine shows a longitudinally extensive (≥3 spinal segments) myelitis. These findings are most suggestive of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a demyelinating disorder caused by antibodies against aquaporin-4 channels that results in inflammatory demyelination in the optic nerves and spinal cord. Although NMO may present with symptoms that are similar to multiple sclerosis, distinguishing features include bilateral (rather than unilateral) optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive (rather than segmental) myelitis. If there is brain involvement, brainstem or hypothalamic syndromes may be seen. However, the brain may not be involved, as in this patient whose brain MRI was normal. The marked spinal fluid pleocytosis with mostly neutrophils also is consistent with NMO and would be highly unusual for multiple sclerosis (MS) (in which cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] leukocytes are often normal or slightly elevated). Aquaporin-4 antibody is a specific biomarker for NMO and has a direct role in the pathogenesis; diagnostic sensitivity and specificity has been reported to be as high as 91% and 100%, respectively."
