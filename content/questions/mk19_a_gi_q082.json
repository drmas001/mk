"). Patients with cirrhosis are at risk for metabolic bone disease and osteoporosis. Bone densitometry is thus indicated in patients with cirrhosis to screen for metabolic bone disease, and bone-fortifying therapy is indicated in patients found to have osteoporosis. The management of chronic pain can be challenging in patients with chronic liver disease because the recognized adverse effects of analgesic medications can be exaggerated in these patients. Nonpharmacologic approaches to managing chronic pain should always be considered because they will not exacerbate the manifestations of chronic liver disease. Therefore, physical therapy should be considered initially in this patient population. Other nonpharmacologic therapies, including local injection therapies and behavioral therapy, may also be beneficial."
