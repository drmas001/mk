" infection is confirmed, eradication therapy should be pursued because it may relieve symptoms. Some evidence suggests that a subset of patients with functional dyspepsia are sensitive to acid; therefore, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be the initial therapy. However, pooled studies indicate that about 70% of patients with functional dyspepsia still have dyspeptic symptoms after a 2- to 8-week PPI trial. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective in the treatment of functional dyspepsia. Pooled results of three clinical trials involving 339 patients with this disorder demonstrated superiority of TCAs over placebo (number needed to treat, 6). The adverse events of TCAs, such as constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, and somnolence, can be minimized by initiating TCA therapy at a low dosage (e.g., 10 mg once daily) and slowly titrating the dose by 10-mg increments every several weeks."
