There is no history of high-risk sexual behavior. He is otherwise well and takes no medications."

"). This patient's findings on the Mini-Cog test suggest cognitive impairment, and further investigation is warranted. Assessment for a reversible cause of cognitive impairment is the initial recommended strategy and should include evaluation for depression and sleep disorders, consideration of medication adverse effects and alcohol use, basic laboratory studies, and basic neuroimaging (MRI or CT without contrast). The symptoms of depression in geriatric patients can differ slightly from those in the general population, and depression symptoms can be misattributed to aging or chronic illness; therefore, depression might not be identified as readily in older patients. Depression in older adults may also be confused with cognitive dysfunction and is itself a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction. Older adults with depression are often treated with pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy may also be considered as primary treatment or as adjunctive therapy."
