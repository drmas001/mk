"). Nonmodifiable risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) include age (94% of new cases of CRC occurring in adults age 45 years or older), male sex, and a personal or family history of colon adenomas or colorectal cancer. The risk doubles with a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative. Long-standing (â‰¥8 years) colonic inflammatory bowel disease (both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) is associated with about a 2.7-fold increased risk and is dependent on the severity and extent of bowel involvement. Adult survivors of childhood malignancy who received abdominal radiation are also at increased risk for CRC. Familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome are associated with markedly increased risks for colorectal neoplasia and other malignancies. This patient has a nonsyndromic family history, which is also associated with increased CRC risk. If CRC is diagnosed in a first-degree relative aged less than 60 years or two or more first-degree relatives at any age, colonoscopy should begin at age 40 years or 10 years earlier than the age of the youngest first-degree relative at diagnosis, whichever comes first. This patient, with a first-degree relative diagnosed at age 54 years, should initiate CRC screening at age 40 years because it is the earlier of the two options. Colonoscopy should be repeated every 5 years."
