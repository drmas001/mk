"). Possible reasons for this patient's sudden hypotension include procedure-related hemothorax and tension pneumothorax. In patients in shock, point-of-care lung ultrasonography can help rapidly assess patients for pneumothorax and pleural fluid. Point-of-care ultrasonography when placing central venous catheters is associated with reduced periprocedural complications, including bleeding and pneumothorax. However, these complications still occur. In this patient, rapid onset of hypotension and poor lung and heart sounds should prompt the clinician to evaluate for intrathoracic bleeding or pneumothorax. The clinician can do so using point-of-care ultrasonography. In addition, lung ultrasonography can quickly visualize very small amounts of fluid within the pleural space."

Alternative measures that can be done quickly at the bedside are indicated to assess for periprocedural complications."

") can help reverse the hemodynamic impact of a tension pneumothorax and often serves as a temporizing measure until a thoracostomy is placed. However, this maneuver is associated with risk, including intercostal or pulmonary vascular injury, intercostal nerve injury, and cardiac puncture or tamponade. In addition, if tension pneumothorax is not the cause of the hypotension, the patient would unnecessarily need a thoracostomy to re-expand the lung. It is not clear whether tension pneumothorax has caused this patient's hypotension, especially given that breath sounds are diminished on both sides. Needle thoracostomy should not be performed without first establishing the diagnosis of pneumothorax."
