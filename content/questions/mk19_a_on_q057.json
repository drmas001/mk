This involves the TNM system, in which the extent of the tumor (size and/or depth of penetration), nodes (number of local-regional nodes that contain cancer), and metastases (present or absent) are considered. TNM scorings are placed on a scale of stage I though IV, with stage I having the best prognosis and stage IV the worst."

"), which is a designation of the overall medical wellness, or lack thereof, of the patient may have important prognostic implications within a particular stage of disease but is far less significant prognostically than the staging itself. It is important to differentiate patients with a poor performance status who are debilitated due to chronic comorbidities from patients who would otherwise be medically fit but are acutely debilitated by their cancer. The latter situation may warrant an attempt at aggressive treatment because reversing the cancer process is the only option that will improve the patient's overall condition, whereas the former may need to be treated with less aggressive treatment or possibly no specific anticancer treatment."
