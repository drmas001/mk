The first step in the evaluation of any patient with thrombocytopenia is to review the PBS and confirm the platelet count. Pseudothrombocytopenia occurs when a patient has antibodies to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), causing platelets to clump together in vitro. In patients with platelet clumping on the PBS, an accurate count can be obtained from blood drawn in citrate or heparin instead of EDTA. Inaccurate platelet counts may also occur if the platelets are exceptionally large (complete blood count machine may count them as erythrocytes) or if erythrocyte fragments (schistocytes) are counted by the machine as if they were platelets (leading to a higher than actual platelet count)."

If erythrocyte destruction is confirmed, a direct antiglobulin test should be obtained."
