") is required for this patient with symptoms consistent with neurally mediated syncope (also known as neurocardiogenic or reflex syncope), the most common form of syncope. The underlying syncopal mechanism, termed the neurocardiogenic or vasodepressor reflex, is a response of vasodilation, bradycardia, and systemic hypotension, which leads to transient hypoperfusion of the brain. Neurally mediated syncope includes vasovagal syncope, which may be provoked by noxious stimuli, fear, stress, or heat overexposure; situational syncope, which is triggered by cough, micturition, defecation, or deglutition; and carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is sometimes experienced during head rotation, shaving, or use of a tight-fitting neck collar. Suggestive features of vasovagal syncope include any of the “3 Ps”: posture (occurrence during prolonged standing or aborted by lying down), provoking factors (e.g., pain or a medical procedure), and prodromal symptoms (diaphoresis, warmth, and pallor). All patients with syncope should undergo ECG, but patients with uncomplicated vasovagal syncope do not require further investigation or specialist referral. This patient's bradycardia is likely a result of the vasovagal physiology, which can cause peripheral vasodilation, bradycardia, or both. Patients should be counseled to maintain adequate hydration and perform counterpressure maneuvers like crossing/flexing their legs or lying down if the symptoms recur."

This patient's syncope is not arrhythmogenic, and electrocardiographic monitoring is not indicated."
