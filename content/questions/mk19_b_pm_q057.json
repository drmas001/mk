"). This patient has septic shock related to the necrotic diabetic foot ulcer. Despite aggressive early resuscitation with crystalloid fluids and concomitant vasopressors, the patient's hemodynamic status remains unstable. The use of glucocorticoids in the setting of sepsis has been suggested to achieve hemodynamic stability in patients with an ongoing vasopressor requirement. A 2018 meta-analysis of 42 trials concluded that although there was no evidence that glucocorticoids improve mortality, patients with septic shock who receive glucocorticoids are more likely to have reversal of shock within 7 days. Guidelines published by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine in 2017 recommend consideration of glucocorticoids for patients with refractory septic shock at a maximum dose of 400 mg hydrocortisone daily or the equivalent using another glucocorticoid. The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend hydrocortisone in doses up to 200 mg daily for refractory shock."

Its use as a therapeutic guide for initiation of antibiotics in septic patients or as a way to determine the source of infection in critical illness has been studied with conflicting results. The most robust data have been shown when procalcitonin levels were used to guide antibiotic deescalation in patients with lower respiratory tract infection. Since the test would not help guide the management of this patient's refractory shock, it is not indicated."
