In most cases, the diagnosis is suggested by an absolute lymphocytosis on CBC with an abundance of predominantly mature-appearing lymphocytes on peripheral smear, characteristically associated with “smudge cells.” The diagnosis is confirmed by flow cytometry, which shows monoclonal B cells that usually co-express CD5 (typically a T-cell marker) along with the B-cell antigens CD19 and CD20.

These targeted agents were initially studied in patients with CLL who had relapsed or refractory disease, but studies now support their use as first-line therapy. At this time, despite the availability of many active agents and regimens, there is no evidence that earlier institution of therapy is associated with better outcomes. Many patients will go for years, and some indefinitely, without requiring therapy for their disease."
