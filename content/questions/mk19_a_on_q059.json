") to guide further management. Most cases of SVC syndrome are caused by malignancies with large mediastinal masses. Patients typically present with edema of the head, neck, and arms, often with cyanosis, plethora, and distended cutaneous collateral vessels. They may have headache, cough, dyspnea, hoarseness, or syncope. Most patients do not require emergency intervention. Treatment of patients presenting with SVC syndrome should be guided by the underlying malignancy. Although local therapies directed at mediastinal masses may yield symptomatic improvement, this may compromise treatment for the underlying disease. In this patient, the enlarged right supraclavicular lymph node is easily accessible for surgical biopsy with minimal risk. Many patients with SVC syndrome have highly chemotherapy-sensitive malignancies, such as small cell carcinoma of the lung or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Even those who present with a heavy burden of symptoms or vital sign abnormalities such as hypoxia may be treated with standard chemotherapy to obtain shrinkage of the tumor and improvement in SVC syndrome."
