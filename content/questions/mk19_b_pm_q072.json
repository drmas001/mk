"). This patient has features consistent with cardiogenic shock (cool extremities, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention, altered mental status, oliguria). Cardiogenic shock occurs when a primary cardiac insult causes decreased cardiac output. In addition to a physical examination, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends laboratory testing for myocardial ischemia and heart failure, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and transthoracic echocardiography. A transthoracic echocardiogram provides information on heart size, systolic and diastolic function, regional wall motion abnormalities, and valvular disease. Regional wall motion abnormalities suggest coronary artery disease, and changes in the myocardium can suggest conditions such as cardiac amyloid. Echocardiography may also provide prognostic information."

CT angiography has significantly improved the accuracy of evaluating pulmonary embolism and could be considered in this patient if the initial tests do not support myocardial infarction or other cardiac causes of this patient's shock. However, CT angiography would not be part of the initial battery of tests, and transporting this unstable patient would pose additional risk."
