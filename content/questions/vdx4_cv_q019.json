"The most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade. This ECG demonstrates electrical alternans, a shifting of the QRS axis with each beat related to a swinging motion of the heart within the pericardial fluid. It is most clearly seen in this tracing in lead I and the precordial leads. Electrical alternans and low voltage (not seen on this ECG) are suggestive of cardiac tamponade. Clinical signs of tamponade include tachycardia, hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and elevation of the jugular venous pulse. The ",
