"). This patient presents with a morbilliform rash 9 days after starting sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, a frequent cause of medication reactions. Exanthematous or morbilliform (measles-like) eruptions are the most common form of cutaneous drug reactions, most likely representing a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The rash appears during the first or second week after drug exposure, although subsequent exposures can produce a reaction much more quickly. Patients develop erythematous papules and macules that coalesce symmetrically to form plaques, beginning on the trunk and progressing distally across the limbs and usually sparing the palms and soles. The papules are often dense and monomorphic and are accompanied by varying degrees of pruritus. Lymphadenopathy is not uncommon. Treatment involves cessation of the causative agent, use of potent topical glucocorticoids, and oral H",

"), formerly called drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), is a severe life-threatening medication reaction. Symptoms begin with fever and flulike symptoms, which are quickly followed by burning skin pain and rash. The rash is typically a morbilliform exanthem that starts on the face and upper trunk and spreads distally.
