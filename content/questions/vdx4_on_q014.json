"This patient's colonoscopy findings are most consistent with radiation proctitis, likely resulting from his radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Although colonoscopy findings in patients with radiation proctitis may be nonspecific, the affected mucosa is frequently pale and friable, with extensive telangiectasia that may be a source of bleeding. In some patients, these colonoscopy findings may be less dramatic but still cause persistent bleeding. These changes are often in a segmental distribution, correlating with the region exposed to radiation, with an abrupt transition between injured and uninjured mucosa."
