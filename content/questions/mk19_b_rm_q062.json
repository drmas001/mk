", and a high-resolution CT scan that is typical for nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. Patients may also have usual interstitial pneumonitis. A usual interstitial pneumonitis pattern demonstrates honeycombing on high-resolution CT and is less responsive to therapy than nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. The 6-minute walk test provides a functional assessment; if oxygen desaturation of 88% or below occurs while the patient is walking, the patient is a candidate for home oxygen therapy. Some studies suggest that aggressive treatment of gastrointestinal reflux disease may have a positive effect on ILD progression. Mycophenolate mofetil is a mainstay of therapy for ILD in systemic sclerosis. Data from open-label trials suggest that mycophenolate mofetil can stabilize and, in some cases, improve lung function. The Scleroderma Lung Study II compared oral cyclophosphamide for 1 year to mycophenolate mofetil for 2 years. Both agents were equally efficacious in improving and stabilizing FVC; however, mycophenolate mofetil was better tolerated and can be used for many years, whereas cyclophosphamide has a time-limited utility due to toxicity. Expert opinion places mycophenolate mofetil first for both induction and maintenance therapy in patients with systemic sclerosis and ILD."
