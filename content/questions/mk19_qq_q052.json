") is the most appropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategy for this patient at average risk for colorectal cancer. Evidence from cohort studies demonstrated that colonoscopy reduces CRC-related mortality. Colonoscopy every 10 years is the longest screening interval of all recommended colorectal cancer screening tests. Harms include bleeding and perforation, both risks increasing with age. Other acceptable screening strategies include high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test every year; DNA-fecal immunochemical test every 1 to 3 years; CT colonography every 5 years; flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years; and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus fecal immunochemical testing every year. The most appropriate CRC screening strategy is the strategy the patient is most likely to adhere."

") is an appropriate screening test and interval for patients at increased risk for CRC. Patients at increased risk have a family history of CRC diagnosed in a first-degree relative at younger than 60 years or with two or more first-degree relatives at any age. In these patients, CRC screening should begin at age 40 years or 10 years earlier than the age of the youngest first-degree relative at diagnosis, whichever comes first. This patient has average risk for CRC and screening every 10 years with colonoscopy is appropriate."
