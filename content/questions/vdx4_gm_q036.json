"Viral conjunctivitis may occur as part of a viral prodrome, followed by adenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, and other symptoms and signs of upper respiratory tract infection; however, eye involvement may also be the only manifestation of viral infection. Patients may report a burning or gritty sensation in one eye and may believe that a mucoserous discharge represents a bacterial infection. Blurred vision may be present secondary to tearing in these patients, but visual acuity and pupillary reflexes are typically normal. Viral conjunctivitis tends to be highly infectious, commonly spreading to the other eye within 2 days. It is a self-limited process that resolves similarly to the common cold, with gradual resolution over several days without specific treatment."
