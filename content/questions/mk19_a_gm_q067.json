"). Chronic insomnia is diagnosed by the presence of symptoms that (1) cause substantial functional distress or impairment; (2) occur at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months; and (3) are not associated with other sleep, medical, or mental disorders. Multiple guidelines recommend cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the preferred therapy for chronic insomnia because of its effectiveness and safety. However, some patients will not improve with CBT-I, and others will decline to participate. In those situations, short-term pharmacologic therapy can be considered. Physicians should engage in a thorough shared decision-making process to decide whether to initiate pharmacologic therapy in patients with refractory insomnia. Pharmacologic therapy can be associated with harms, including daytime drowsiness, increased risk for falls and hip fracture, and medication-related hallucinations. The 2020 guideline from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense recommends low-dose doxepin or nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone) in this situation. Low-quality evidence shows improvement in subjective sleep latency, total sleep time, and sleep quality outcomes in patients receiving doxepin compared with placebo. For short-term use, there does not seem to be an increase in adverse events in patients taking doxepin compared with placebo."

"), is not recommended for chronic insomnia. Antihistamines are often used off-label as a sleep aid due to their sedating properties, but there are no data on their efficacy in treating chronic insomnia. In addition, because of their well-known anticholinergic effects, antihistamines may be associated with adverse drug events, particularly in elderly patients."
