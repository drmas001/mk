") is the most appropriate management. This patient's echocardiogram is consistent with severe secondary mitral regurgitation (MR). Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the most common cause of chronic secondary MR. Consequently, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is foundational in improving symptoms in patients such as this one. GDMT includes a Î²-blocker, an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and an aldosterone antagonist. Loop diuretics are used as needed. GDMT improves symptoms and prolongs life in patients with heart failure and probably does so when heart failure is complicated by chronic secondary MR. Current guidelines recommend GDMT as first-line therapy (class 1 recommendation) because it can reduce left ventricular volumes (reverse remodeling) in many patients and, in so doing, reduces severity of secondary MR."

Among patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less and sinus rhythm, CRT is indicated in those with left bundle branch block, New York Heart Association functional class II to ambulatory class IV heart failure symptoms, and a QRS duration of 150 ms or longer despite GDMT. In addition, in patients with an LVEF of 35% or less and a QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms, CRT may be useful. This patient now has New York Heart Association functional class I symptoms with an LVEF greater than 35% and therefore does not qualify for CRT."
