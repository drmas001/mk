"). This patient has premature ejaculation, which is defined as ejaculation with minimal stimulation that occurs earlier than desired. Premature ejaculation that causes self-reported psychological distress in the patient or partner is an indication for treatment. The diagnosis of premature ejaculation is solely based on history. Clinicians should obtain a thorough sexual history (frequency of premature ejaculation, antecedent sexual activities, aggravating and alleviating factors, the impact of premature ejaculation, and any concomitant erectile dysfunction). Assessment for an underlying mood condition is also imperative, given the association between premature ejaculation and development of poor self-esteem and depression. Although the specific pathophysiologic mechanism of premature ejaculation is unknown, dysfunction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors and penile hypersensitivity are believed to be involved. Paroxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line therapy and are the most appropriate pharmacologic management option for this patient. A meta-analysis of available trials suggests that paroxetine may be the most effective SSRI. Complete therapeutic response typically occurs within 2 to 3 weeks of continuous use. Owing to upregulation of 5-HT receptors, therapeutic benefit may decline after 6 to 12 months. The combination of a SSRI plus a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor may be the most effective treatment for premature ejaculation but is associated with more side effects than monotherapies."

"), a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with serotonergic activity, is effective for premature ejaculation. It is considered second-line therapy, however, because TCAs have more side effects than SSRIs. Clomipramine can be used when SSRIs are either ineffective or not tolerated, but it would be inappropriate to initiate clomipramine in this patient before a trial of paroxetine."

") should not be considered in place of starting fluoxetine. The squeeze technique involves squeezing the glans of the penis when nearing orgasm until the urge to ejaculate subsides. Developed in the 1950s, the start-stop technique involves stimulating the penis until the patient feels the urge to ejaculate and then stopping until the urge subsides. This process is repeated multiple times until ejaculation. Although initial studies suggested that both methods were effective, subsequent evidence has been less convincing."
