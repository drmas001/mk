") is associated with the highest likelihood of ambulation. Spinal cord compression occurs in 2.5% of patients with metastatic cancer and may impair lower extremity strength and ambulation. The most common types of cancer that cause epidural spinal cord compression in adults are lung, breast, and prostate cancer, as well as myeloma and lymphoma. Approximately 85% of epidural spinal cord compression cases are caused by epidural extension from vertebral body metastases. Lymphomas are more likely to involve a paraspinal mass that extends through the neural foramina to cause cord compression. Pain, often worse with recumbency, is present in more than 80% of patients and usually precedes neurologic symptoms by several weeks. The patient's neurologic status at diagnosis is the most important predictor of outcome. Of patients who are able to walk when starting treatment, 80% remain ambulatory; however, less than 20% of nonambulatory patients regain the ability to walk. Spinal cord compression from metastatic disease requires emergent use of high-dose glucocorticoids and urgent surgical decompression, followed by irradiation for most tumor types."
