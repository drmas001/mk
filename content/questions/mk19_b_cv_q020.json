History is notable only for hypertension treated with amlodipine; she takes no other medications. Aspirin, intravenous unfractionated heparin, and metoprolol are initiated."

") is the most appropriate additional management for this patient with probable unstable angina, a form of non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Early clopidogrel loading has been recommended in patients with ACS regardless of reperfusion or revascularization strategy. In patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of NSTE-ACS, risk assessment is indicated to select the treatment strategy. Several risk criteria and scores are available. The TIMI risk score includes seven independent predictors for death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or ischemia requiring revascularization at 14 days, with 1 point assigned for each of these predictors: age 65 years or older, three or more coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors (cholesterol, family history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking), previously documented CAD (angiographic stenosis >50%), aspirin use in the past 7 days, two or more ischemic episodes in the past 24 hours, ST-segment deviation on ECG, and elevated cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase-MB or troponin). This patient presents with features consistent with possible ACS but has a TIMI score of 1 and is clinically stable. Low-risk patients undergo noninvasive stress testing with left ventricular function assessment before hospital discharge. Cardiac catheterization is reserved for patients with active or intermittent ischemia, including those with angina despite medical therapy or evidence of ischemia on stress testing, and patients at very high clinical risk based on risk score. The ischemia-guided approach is appropriate for low-risk patients (TIMI score <2), particularly low-risk women, who may have worse outcomes with an early invasive approach."
