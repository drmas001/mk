Kidney and bladder ultrasonography is helpful in patients with a high pretest probability of urinary tract obstruction and in patients with AKI of unknown etiology. Because relief of obstruction can reverse kidney injury and prevent chronic damage, timely diagnosis is essential. Urinary obstruction can be asymptomatic and can be associated with no noted change in urine output. Because of the lack of definitive symptoms on presentation, kidney imaging, typically ultrasonography, should be considered for all patients with AKI, but most particularly when risk factors for obstruction are present. Medical history findings (including pelvic tumors or irradiation, congenital urinary tract abnormalities, kidney stones, genitourinary infections, various procedures or surgeries, and prostatic enlargement) should increase suspicion for obstruction."
