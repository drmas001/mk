"Xerotic eczema (also called asteatotic eczema, winter itch, or eczema craquel√©) usually occurs on the anterior shins of older persons with dry skin. Affected skin is often red, invariably dry, and cracked, with multiple fine fissures that resemble cracks in porcelain, also described as a \"dried riverbed\" appearance. The dermatitis is an isolated finding more common in winter or in dry conditions. Aging is the most common cause; rarely, it may occur in association with an underlying condition, such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, and malignancy, or as an adverse effect of certain drugs (e.g., retinoids, diuretics, antineoplastic agents)."
