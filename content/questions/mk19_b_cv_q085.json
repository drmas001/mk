") is the most appropriate test to perform in this patient with new-onset heart failure of unclear cause. Echocardiography should be performed initially in all patients with new heart failure; this patient's echocardiogram is notable for a low ejection fraction, anterior wall hypokinesis, and absence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The anterior wall motion abnormality increases suspicion for coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common underlying cause of heart failure. The patient also has exertional chest heaviness; thus, clinical suspicion for CAD should be high. Cardiac catheterization offers the most direct information about coronary anatomy and therefore is the best method for assessing ischemia in such patients. If the patient has CAD, revascularization has been associated with improved survival rates and often with improved ejection fraction."

") would be reasonable to perform after echocardiography and after CAD has been excluded. CMR imaging can help identify infiltrative processes, such as sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, Fabry disease, or endomyocardial fibrosis, and has distinct imaging patterns that can suggest the diagnosis of myocarditis. CMR imaging is also becoming more widely used to evaluate for ischemia and hibernating myocardium, but guidelines recommend either stress testing or cardiac catheterization as the first study in the evaluation of possible ischemic cardiomyopathy."
