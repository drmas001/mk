Acetaminophen has established efficacy only in migraine of mild to moderate intensity; data suggest the response may be enhanced by coadministration with metoclopramide. Aspirin administered alone or in combination with acetaminophen and caffeine also has established efficacy in acute migraine. The effectiveness of the NSAIDs ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and diclofenac potassium is supported by strong evidence."

They should be used sparingly and only when more appropriate acute therapies are contraindicated."

"), are migraine-specific selective agonists at 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B and 1D receptors. These drugs inhibit the release of calcitonin geneâ€“related peptide, which mediates cerebral vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation, and pain sensitization of migraine. Guidelines recommend the use of triptans in patients with moderate to severe migraine who have not responded to NSAID therapy over a series of at least three migraine attacks. Current evidence suggests that all oral triptans possess nearly similar clinical efficacy."
