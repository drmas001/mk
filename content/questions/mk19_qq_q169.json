"). The most life-threatening acute complication of diabetes mellitus is DKA, which mostly affects patients with type 1 diabetes younger than 65 years and is sometimes its presenting manifestation. DKA is associated with hyperglycemia (350-1000 mg/dL [19.4-56 mmol/L]) and must be treated early and aggressively to avoid life-threatening consequences caused by dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. At presentation, patients with DKA usually report a several-day history of polyuria, polydipsia, and blurred vision, culminating in nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and altered mental status. Physical examination typically reveals deep, labored breathing (Kussmaul respirations); a fruity odor to the breath (from acetone); poor skin turgor; tachycardia; and hypotension. This complication may occur as a result of precipitating acute stresses, such as infections (influenza, pneumonia, or gastroenteritis) or acute myocardial infarction; in patients with insulin pumps, when a technical interruption of insulin infusion occurs; and in patients who are nonadherent to their medication regimen. In almost all instances, DKA is entirely preventable if patients practice regular glucose monitoring and understand the need for increased insulin doses during acute stress events. The diagnosis of DKA is typically based on a blood glucose level greater than 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L), increased anion gap metabolic acidosis (arterial pH <7.3), a serum bicarbonate level of 18 mEq/L (18 mmol/L) or less, and presence of serum or urine ketones."
