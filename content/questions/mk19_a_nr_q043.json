"). One tool used to categorize dementia into levels of severity is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Mild dementia is often associated with a MMSE score of 20 to 23, moderate dementia a score of 10 to 19, and severe dementia a score <10. This patient is in a mild stage of dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD), given her abnormal test score and her functional dependence with her finances. AD is the most common memory-predominant dementia and is also the most common cause of dementia. The typical presentation of AD is that of an insidious worsening of memory, language, and visuospatial abilities. Manifestations include forgetfulness, frequent repetition of questions or statements, word-finding difficulties, hesitation in speech, and navigational problems. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are approved for treating mild-to-moderate dementia in patients with AD and have demonstrated modest benefits in cognitive performance, stabilizing progression of symptoms, and functional loss. Because of their possible adverse effects on conduction, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be used with caution or avoided in patients with bradycardia or other conduction abnormalities. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal issues, which result in discontinuation of the medication in nearly 20% of patients. Additional adverse effects include syncope, agitation, nocturnal cramps, and vivid dreams. Donepezil should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures."
