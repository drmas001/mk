Lesions may be found on the nose, eyelid, and forehead and may result in ophthalmologic complications, such as keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, and acute retinal necrosis. When grouped vesicles on an erythematous base involve the V1 distribution or extend to the tip of the nose, concurrent management with an ophthalmologist is indicated to help prevent or treat these complications. Management of these patients usually involves antiviral therapy and topical glucocorticoid eye drops to reduce inflammation."

"All adults aged 50 years or older, including those with a previous episode of zoster, should receive the recombinant (inactivated) herpes zoster vaccine to reduce the incidence of zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. Patients aged 19 to 49 years who are immunocompromised because of disease or therapy should also be vaccinated. The timing of vaccine administration after an episode of herpes zoster is debated. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices states that there is no specific amount of time but does advise waiting until the rash has resolved. Other experts recommend deferring vaccination for 1 year after an episode in immunocompetent patients, because the cellular immune response is already primed by the recent episode of herpes zoster.
