"). According to an algorithm from the CDC, this screening test was a false positive. Fourth generation HIV testing uses a combination assay for HIV antibody and HIV p24 antigen, which detects acute infection at least 1 week earlier than older assays. A positive result on the combination assay leads to testing with an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, which, if positive, confirms infection. Specimens that test positive on the initial combination assay but negative for HIV antibody are tested for HIV RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing; if positive, acute HIV infection is confirmed, and a negative result identifies a false-positive HIV antibody and HIV p24 combination assay. Although the initial combination assay has a 99.6% specificity, testing in low prevalence populations can result in false positives, so waiting for the results of the confirmatory antibody differentiation immunoassay and nucleic acid amplification testing is important. This patient does not have HIV infection, and safe sexual practice counseling should be reinforced."
