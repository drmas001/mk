"). Acute rhinosinusitis is most commonly caused by viral infections; a bacterial cause is found in only a small percentage of patients. Acute rhinosinusitis is characterized by symptoms of nasal congestion and obstruction; facial pain, pressure, and fullness that generally worsen when bending forward; headache; fever; purulent nasal discharge; and maxillary tooth pain. When caused by viral infection, fever may be present within the first 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset and is often associated with other symptoms, such as myalgia and fatigue, but temperature normalizes afterward. Bacterial sinusitis is more likely if there are severe symptoms associated with a high fever for at least 3 or 4 consecutive days after onset of illness or if symptoms are persistent (lasting >10 days). Initial treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is focused on symptom relief with analgesics, intranasal glucocorticoids, and nasal saline irrigation. Oral decongestants are not effective except in cases where eustachian tube dysfunction is present. Intranasal decongestants are not efficacious, neither are oral or intranasal antihistamines."

"Antibiotics are not indicated in this patient at this time. Over 90% of cases of acute sinusitis are viral in origin. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with persistent and severe symptoms (such as high fever and marked facial pain), progressively worsening symptoms, or no improvement after 10 days of supportive care. If antibiotics are indicated, both amoxicillin-clavulanate and doxycycline would be appropriate first-line agents. Although this patient has purulent nasal discharge and fever, the acute nature of the symptoms makes antibiotics inappropriate at this time.
