However, findings on serum rapid plasma reagin testing are frequently negative in primary syphilis. Treatment of primary syphilis with a single injection of intramuscular benzathine penicillin is recommended. Without treatment, primary lesions will spontaneously regress within 3 to 6 weeks before the disease moves into later stages. This patient should be offered HIV testing, screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and counseling on risk reduction. In addition to syphilis, the differential diagnosis of genital ulcer disease includes chancroid and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Secondary bacterial infection of traumatic genital lesions may also have the appearance of an ulcer."
