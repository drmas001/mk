Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes may be at higher risk for hepatitis B virus infection because of contact with equipment that contains infected blood, such as unsterile needles or blood glucose monitoring devices. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends universal hepatitis B vaccination for all adults aged 19 through 59 years as well as for patients aged 60 years or older who are at increased risk for hepatitis B virus infection. Medical conditions and/or situations that confer increased risk include chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexual exposure, current or recent injection drug use, percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood (including patients with diabetes), incarceration, and travel to countries with hepatitis B endemicity. The ACIP also recommends pneumococcal vaccination and annual influenza vaccination for patients with diabetes because they are at higher risk for severe infections. This patient is up to date with these vaccinations."
