"), which involves the entire epidermis and penetrates into, but not through, the dermis. Because the epidermal layer is lost, the wound forms a blister or weeps interstitial fluid. The wound blanches with pressure and is painful to air, temperature, and pressure because the vessels and nerve of the dermis are still intact, unlike the case with second-degree, deep partial-thickness burns and third-degree burns. Healing occurs through re-epithelialization. Wound care for second-degree, partial-thickness burns includes cleaning the wound with soap and water and applying a topical antibiotic ointment. Specialized wound dressing will maintain a moist environment and may remain in place for several days after the injury. Surgical excision and skin grafting should be considered for wounds that do not re-epithelialize after 2 to 3 weeks."
