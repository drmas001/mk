This patient demonstrates multiple episodes of a systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever, abdominal pain, rash, and arthritis, each lasting only several days.

" gene. This gene encodes pyrin, a protein important to the production and/or overproduction of interleukin-1β. Although the genetics continue to be studied, from a clinical point of view the disease is most commonly found in Jewish, Arab, and Turkish populations and follows an autosomal recessive pattern. Other symptoms may include other forms of serositis, including pericarditis. During episodes, inflammatory markers are elevated; in between episodes the physical examination and laboratory results may be normal. Diagnosis is made clinically and can be confirmed definitively in most patients through genetic testing. One long-term consequence of the episodic inflammation of FMF is amyloidosis, including of the kidneys; this patient's low-level proteinuria may be an early manifestation. Other autoinflammatory syndromes are rarer and have similar but nonidentical features that allow them to be distinguished from FMF. First-line treatment of FMF is lifelong daily prophylaxis with colchicine, which in most cases prevents attacks, prevents renal amyloidosis, and can inhibit neutrophils and suppress interleukin-1β generation."

However, canakinumab is expensive and immunosuppressive and has not been FDA approved for FMF treatment. Given the long experience with colchicine and its efficacy, canakinumab should be reserved for patients with FMF in whom colchicine has failed or is not tolerated."
