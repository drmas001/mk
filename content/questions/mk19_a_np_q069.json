") for this pregnant patient with likely nephrolithiasis. Imaging is indicated for diagnosis and to guide management based on stone size and location. Ultrasonography is increasingly being used as an initial diagnostic study. Although less sensitive than CT for nephrolithiasis, particularly for detecting small stones and ureteral stones, ultrasonography does not expose patients to radiation and is typically more readily available and has a lower cost compared with CT; it is also the preferred modality during pregnancy. A positive ultrasound may therefore be adequate for initial diagnosis in patients with a typical presentation for kidney stones; more complex testing is indicated for those with a high clinical suspicion but a nondiagnostic ultrasound or a more complicated clinical presentation."

Although CT is more sensitive and specific than ultrasonography, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated equivalent diagnostic accuracy within the emergency department. Finally, CT is associated with significant radiation exposure and is contraindicated in pregnant women."

Although this procedure does not involve radiation, it is not a diagnostic procedure indicated for suspected kidney stones because it is unnecessarily invasive."
