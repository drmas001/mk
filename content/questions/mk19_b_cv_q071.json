" with or without right bundle branch block. Brugada syndrome is the association of Brugada pattern with ventricular fibrillation, arrhythmogenic syncope, or cardiac arrest. Brugada syndrome has an increased prevalence in men and persons of Asian descent. Arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death, in patients with Brugada syndrome are more common at night, during sleep. Abnormalities on ECG may be intermittent and may be elicited by fever or pharmacologic challenge with sodium channel blockade, such as procainamide infusion. The presence of Brugada pattern on ECG, an unexplained syncopal event, and relevant family history (father who died in his sleep at age 45 years) are highly suggestive of Brugada syndrome."
