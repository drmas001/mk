"A 59-year-old woman is evaluated for long-standing chronic pain due to rheumatoid arthritis associated with reduced overall functional status. She is in regular follow-up with a rheumatologist and a pain medicine specialist. She recently started immediate-release oxycodone at a daily dose equal to 22.5 morphine milligram equivalents. Her Opioid Risk Tool score was 2, indicating low risk for future opioid abuse. In addition to oxycodone, she takes meloxicam, etanercept, topical diclofenac, duloxetine, prednisone, and acetaminophen."

"). Review of the prescription monitoring database before authorizing refills allows the prescribing clinician to monitor patient use patterns and identify requests for early refills as a warning sign of worsening pain or disordered use. It also serves an important function in identifying multiple prescriptions of opioids and other controlled substances. For this patient with chronic pain who has several specialists involved in her care, close monitoring of the database is needed before each prescription. The regulations for checking prescription monitoring databases before opioid prescribing vary by state, and physicians should be familiar with the regulations in the states in which they practice."
