"). This patient has focal dystonia of the vocal cords, also known as laryngeal dystonia or vocal cord spasmodic dysphonia. Dystonia is characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions that are slow, repetitive, and directional. It can be generalized or focal and can involve isolated body parts, such as the vocal cords, face, or neck. In this patient, persistent worsening of movements with certain sounds, resolution of spasms with different tasks (such as singing), and direct observation of slow and sustained pulling of vocal cords support a diagnosis of dystonia."

This patient's symptoms are not variable or inconsistent, and observation of involuntary movements of vocal cords in a pattern typical for dystonia rules out functional disorder. Dystonia is sometimes misdiagnosed as a functional disorder because of clinical features, such as task dependency or sensory tricks (difficulty speaking but ability to sing and movement or touch that interrupts dystonia, also known as geste antagoniste)."

In this patient, the absence of these features and sustained pulling on direct observation make tics an unlikely diagnosis."
