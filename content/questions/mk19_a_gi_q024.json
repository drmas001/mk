"). Gastric varices occur in up to 20% of patients with cirrhosis and can be challenging to manage. Typically, octreotide is administered to reduce portal pressures, and antibiotics are provided to reduce risk for infectious complications of gastrointestinal bleeding. These complications include bacteremia, which can increase morbidity and mortality from variceal bleeding. Treatment options for gastric varices along the greater curvature of the stomach depend on the anatomy of the abdominal vasculature. For isolated gastric varices due to splenic vein thrombosis, splenectomy can be performed to decompress varices. If the portal vein is patent and a suitable splenorenal shunt is available, balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration of varices can be considered. If the anatomy of the hepatic veins and portal vein branches is favorable, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may be an option. To determine the best therapy, contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging is required. Therefore, abdominal CT with contrast is the best next action."

"Gastric fundal varices are much more frequent in patients with portal vein and/or splenic vein thrombosis, and the finding of these varices should prompt cross-sectional imaging to investigate the presence of such thromboses. Endovascular obliteration is an option in patients with a large gastro- or splenorenal collateral; therefore, cross-sectional vascular imaging with contrast-enhanced CT is preferred over abdominal ultrasonography (",

Band ligation is effective in these types of varices because of their predictable anatomy and more superficial location, which permits thorough eradication. In this patient, band ligation is not a good option because varices in the gastric fundus are not amenable to this approach."
