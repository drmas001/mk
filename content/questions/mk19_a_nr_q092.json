"A 38-year-old woman is evaluated for a 2-year history of headache. Headache episodes occur three times per month, each lasting approximately 8 hours and sometimes up to 3 days. She describes midfrontal pressure that spreads bilaterally and becomes both stabbing and throbbing over 1 to 2 hours, worsening with her usual activities and becoming so severe that she must lie down. Headaches are occasionally accompanied by nausea and nasal congestion but no visual or neurologic symptoms. Combined naproxen-pseudoephedrine provides partial symptom relief."

"). Migraine is the most common severe headache in both population-based and clinic-based studies. Annual prevalence for migraine approximates 13% of adults, and greater than 90% of headache visits to primary care and specialty settings involve migraine. According to criteria published in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, migraine involves recurrent attacks (at least 5 lifetime) of head pain lasting, without treatment, from 4 to 72 hours. The pain of migraine involves at least two of four features (unilateral location, throbbing nature, moderate to severe intensity, worsening with routine physical activity) and is associated with at least one of two features: (1) nausea and/or vomiting and (2) photophobia and phonophobia. Neurologic examination is typically normal. Migraine may be subclassified qualitatively (with or without aura) and quantitatively (episodic or chronic). Migraine in patients reporting visual or neurologic symptoms meeting appropriate criteria will be subclassified as migraine with aura, but very few patients with migraine will ever experience aura. The number of total headache days per month differentiates episodic (<15 days) from chronic (15 or more days) migraine. Because of the extensive phenotypic variation, nearly half of migraine presentations are misdiagnosed. Neck pain (75%) and “sinus” symptoms, such as tearing or nasal drainage (50%), are both more common than features felt to be characteristic of migraine, such as vomiting or aura."

Indomethacin can be helpful during cycles of more frequent attacks."
