Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block is typified by intermittent nonconducted P waves with unchanging PR intervals. Dizziness and syncope are major symptoms. Mobitz type 2 AV block usually occurs below the AV node and has a higher risk for progression to third-degree (complete) heart block. Regardless of symptoms, permanent pacing is indicated for second-degree Mobitz type 2 AV block, high-grade AV block, and third-degree AV block not attributable to reversible causes."

In the absence of bradycardia, Mobitz type 1 AV block may be suggested by an irregular pulse. There are few other physical examination findings."
