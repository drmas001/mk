"). This patient has melasma, also known as chloasma, or the mask of pregnancy. Melasma is a hyperpigmentation disorder resulting in tan to dark brown reticulated patches, mostly on the sun-exposed areas on the face (malar, mandibular, and centrofacial regions, including the forehead) and the upper extremities. It is exacerbated with sun exposure. Melasma most commonly affects women of childbearing age; it occurs more frequently and is more noticeable in patients with darker skin. Causes of melasma are hormonal factors (pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives), ultraviolet (UV) light, and genetic predisposition. The most essential element of management of melasma is strict sun protection with sun avoidance, use of sunscreen, and wearing sun-protective clothing. Melasma can occasionally resolve after pregnancy or with cessation of oral contraceptive use but may persist or recur with UV light exposure. Treatment is challenging and, in addition to strict sun protection and avoidance, involves topical depigmenting agents, such as hydroquinone. Laser therapy; chemical peels; and oral agents, such as tranexamic acid, are other treatment options. It may take months to years for pigmentation to normalize."

") is a low-potency glucocorticoid. When combined with tretinoin and hydroquinone, topical glucocorticoids have shown some efficacy in the treatment of melasma. Monotherapy with topical glucocorticoids for melasma is not recommended and would not be the correct management in this patient. Long-term use of topical glucocorticoids on the face additionally increases the risk for skin atrophy."
