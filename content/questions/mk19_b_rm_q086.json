Physical examination shows swelling with warmth and redness, as well as tenderness with palpation and limited range of motion. The differential diagnosis of acute monoarthritis includes crystal-induced disease (gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition), infection, and hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint). Joint aspiration is necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and distinguish among these causes. Synovial fluid should be analyzed for cell count and differential, crystal examination, Gram stain, and culture."

") is not helpful for determining the cause of this patient's acute monoarthritis. Although an elevated level might increase clinical suspicion of gout as the cause, only knee aspiration with fluid analysis for cell count and crystals can determine the cause of the knee inflammation. The presence of sodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid polymorphonuclear cells is diagnostic for gout. Gout and infection may coexist, so aspiration would be indicated even if the serum urate level was elevated. Finally, even in patients with acute gout, serum urate level may be normal at the time of the flare. Thus, a normal serum urate level would not rule out gout as the cause of acute monoarthritis."
