"). Pulse oximetry calculates the differential between absorption of infrared light by oxygenated and deoxygenated blood and is widely used to monitor oxygenation. Conventional probes used on the finger, toe, and earlobe rely on transmission technology, utilizing emitting and detecting sensors applied on opposing sides of the digit or earlobe. Inaccurate readings can be caused by vasoconstriction, low perfusion states, skin pigmentation, motion artifact, or nail polish. The clinician should examine the pulse oximeter waveform to determine if the reading is accurate; a normal signal shows a sharp waveform with a clear dicrotic notch. The absence of a clear dicrotic notch suggests the device is not providing an accurate reading. In a patient with Raynaud phenomenon and clinical signs of peripheral vasoconstriction, pulse oximetry with a finger probe is likely to be erroneous. Options include changing to an earlobe probe or use of reflectance technology with a forehead probe in which the emitter and detector sensors are adjacent to each other."
