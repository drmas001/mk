"), given joint involvement that is polyarticular and includes the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, both hands are usually involved, and, if MCP joints on one hand are tender and swollen, there are usually MCP joints on the other hand (although not always the same digits on each side) that are symptomatic and abnormal on physical examination as well. Other frequently involved joints are the proximal interphalangeal joints and wrists. Corresponding joints in the feet (interphalangeal joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, and ankles) are also often affected."

In contrast to other forms of spondyloarthritis, sacroiliac joint involvement is considered an essential feature of ankylosing spondylitis. About one third of patients develop hip joint involvement, and about one third develop peripheral arthritis elsewhere, often in the shoulders but not the MCP joints."

Erosive arthritis does not involve the MCP joints."

Arthritis is asymmetric and may be monoarticular or oligoarticular; joints commonly affected include the knee, ankle, and wrist. Enthesitis is especially common; Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis occur in up to 90% of cases. Dactylitis can also occur. The spine and sacroiliac joints are less commonly involved. Symmetric involvement of the MCP joints is not characteristic of reactive arthritis."
