") is appropriate for this patient with stage 2 hypertension, which is defined as a systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 mm Hg or higher and/or a diastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or higher. There is general agreement among hypertension societies that a single agent, such as chlorthalidone, losartan, or nifedipine (",
{
"type":"tag",
"tagName":"b",
"attrs":{
},

"), is unlikely to control BP in patients with BP 20/10 mm Hg above target. Given this patient's degree of hypertension, it is unlikely that a single agent will achieve her treatment goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Therefore, continued therapeutic lifestyle interventions and combination drug therapy are indicated. In this circumstance, initial therapy may include a combination of two agents from two different classes of antihypertensive drugs, either separately or in a fixed-dose pill. A combination of two agents at moderate doses is often more successful at achieving BP goals than one BP agent at maximal dose and minimizes the adverse effects that are more commonly noted at higher doses. Guidelines recommend that drug combinations with similar mechanisms of action or clinical effects should be avoided. For example, two drugs from the same class should not be administered together (e.g., two different Î²-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers). Likewise, two drugs from classes that target the same BP control system are less effective and potentially harmful when used together (e.g., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers). Exceptions to this rule include concomitant use of a thiazide diuretic, potassium-sparing diuretic, and/or loop diuretic in various combinations. Also, dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be combined. Combined use of any renin-angiotensin system drug classes (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors) is harmful; several clinical trials have revealed more adverse events with these combinations (hyperkalemia, hypotension, acute kidney injury), without additional cardiovascular or kidney benefits."
