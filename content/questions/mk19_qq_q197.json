"). This patient has a moderate probability of having a pulmonary embolism (PE) as assessed by one of the validated risk stratification systems (Wells score). Using the Wells risk stratification tool, this patient has a score of 6 (heart rate >100/min, previously documented deep venous thrombosis [DVT] or PE, and PE as the most likely diagnosis). Therefore, the diagnosis of PE should be pursued by further definitive testing. In this patient, CTA is the preferred method of diagnosis given her lack of contraindications to this study. CTA findings of filling defects within the segmental or larger pulmonary arteries are specific for PE. Relative contraindications for CTA include kidney failure and contrast allergy."

This patient has at least a moderate risk for PE, and calculation of the PERC score is not indicated."
