"). Preoperative laboratory testing is primarily driven by patient-related factors. Overtesting in the preoperative period is common and leads to higher costs and additional downstream testing, which can cause harm. Preoperative hemoglobin testing is indicated in a patient with signs or symptoms suggestive of anemia, recent blood loss, use of medications that could affect hematopoiesis, or anticipated significant blood loss. Patient-related factors that may drive preoperative serum creatinine testing include hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiac disease, and medications that affect kidney function. Total hip arthroplasty is associated with significant blood loss, and establishing the patient's baseline hemoglobin level will be helpful. This patient has hypertension and is taking lisinopril, both of which can alter kidney function, and serum creatinine measurement is indicated."
