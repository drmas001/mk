") is indicated to evaluate this patient for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Because moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) may go undetected by dipstick, direct quantification of albuminuria and/or proteinuria using a random (spot) protein-creatinine ratio or albumin-creatinine ratio or a 24-hour urine collection is required in high-risk patients. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with increased risk for CKD, and testing for albuminuria is appropriate. The National Kidney Foundation and the American Diabetes Association recommend annual testing to assess urine albumin excretion in patients with type 1 DM of 5 years' duration and in all patients with type 2 DM starting at the time of diagnosis by measuring the urine albumin-creatinine ratio. Moderately increased albuminuria is defined as an albumin-creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g to 300 mg/g; diagnosis requires an elevated albumin-creatinine ratio on two of three random samples obtained over 6 months. Patients with DM and moderately increased albuminuria are at increased risk for progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers delays CKD progression in patients with proteinuric kidney disease or in patients with DM and moderately increased albuminuria, underscoring the importance of early detection."

"). However, this test is cumbersome and unreliable if not collected correctly. Patients have a difficult time accurately collecting and storing urine for 24 hours. Therefore, obtaining urine ratios on random urine samples is recommended as an alternative method of estimating proteinuria in the clinical assessment of kidney disease. Furthermore, a 24-hour urine collection may not diagnose moderately increased albuminuria. Finally, screening for CKD 5 years after the diagnosis of DM is appropriate for type 1 DM but not in this patient with type 2 DM; screening should be initiated at the time of diagnosis."

"). Cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells, freely filtered by glomeruli, and catabolized by tubules. Compared with serum creatinine, serum cystatin C levels are less affected by age, sex, or muscle mass. Changes in serum cystatin C may identify small decreases in kidney function better than serum creatinine. Formulas using cystatin C to estimate GFR are helpful for patients in whom creatinine-based GFR may be inaccurate."
