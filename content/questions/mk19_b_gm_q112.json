The history should include assessment for risk factors, including swimming/water activities, trauma/injury, associated skin conditions (including contact dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis), immunocompromising conditions (such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, or cancer chemotherapy), history of radiation, and tympanostomy tubes or perforation of the tympanic membrane, which may alter choice of treatment. On physical examination, the classic sign of AOE is tenderness with pushing on the tragus or pulling on the pinna. Topical treatments, including antibiotics, glucocorticoids, antiseptics (acetic acid), and combination therapies, are first-line management for uncomplicated AOE. In this patient with moderate-severity disease characterized by pain and occlusion of the ear canal with debris (cerumen, desquamated cells, purulent material), a topical antibiotic/glucocorticoid combination is reasonable after cleaning out the debris from the ear canal. Patients should be instructed on proper technique for instillation of ear drops, including cleaning excess debris before instilling the drops and then lying down with the affected ear facing upward, remaining in this position for 3 to 5 minutes."
