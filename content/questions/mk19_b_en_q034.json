") after 2 to 5 days of biotin discontinuation. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin commonly found in over-the-counter dietary supplements. High circulating levels of biotin have been shown to interfere with laboratory assays that use streptavidin-biotin as an immobilizing system. Biotin interference causes falsely high results with competitive immunoassays used to measure small molecules, including free thyroxine (T",

"; it also causes falsely low results with sandwich assays used to measure large molecules such as thyroid-stimulating hormone. This interference results in a testing profile that mimics thyrotoxicosis. Biotin is a popular dietary supplement and is also used to treat multiple sclerosis and other neuromuscular disorders. Although biotin is also found in plants, the richest sources are liver, egg yolk, soybeans, and yeast. An adequate intake for adults is estimated to be 30 μg/d. Larger doses are commonly taken as an adjunctive medical treatment or for their perceived health benefits. Most case reports of biotin interference with thyroid function assays document biotin doses of 300 mg/d or higher, although interference with 10 mg/d has also been reported. Interference with thyroid assay results typically resolves within 48 hours, but expert opinion recommends testing after stopping biotin for several days."

Thyroidectomy is not first-line therapy for most patients, and it not indicated in this patient without a confirmed diagnosis of Graves disease."
