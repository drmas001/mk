"). The patient has chronic pancreatitis. Long-term tobacco use is an independent risk factor for acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic cancer. It is synergistic with alcohol in promoting morbidity related to pancreatic disease. Initial therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain should entail lifestyle modification, including alcohol and tobacco cessation, and simple analgesics. No direct evidence addresses whether alcohol cessation alters the natural history of chronic pancreatitis pain. However, several case series have suggested that discontinuing alcohol use improves the pain in chronic pancreatitis but does not necessarily alter the progression to endocrine or exocrine dysfunction. There is no direct evidence that smoking cessation is beneficial in improving the natural history of chronic pancreatitis. However, case series have shown a decrease in the amount of pancreatic calcification progression when smoking cessation occurs at the time of diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Both alcohol and smoking cessation are strongly recommended in the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guideline on chronic pancreatitis. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline may reduce pain from neuropathic conditions and therefore may be useful in patients with chronic pancreatitis. ACG makes no recommendation for or against these drug therapies in patients with chronic pancreatitis."
