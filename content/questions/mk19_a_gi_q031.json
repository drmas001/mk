"A 57-year-old woman is evaluated in the emergency department for a 9-month history of increasing abdominal pain that has worsened in the past week. After a total knee replacement 9 months ago, postoperative pain was managed with oxycodone. During this time she developed bilateral lower abdominal pain and constipation. Her constipation has improved with polyethylene glycol, but the abdominal pain continued to increase and is now diffuse and near-constant. Three days ago, she increased the frequency of oxycodone from three times daily to four times daily, and the abdominal pain intensified in frequency and severity. Despite this current level of pain, the patient is adamant that the only thing that helps her pain is oxycodone."

"). The patient has progressively severe abdominal pain that requires escalating narcotic doses. The paradoxical worsening of her pain despite dose escalation is consistent with narcotic bowel syndrome, also known as opiate-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia. The proposed cause of narcotic bowel syndrome is centrally mediated opioid-induced hyperalgesia, but the pathophysiological mechanism is not well defined. The condition is characterized by a patient's fear of tapering narcotics; however, the only effective treatment is complete cessation of narcotic use, which is most successfully achieved in a supervised detoxification program. During the detoxification process, nonpharmacologic therapies, such as stress reduction and exercise, are introduced and adjuvant treatments with nonopioid analgesics, such as antidepressants, are added. Psychotherapy may be beneficial."
