"A 74-year-old man is evaluated for shortness of breath that occurs when walking around the house and occasionally when getting dressed. History is significant for ischemic cardiomyopathy and three heart failure hospitalizations over the past 6 months. He was treated for colon cancer 2 years ago; there is no evidence of recurrence. He has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Medications are lisinopril, high-dose furosemide, and spironolactone. He previously took carvedilol and isosorbide dinitrate–hydralazine, which were discontinued because of symptomatic hypotension."

"). LVADs are reasonable either as a bridge to heart transplant or as primary therapy in patients with advanced heart failure. Survival at 1 year is near the survival after heart transplant, and an LVAD would be worth considering in patients who have several markers of increased mortality. This patient has advanced heart failure with several risk factors for an increase in mortality over the next 2 years. These risk factors include several heart failure hospitalizations, worsening kidney function, low serum sodium level, high diuretic dosage, and inability to tolerate usual heart failure medications because of symptomatic hypotension. Based on these risk factors, a discussion with the patient about his wishes for end-of-life care and thoughts about advanced heart failure therapies would be appropriate."
