Alternative regimens with similar coverage to amoxicillin-clavulanate include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a fluoroquinolone like ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, or doxycycline plus clindamycin or metronidazole. Monotherapy with moxifloxacin, which has anaerobic activity, can be considered as well. Although antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended (",

") after a human bite, this patient's immunocompromised state and the involvement of the hand increase the risk of infection and warrant antibiotic prophylaxis. In addition to immunocompromise and hand involvement, other factors that increase the risk of infection include wounds with associated edema or lymphatic or venous insufficiency; crush injury; wounds involving a joint or bone; deep puncture wounds; or wounds involving the face or genitalia. A 3- to 5-day course of antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. Surgical evaluation for possible debridement and removal of foreign bodies is particularly important with hand bites. Radiographs may demonstrate fracture, other bony involvement, or foreign bodies."
