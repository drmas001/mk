"). The patient's 5-month history of diarrhea, characterized as bowel movements containing oil droplets and necessitating multiple flushes, is consistent with steatorrhea. Causes of fat malabsorption include pancreatic dysfunction, infections (e.g., giardiasis and Whipple disease), celiac disease, tropical sprue, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO is caused by various conditions, including impaired motility, strictures (e.g., in Crohn disease), or blind loops (e.g., small-bowel diverticula). The patient's jejunal diverticulum is a blind loop and a key risk factor for SIBO. The pathogenesis of steatorrhea in SIBO is thought to be due to the deconjugation of bile salts by excessive intraluminal bacteria, interfering with formation of micelles that are necessary for fat absorption. SIBO can be diagnosed in the appropriate clinical context with both typical symptoms (abdominal discomfort, flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea) and a confirmatory test, such as a glucose breath test, in which exhaled hydrogen and methane (byproducts of bacterial metabolism of ingested glucose) are measured after glucose administration. Glucose breath tests are approximately 80% sensitive but only 40% specific for diagnosing SIBO. Empiric antibiotic therapy with monitoring for improvement in symptoms may be reasonable in patients with a high probability of SIBO."
