"). He has relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and recently received treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting the CD19 antigen on the leukemic cells. CAR-T cells can expand in the body, driven by the presence of cancer cells. The treatment is quite effective, and patients with high tumor burden, in whom the genetically engineered T cells effectively expand, may experience a severe inflammatory reaction triggered by the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, and by numerous activated lymphocytes and other immune cells. The clinical presentation of CRS can range from mild, with fever, malaise, and myalgia, to a severe inflammatory syndrome. Severe CRS requiring ICU admission is often characterized by vascular leak, hypotension, pulmonary edema, cardiac dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, liver failure, coagulopathy, multiorgan system failure, and even death. Treatment protocols include early supportive care with antipyretics for lower grades of CRS and high doses of glucocorticoids with cytokine-blocking monoclonal antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab) for higher grades of CRS. The patient should also be evaluated for infection-related sepsis."
