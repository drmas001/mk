"). Fluoroquinolones have been associated with QT-interval prolongation. Patients particularly at risk are those with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and concomitant use of other drugs that cause QT-interval prolongation (e.g., macrolides, azoles, amiodarone). Electrocardiography and corrected QT measurement should be performed before starting a fluoroquinolone in patients at increased risk and periodically thereafter for the duration of treatment. In the absence of additional risk factors, routine electrocardiography screening is not necessary. Additional adverse effects of fluoroquinolones include increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture (most commonly the Achilles tendon); hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia; peripheral neuropathy; and neurologic side effects such as delirium, agitation, nervousness, and memory impairment. Fluoroquinolones also carry a two-fold increased risk of rupture and dissection of the aorta; they should be avoided in persons who have an aortic aneurysm or are at risk for an aortic aneurysm (e.g., older adults and those with peripheral atherosclerotic vascular diseases, uncontrolled hypertension, certain genetic conditions) unless no other treatment options are available."
