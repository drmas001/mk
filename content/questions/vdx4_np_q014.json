"The most likely diagnosis is diabetic nephropathy as evidenced by Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules seen on this patient's biopsy. Diabetic nephropathy manifests initially as moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria). Over time, progressive proteinuria is followed by a decline in glomerular filtration rate, with progression to later stages of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. The diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is usually made clinically in the presence of hallmark features: proteinuric chronic kidney disease in a patient with long-standing diabetes and evidence of other complications (microvascular and/or macrovascular) of disease. If the clinical presentation is not entirely consistent with diabetic nephropathy, a kidney biopsy is performed. The biopsy finding of nodular mesangial sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules) with glomerular and tubular basement thickening, in the absence of immune deposits, is the classic description of diabetic nephropathy."
