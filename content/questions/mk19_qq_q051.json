" serotypes are the most common bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Infection usually results from ingesting fecally contaminated water or food of animal origin, including poultry, beef, eggs, and milk. Contact with infected animals (including pet reptiles, amphibians, and poultry) is a less common mode of transmission. The incubation period is usually less than 3 days, resulting in an inflammatory diarrhea, sometimes associated with fever and abdominal pain. In young healthy persons, such as this patient, the illness is usually self-limited and resolves without antibiotic therapy. In this population, antibiotic therapy is associated with prolonged asymptomatic fecal shedding with no decrease in duration of diarrhea. Antibiotics are typically reserved for patients with more serious illness (including severe diarrhea requiring hospitalization, bacteremia, high fever, or sepsis) and those at high risk for severe complicated invasive disease (including infants; patients aged ≥50 years; or those with prosthetic materials, significant atherosclerotic disease, or immunocompromising conditions)."
