Evidence shows that the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin are associated with a reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes, and dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are effective in patients without diabetes. In addition, for patients with type 2 diabetes, an SGLT2 inhibitor reduces progression of diabetic kidney disease. SGLT2 inhibitors should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes, increased risk for type 2 diabetic ketoacidosis, or rapidly declining or changing kidney function."

However, depending on the study, there was either a trend toward more heart failure hospitalizations (saxagliptin) or an increased incidence of heart failure (alogliptin). Because of this increased incidence of heart failure hospitalizations, adding saxagliptin as a second-line agent would not be appropriate."
