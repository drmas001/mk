"). Despite steady improvements in diagnostic and imaging techniques during the past decades, a reasonable evaluation will not identify the source of cancer in a small number (less than 5%) of all patients presenting with metastatic cancer. This heterogeneous group of patients is classified as having cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Standard evaluation of CUP includes a full medical history and physical examination and contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Histologic evaluation of the most accessible tumor mass should include a limited number of immunohistochemical stains to assess the nature of the tumor and to identify or exclude treatable histologies (such as lymphoma or germ cell tumor). Ultimately, CUP is a diagnosis of exclusion after evaluation has failed to identify the primary tumor, which may either be too small to be detected or may have been destroyed immunologically and is no longer present. The patient is a young male with a poorly differentiated CUP that is predominantly presenting in a midline distribution. In the absence of a clearly identified primary, these patients should be treated presumptively for metastatic testicular (germ cell) cancer with a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. The absence of serum α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin, normal testicular examination, or even normal ultrasonography does not exclude this treatment approach."
