His gait has slowed, and his behavior has changed. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications are lisinopril, carvedilol, atorvastatin, metformin, canagliflozin, and aspirin."

"). Vascular cognitive impairment is associated with systemic vascular risk factors and a history of stroke (either clinically diagnosed or based on neuroimaging evidence). Two major signs of vascular cognitive impairment are early gait impairment and personality or mood changes. The cognitive profile of vascular cognitive impairment most characteristically shows slowed processing speed out of proportion to deficits in other domains of cognition. The diagnosis of vascular dementia is based on the lack of hippocampal atrophy and presence of confluent white matter hyperintensities on MRI of the brain."

") is that of an insidious worsening of memory, language, and visuospatial abilities. Manifestations include forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, hesitation in speech, and visuospatial dysfunction (navigation problems). The inability to copy line drawings also suggests visuospatial dysfunction. MRI will show evidence of decreased volume of the hippocampi out of proportion to rest of the brain."

Many patients with behavioral-variant FTD have frontotemporal lobe atrophy."
