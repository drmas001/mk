The pain worsens when she turns her head to the right and with right lateral flexion, and it improves when she lies down. She also notes a sporadic tingling sensation on the lateral aspect of the right hand. She has not had any other symptoms. She reports recreational use of oral opioids."

There is no cervical spine tenderness. Pain is reproduced by applying downward pressure to the patient's head while it is bent to the right and extended (Spurling test). Pain is relieved by lifting her right arm above her head."

"). Radiculopathy is the result of any pathologic process that affects the nerve root. Cervical radiculopathy is suggested by the finding of, singly or in combination, pain in the neck, shoulder, or arms; upper extremity muscle weakness; reduced reflexes; or paresthesia. This patient probably has cervical radiculopathy, on the basis of the history and physical examination findings (neck pain with radiation to the arm, paresthesia in a dermatomal distribution, positive Spurling test, positive shoulder abduction test). Cervical radiculopathy may be managed conservatively as long as symptoms do not progress or become refractory. A multimodal approach that is tailored to the individual patient should be pursued and may include analgesic agents, range-of-motion exercise, and physical therapy. Symptoms generally improve in 6 to 8 weeks."
