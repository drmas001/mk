"). As a rule of thumb, there are normally about 8-15 platelets per 100-power field. The peripheral blood smear contains many more than this number of platelets, suggesting a very high platelet count and the possible diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. Other clues to the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia are the presence of large platelets (",

") and platelet fragments. Most patients with essential thrombocythemia are asymptomatic and present with an elevated platelet count found on routine laboratory testing. Patients may present with vasomotor symptoms, such as headache, visual disturbances, dysesthesia of the palms and soles, syncope, and livedo reticularis. Other complications of essential thrombocythemia include thrombosis and hemorrhage."
