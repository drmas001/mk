"A 29-year-old woman is evaluated for mood swings that occur with every menstrual cycle. Symptoms typically begin 4 to 5 days before the onset of menses and include feeling tense, unusually anxious, and unhappy. She also experiences increased irritability, angry outbursts, breast pain and bloating, and insomnia. She describes her mood in between menses as “generally good.” Medical history is significant for migraine with aura, for which she takes sumatriptan as needed. An intrauterine device was placed 3 years ago."

"), is appropriate. Diagnosis of PMDD requires the presence of at least one primary symptom: mood swings, irritability or anger, feelings of hopelessness or depressed mood, and anxiety. In addition, a patient must have a total of at least five symptoms, which may also include appetite changes; decreased interest in usual activities; fatigue; difficulty concentrating; feelings of loss of control; sleep disturbance; and physical symptoms (breast tenderness, weight gain, bloating, myalgia). Symptoms occur the week before menses and remit within 1 week after and are present during most menstrual cycles. First-line therapy for PMDD includes the same second-generation antidepressants used for major depressive disorder, with special emphasis on safety in pregnancy, because women experiencing PMDD are typically of reproductive age. Most SSRIs are FDA pregnancy category C (except paroxetine, which is category D)."
