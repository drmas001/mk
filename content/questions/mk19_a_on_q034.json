"A 64-year-old woman is evaluated in the office following a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. Six years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with lumpectomy, irradiation, and a complete course of adjuvant hormonal therapy. Two weeks ago, a bone lytic lesion was found on a lumbar spine radiograph taken for low back pain after a fall while playing tennis. Subsequent CT scans revealed diffuse involvement of her axial skeleton with no associated fractures and no epidural extension. The patient is currently asymptomatic. Medical history is unremarkable, and she takes no medications."

"). A bone-modifying agent is administered routinely to all patients with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases to prevent the development of skeletal-related events, including bone pain, cord compression, need for palliative radiation therapy, and hypercalcemia. Appropriate agents include zoledronic acid (a bisphosphonate) or denosumab (a receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand inhibitor). Zoledronic acid and denosumab are generally administered every 3 months because of similar efficacy to monthly dosing. Zoledronic acid is cleared through the kidneys and is contraindicated among patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. Dose adjustment is not recommended for denosumab in patients with renal insufficiency. Both agents may cause symptomatic hypocalcemia. Additionally, both agents are associated with small risks of osteonecrosis of the jaw, and treatment should generally be held for patients who have active dental issues for which extractions or other dental work is needed. Zoledronic acid is substantially less costly than denosumab and, given similar efficacy, should be the preferred option for most patients."
