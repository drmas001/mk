"). Obesity lowers sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and leads to a falsely low total testosterone level (which measures free plus protein-bound testosterone); the free testosterone concentration remains normal. Measurement of free testosterone in a laboratory capable of performing the equilibrium dialysis assay is recommended to distinguish between a suspected binding abnormality and hypogonadism in a man with obesity. The binding abnormality caused by obesity is proportional to the degree of obesity. If free testosterone is low, a serum luteinizing hormone (LH) measurement is indicated. An elevated LH level and low free testosterone reflects primary hypogonadism (testicular failure), and further evaluation should be directed toward identifying the cause. A low or normal LH level with simultaneous low free testosterone reflects secondary hypogonadism (hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction). Several other causes of abnormal SHBG levels should also be considered in evaluation for hypogonadism. Increased SHBG levels may be associated with aging, hyperthyroidism, high estrogen concentrations, liver disease, HIV infection, and antiseizure drugs. In addition to obesity, reduced SHBG levels may be associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, growth hormone excess, exogenous androgens or anabolic steroids, glucocorticoids, progestins, and nephrotic syndrome."

Examples of nonspecific symptoms include decreased mood, energy, concentration, muscle strength and bulk, and stamina, as well as poor sleep and memory.
