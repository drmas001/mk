"). Any single positive stool test for colorectal cancer should prompt diagnostic colonoscopy. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) has improved accuracy compared with guaiac fecal occult blood test, but the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has reported that sensitivity remains only about 73% to 88%, with specificity ranges from 91% to 96%. The lower sensitivity is the main indication for performing stool-based FIT screening at least every other year. This woman with average risk for colorectal cancer and a positive FIT screening result should be advised to have diagnostic colonoscopy."

") as a second-tier test for colorectal cancer screening every 5 years in average-risk patients. CT colonography provides a computer-simulated endoluminal perspective of the air-inflated colon. As for colonoscopy, bowel preparation is required. Colonoscopy is more accurate in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer compared with colonography and has the added ability to biopsy suspicious lesions; CT colonography is only an imaging test, and biopsy cannot be performed."
