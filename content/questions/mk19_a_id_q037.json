"The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends that clinicians start antiviral treatment in outpatients of any age with severe or progressive illness, regardless of illness duration; outpatients who are at high risk of complications from influenza, including those with chronic medical conditions and immunocompromise; and pregnant women and those within 2 weeks postpartum. Antiviral treatment can be considered for adult outpatients not at high risk for complications and illness onset no more than 2 days before presentation. Other considerations for treatment include symptomatic outpatients who are household contacts of persons who are at high risk, particularly those who are severely immunocompromised, and symptomatic health care providers who care for patients who are at high risk, particularly those who are severely immunocompromised. The patient is an otherwise healthy outpatient and will not benefit from treatment with either baloxavir or oseltamivir (",

") is preferred to rapid antigen testing. The IDSA recommends that clinicians test for influenza in patients at high risk, including immunocompromised persons who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness, if the testing result will influence clinical management. Influenza testing can be considered for patients not at high risk if the results might influence antiviral treatment decisions, reduce use of unnecessary antibiotics, further diagnostic testing, or if the results might influence antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions for high-risk household contacts. Because the patient lives alone, does not work in the health care environment, and antiviral agents will not be initiated, the patient has no indications for testing."
