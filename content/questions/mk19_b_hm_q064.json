"). For patients with uncomplicated deep venous thrombosis (DVT), the American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline suggests offering home treatment over hospital treatment. For patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), ASH suggests using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban, over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin. However, this recommendation may not apply to certain subgroups of patients, such as those with kidney disease (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, except for apixaban), moderate to severe liver disease, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In some of these patients, warfarin will be preferred. Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor. It is approved for treatment of VTE as monotherapy, without the need for initial parenteral anticoagulation. For an acute VTE, initial dosing is 10 mg twice daily for 1 week and then 5 mg twice daily thereafter. Rivaroxaban, another factor Xa inhibitor, can also be initiated without initial parenteral therapy. Both apixaban and rivaroxaban allow for discharge directly to home with oral therapy. In some instances, the cost of DOACs and the lack of insurance coverage may lead patients who do not otherwise require hospitalization to choose low-molecular-weight heparin for the acute home-based management of VTE."

"). However, initial therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin for at least 5 days is required with both of these agents. Therefore, because initial parenteral treatment is necessary when using dabigatran or edoxaban, these would not be the best choices for this patient."
