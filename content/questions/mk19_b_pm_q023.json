"). The most likely diagnosis in this patient is malignant mesothelioma, an aggressive tumor arising from mesothelial cells. Malignant mesothelioma is associated with occupational asbestos exposure in up to 70% of cases. Patients can have a long latent period, extending into decades, before manifesting the disease. Therefore, it is essential to obtain a thorough employment history, including the use of respiratory protective equipment at the workplace. Patients usually present with chest pain, dyspnea, cough, and restrictive gas exchange abnormality. The radiographic manifestation is usually a unilateral pleural effusion or pleural thickening. CT is the primary modality for the diagnosis and staging of malignant mesothelioma. Prognosis is poor, with most patients dying of local extension of the disease and respiratory failure within 12 to 18 months of diagnosis."

") may result in coal worker's pneumoconiosis. Coal dust may contain high concentrations of silica and silicates, which can result in a rapidly progressive lung disease with imaging characteristics that include honeycombing and ground-glass opacification. Inhalation of coal dust without substantial amounts of silica can result in nodular opacities and eventually massive pulmonary fibrosis. These findings are currently less common because of improved mine safety standards. Pleural effusions are not commonly seen."
