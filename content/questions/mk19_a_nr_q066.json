"). The patient had an embolic stroke, given the location in the occipital lobe and normal findings on vascular imaging. Leading causes of stroke in young patients with no risk factors include cervicocephalic artery dissection, a hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and embolism from a patent foramen ovale. This patient does not have a headache, and the magnetic resonance angiogram was normal, making a dissection very unlikely. Her lack of other systemic symptoms, including fevers, rash, and joint pain, makes vasculitis less likely. A primary hypercoagulable state remains possible and should be investigated, although it is less likely given her normal laboratory values and prior pregnancies without complications. TTE with agitated saline injection can reveal a right-to-left shunt, is less invasive than other cardiac imaging, and is indicated in younger patients with stroke without other risk factors. Agitated saline with a TTE is not indicated in patients older than 45 to 50 years because a patent foramen ovale is less likely to be causally related to symptoms in that age group."
