"). Given the benign nature of vasovagal syncope and its frequent remissions, medical treatment is usually not required unless conservative measures are unsatisfactory. According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society syncope guideline, all patients with vasovagal syncope should be provided an explanation of the diagnosis, education targeting awareness of and possible avoidance of triggers (e.g., prolonged standing, warm environments), and reassurance about the benign nature of the condition. The guideline suggests that physical counterpressure maneuvers can be useful in patients with vasovagal syncope who have a sufficiently long prodromal period. These measures, including leg crossing, limb and/or abdominal contraction, and squatting, are considered a core management strategy."

") is reasonable in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope despite first-line therapy and no history of hypertension, heart failure, or urinary retention. Midodrine is a prodrug that is metabolized to a peripherally active α-agonist. It is used to ameliorate the reduction in peripheral sympathetic neural outflow responsible for venous pooling and vasodepression in vasovagal syncope. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found midodrine reduced recurrent vasovagal syncope by 43%. Midodrine might be reasonable in patients with symptoms unresponsive to first-line therapy."

The bradycardia and syncope should be documented by electrocardiographic monitoring, and first-line therapy, including volume support, physical counterpressure maneuvers, and medications, must have failed. This patient does not have an indication for pacemaker placement."
