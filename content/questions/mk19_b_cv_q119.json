"). This patient presents with chest pain that is concerning for ischemic heart disease, and cardiac stress testing is indicated. Stress testing to evaluate for coronary artery disease should always be performed with exercise, unless exercise is contraindicated or the patient is unable. Exercise capacity is a powerful predictor of outcomes; individuals unable to achieve 5 metabolic equivalents, or the first stage of a Bruce protocol, have higher all-cause mortality. In addition to its role as a first-line test for possible coronary artery disease, stress testing with imaging is indicated in patients with an inability to exercise, baseline ECG abnormalities that limit interpretation of the exercise ECG, or indeterminate findings on the exercise ECG. Exercise myocardial perfusion imaging provides a visual assessment of relative myocardial blood flow (using a radionuclide tracer) by comparing images in the resting and stressed states. This test is the most appropriate option for this patient with left ventricular hypertrophy with a strain pattern on baseline ECG that will impair the interpretation of an exercise ECG."

Contraindications include an inability to exercise and baseline ECG abnormalities (e.g., ST-segment depression >1 mm, left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, or preexcitation). This patient's chest pain in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy will be better assessed with exercise myocardial perfusion imaging because the ECG changes associated with left ventricular hypertrophy will obscure the presence of ECG ischemic changes."
