The risk for recurrent stroke is approximately 26% over the next 2 years. Carotid endarterectomy is highly effective in reducing the risk for recurrent stroke in the immediate poststroke period.

") would be inappropriate for this patient. Clinical trials have shown that for the outcomes of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, stenting and endarterectomy are not significantly different. However, stenting poses a greater risk for perioperative stroke than does endarterectomy. Therefore, it is not recommended as a primary intervention for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. In patients who are considered high risk for carotid endarterectomy, such as those with major cardiac comorbid conditions, stenting is an alternative."
