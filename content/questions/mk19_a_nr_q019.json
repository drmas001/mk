" For any patient with a first seizure, obtaining a detailed history is crucial to distinguish seizures from other causes of symptoms. Making the distinction between seizure and nonseizure events and first-time versus recurrent episodes is key in selecting the proper management. The patient likely had a first (new-onset) seizure, and neuroimaging is indicated for all adult patients with a first-time seizure. CT of the head is adequate initially to rapidly exclude emergent pathology, including hemorrhage, but MRI is required and preferred in most patients. Because temporal lobe epilepsy is common, MRI sequences focusing on the hippocampus and temporal lobes are useful. Outpatient electroencephalography (EEG) also is recommended in patients with a first seizure (and has already been scheduled in this case). A single routine EEG is only 40% to 50% sensitive in the diagnosis of seizure, but the yield can increase to 80% to 90% with repeated studies, prolonged studies, and studies that capture sleep."
