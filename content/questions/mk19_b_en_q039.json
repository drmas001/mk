"). Primary hypogonadism is characterized by low testosterone with elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, indicating failure of the testes to produce testosterone. Klinefelter syndrome is the most common cause of primary hypogonadism and occurs in approximately 1 in 600 live births. Klinefelter syndrome is variable in phenotype and severity; the most severe forms are recognized before puberty, and manifestations include micropenis, clinodactyly, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. Prepubertal boys may present with behavioral abnormalities, language delay, and learning disabilities. Boys can also be diagnosed by delayed puberty, including testes growth failure, incomplete virilization, and gynecomastia. Diagnosis is often missed, however, and most diagnoses are in adulthood, with a mean age of 30 years. Adult men with Klinefelter syndrome typically present with tall stature; small, firm testes (≤4 mL); infertility (due to azoospermia); and signs of androgen deficiency, including gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, decreased muscle mass, and decreased sexual hair. The diagnosis is confirmed with karyotype analysis revealing a 47,XXY karyotype. Treatment is testosterone replacement; however, this therapy does not improve fertility. Consultation with a reproductive specialist is needed for patients who desire fertility."
