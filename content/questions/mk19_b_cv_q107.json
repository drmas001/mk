"). This patient is currently treated with triple therapy with an oral anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) and recurrent acute coronary syndrome, respectively. Each of these drugs is the cornerstone of preventive therapy for the respective disease processes; however, together they significantly increase the risk for bleeding. This patient is being evaluated 7 months after coronary stent placement, and she has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is reasonable to discontinue aspirin to reduce the risk for bleeding associated with triple therapy, as several trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of double therapy with an oral anticoagulant and a second- or third-generation P2Y",

"-VASc score is 4 (1 point each for age 65-74 years, female sex, hypertension, and coronary artery disease), putting her at substantial risk for AF-related stroke. Although dual antiplatelet therapy may be sufficient to prevent recurrent acute coronary syndrome, it is insufficient therapy to prevent stroke. Therefore, discontinuation of rivaroxaban (",

") may reduce this patient's risk for bleeding, this strategy has two drawbacks. First, triple therapy with reduced-dose apixaban may not be associated with a lower bleeding risk than dual therapy with rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel. Second, the reduced dose of apixaban for stroke prevention in AF is indicated among patients with at least two of the following three criteria: age 80 years or older, weight less than 60 kg (132.3 lb), and serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL or higher (≥132.6 μmol/L). She does not fulfill these criteria and will not be adequately treated to prevent AF-related stroke with reduced-dose apixaban."
