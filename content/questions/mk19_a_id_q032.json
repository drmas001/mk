"). Femoral venous catheters are associated with higher rates of infection and should be avoided, if possible. Aseptic technique and following the CVC insertion bundle decrease the risk of central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), but these strategies are not assured when a CVC is placed emergently. The CVC insertion bundle includes hand hygiene; use of full barrier precautions (large full-body sterile drape to cover the patient during catheter insertion) and personal protective equipment (mask, cap, sterile gown, and gloves); chlorhexidine skin antisepsis (allow antiseptic to air dry before beginning procedure); optimal site selection and catheter type (e.g., minimum number of ports or lumens needed); sterile dressing; and daily review of necessity, with prompt removal of unnecessary catheters. The daily review of line necessity and documentation can be achieved with multidisciplinary rounds, daily reminders, and automated alerts. These practices are important in decreasing the risk of developing CLABSIs. Additionally, hand hygiene before manipulation of the intravenous system, care of injection ports, and proper catheter site dressing monitoring and dressing changes reduce risk of infection. Not following these measures increases the risk for development of a CLABSI."
