") to screen for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The diagnosis of CTEPH is difficult and can be overlooked as a cause of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In patients diagnosed with PH, evaluation for CTEPH is warranted even when a history of acute pulmonary embolism is absent. The incidence of CTEPH following acute pulmonary embolism is likely less than 5%. More than 20% of patients with CTEPH do not have a previous diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the diagnosis of CTEPH should not automatically be excluded in patients without a history of pulmonary embolism. In patients who develop or continue to have symptoms suggesting PH after 3 months of appropriate anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism, screening for CTEPH is warranted. A normal V/Q scan is sufficient to exclude CTEPH as its sensitivity for detecting chronic thrombus approaches 100%. An abnormal V/Q requires additional investigation, typically with right heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography."
