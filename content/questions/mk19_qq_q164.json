"), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at IgE. This patient has severe asthma, which is asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence to maximal optimized therapy and treatment of contributory factors, that worsens when high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid treatment is decreased, or that requires continuous oral glucocorticoids. Severe asthma is characterized by frequent exacerbations; patients may require emergency department visits or hospitalizations and may experience long durations of treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids. This patient's asthma has not been controlled despite trigger avoidance and treatment with multiple controller drugs. Omalizumab is indicated in patients with severe persistent asthma inadequately controlled with standard therapy who have elevated IgE levels and sensitivity to multiple allergens, as documented by skin testing, or elevated serum allergen-specific IgE. Omalizumab is administered subcutaneously every 2 to 4 weeks."

In this patient with sensitivity to multiple allergens, omalizumab anti-IgE therapy is a more appropriate choice. Beneficial effects of allergen immunotherapy begin during the first year of therapy, whereas omalizumab would be expected to provide asthma control within weeks."
