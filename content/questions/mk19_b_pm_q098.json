") leading to pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH occurs when a patient's pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. Normal mean pulmonary artery pressure in adults is rarely greater than 20 mm Hg. Accordingly, the Sixth World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) has defined PH as mean pulmonary pressure greater than 20 mm Hg. The WSPH has further classified PH into five groups based on the clinical, epidemiologic, and histologic profiles. PH related to left-sided heart disease (group 2) accounts for 65% to 80% of all PH diagnoses. This patient has several risk factors that support underlying left-sided heart disease, including advanced age, history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.
