"), the second most common skin cancer, is a malignant neoplasm of keratinocytes. It usually presents as pink, scaly, indurated plaques, papules, or nodules that can ulcerate, bleed, or become crusty. SCCs tend to retain their surface scale, and as an SCC accumulates a large amount of scale, it is called a cutaneous horn. Risk factors are exposure to UV light, ionizing radiation, or chemical carcinogens (coal tar, soot, and arsenic); viruses (human papillomavirus); and immunosuppression (organ transplant, hematologic malignancies, HIV infection). SCC on the central face, lips, or ear, as seen in this patient, is considered high risk and should be treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. Mohs micrographic surgery is a highly specialized surgical technique that combines pathology and surgery for complete margin control and tissue conservation. It is appropriately used for cancers in the head and neck region, those that are large or recurrent, or those in areas where tissue-sparing is critical for function."

") is the most common skin cancer. It commonly presents as a pink, pearly papule with rolled borders and arborizing telangiectasias. Patients commonly report bleeding of BCCs with any manipulation, such as shaving or washing the face. BCC does not present as hyperkeratotic lesions, as seen in this patient. Similar to SCC, BCC is usually treated with surgical excision. Mohs micrographic surgery is appropriate for BCC in the head and neck region."

Bowen disease appears as larger scaly pink and tan plaques with well-defined borders and does not resemble this patient's hyperkeratotic nodule. Small lesions can be excised for cure; larger lesions may be more amenable to destructive therapies, such as curettage and electrodesiccation or cryotherapy."

") are benign pigmented neoplasms of keratinocyte origin that are common in adults. They are “stuck-on” papules and plaques that occur anywhere on the body but are most common on the trunk and spare the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. Usually they are brown, but they can range in color from tan to black. When seborrheic keratoses are symptomatic, they may be treated with cryotherapy or shave removal. This patient's hyperkeratotic nodule on the ear is most consistent with SCC."
