") for this patient with herpes zoster infection. Initiation of systemic antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) can help attenuate the duration of rash and symptoms during a herpes zoster outbreak and reduce the risk for postherpetic neuralgia if administered within the first 72 hours after onset of symptoms. Valacyclovir and famciclovir are often preferred because of possible increased efficacy and decreased frequency of dosing compared with acyclovir. This effect is best established in patients older than 50 years. Varicella-zoster virus is a DNA virus that causes varicella (chickenpox), which is an acute illness with fever and an eruption of vesicles on an erythematous base that is transmitted by respiratory droplets. After primary infection, the virus remains latent in the dorsal root or cranial ganglia. Reactivation causes herpes zoster. Prodromal symptoms, such as burning, stinging, or tingling, often occur in a localized region, followed by a dermatomal eruption of grouped vesicles or pustules on an erythematous base. The most common dermatomes affected are in the thoracic region. With involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve (forehead extending over upper eyelid, or nasal tip involvement), ophthalmologic evaluation is mandatory because herpes zoster ophthalmicus and possible blindness can result. If vesicles are noted in the external ear canal, evaluation by an otolaryngologist may be required because peripheral facial paralysis and auditory/vestibular symptoms can occur (Ramsay Hunt syndrome)."

"), to antiviral therapy to reduce the symptoms of herpes zoster or the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia is defined as chronic neuropathic pain that persists for 3 months or more after the initial onset of herpes zoster. Glucocorticoids may be considered as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe acute neuritis, but this is not necessary in this patient with mild to moderate pain."
