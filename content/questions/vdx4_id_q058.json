"This chest CT scan suggests an invasive fungal infection, such as aspergillosis. The CT scan shows a nodular opacity with poorly defined borders and surrounding ground-glass opacification. This appearance, referred to as a “halo sign,” is an early radiographic finding in patients with aspergillosis. The ground-glass appearance surrounding the fungal nodule indicates hemorrhage into the surrounding lung tissue. In the appropriate clinical setting, such as neutropenia, the halo sign may indicate aspergillosis or other angioinvasive fungal infection, including fusariosis and zygomycosis. A malignant nodule would be more likely to be spiculated and not have the halo appearance."
