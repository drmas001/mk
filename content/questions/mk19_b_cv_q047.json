"). SCAD is the most common cause of pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction and commonly occurs during pregnancy or in the first month postpartum. SCAD involves development of a nontraumatic and non-iatrogenic intramural hematoma with or without intimal dissection with luminal communication. The enlarging hematoma in the false lumen compresses the true lumen of the coronary artery and in potential combination with obstructing dissection leads to chest pain, ischemia, and/or infarction. The diagnosis requires coronary CT or coronary angiography to confirm the characteristic imaging features. When associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, SCAD may be managed invasively; however, percutaneous coronary intervention may be safely deferred when coronary flow is preserved and symptoms can be controlled and closely monitored."

") within a coronary artery. The rupture causes platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation, resulting in a thrombosed coronary artery and acute vessel occlusion. The sudden loss of coronary blood flow leads to transmural ischemia of the myocardium and the ECG manifestation of ST-segment elevation. Acute coronary thrombosis is a less likely cause of myocardial infarction than coronary artery dissection in this postpartum young woman with no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors."

Patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy present with features that mimic an acute coronary syndrome. This patient's clinical picture is inconsistent with stress-induced cardiomyopathy given the regional wall hypokinesis, which is more typical of coronary artery ischemia."
