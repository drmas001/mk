") is the most appropriate management for this patient, who most likely has a toxic nodule or nodules causing his hyperthyroidism. The initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule begins with measuring thyroid stimulating-hormone (TSH). TSH suppression is found with autonomously functioning or “hot” nodules, accounting for 5% to 10% of palpable thyroid nodules. Patients with thyroid nodules and a suppressed TSH are evaluated with thyroid scintigraphy. A radioactive isotope is administered, the percentage taken up by the thyroid is calculated (radioactive iodine uptake), and an image is obtained (thyroid scan). Hot nodules concentrate radioactive iodine to a greater extent than normal thyroid tissue. Autonomous hot nodules have a very low risk for malignancy and do not require fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Because multiple nodules were identified on neck ultrasonography, it is important to ascertain which of them are autonomous. Performing a radioactive iodine uptake and scan will help identify whether one or more of the nodules are responsible for the patient's thyroid function abnormalities."

") is indicated elsewhere in the gland. Nodules identified as autonomously functioning (or hot) do not require fine-needle aspiration, whereas nodules that are either “cold” or “warm” (with uptake similar to that of the surrounding nonnodular thyroid tissue) may require cytologic evaluation. Performing an FNAB on the largest nodule may not be necessary if the nodule is autonomously functioning, and not performing an FNAB on the small nodule may miss a nonfunctioning nodule that might harbor thyroid cancer."

"); however, his hyperthyroidism is mild, and it is safe to wait to initiate medical therapy until after the thyroid scan is performed. In patients with a greater degree of thyrotoxicosis, beginning methimazole to lower the thyroid hormone levels before performing additional testing is reasonable. Once the hormone levels are nearing the normal range, methimazole should be withheld for 5 days before a thyroid scan."
