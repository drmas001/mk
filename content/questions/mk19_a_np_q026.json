"). This patient, who is at increased risk for multiple types of skin cancer, should be referred to a dermatologist or a clinician with special expertise for annual screening; screening frequency is increased for patients who have a history of skin cancer. Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk for various complications due to their original underlying end-stage kidney disease and the use of chronic immunosuppressive medications, which may be related to risks for altered immune surveillance or idiosyncratic medication side effects. Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk for several other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, anogenital cancers, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. These patients are also at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and those treated with glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors are at increased risk for new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT)."
