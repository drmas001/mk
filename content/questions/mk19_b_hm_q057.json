"). Sickle cell disease (SCD) carries an increased risk of perioperative complications with surgeries other than low-risk procedures (e.g., skin biopsy). This increased risk is particularly true in those with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin Sβ° disease. Evidence-based care for patients with hemoglobin SS disease undergoing surgeries other than low-risk procedures is to provide simple erythrocyte transfusion. This recommendation is based on results from a clinical trial in which patients were randomized either to no transfusion or to simple transfusion to achieve a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (100 g/L) preoperatively. A significant increase in serious adverse events was seen in those who did not receive transfusion. Patients who received transfusion also had a lower incidence of developing acute chest syndrome. No data are available on outcomes using postoperative transfusion (",

"Hydroxyurea reduces vaso-occlusive events in SCD, with some data demonstrating improved survival with long-term use. Its efficacy appears to be partially related to increasing hemoglobin F production and decreasing the relative concentration of hemoglobin S. It should be considered for use in adults who have significant clinical manifestations, including three or more painful vaso-occlusive events per year. However, hydroxyurea use has not been studied specifically for the perioperative setting (",
