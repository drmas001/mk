"). Lyme disease accounts for up to 25% of cases of facial nerve palsy in endemic areas during summer months. Facial nerve palsy caused by neuroborreliosis can be unilateral or bilateral and may present alone or overlap with meningitis. Without previously documented or concurrent erythema migrans, laboratory testing is necessary to distinguish facial palsy resulting from Lyme disease from Bell palsy (idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy). Laboratory confirmation of Lyme disease employs a two-tiered serologic algorithm. In patients with a positive or equivocal screening enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or indirect fluorescent antibody test, a secondary confirmatory EIA (previously, Western blot was most common) is performed. A positive IgM antibody with a negative IgG antibody can occur early in the course of infection when insufficient time has passed for IgG seroconversion, as is the case in this patient. The IgG almost invariably becomes positive within 4 weeks of symptom onset; after this time period, a negative IgG Western blot excludes a diagnosis of Lyme disease. A sequential EIA test that reacts with a different bacterial epitope has been approved as an alternative confirmatory test and may eventually replace the Western blot as the preferred assay."
