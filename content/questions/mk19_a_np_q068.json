"). This patient with hypertension requires escalation of her antihypertensive medication regimen because her blood pressure (BP) is not at target. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association BP guideline recommends a BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. Two strategies can be used: maximize medication dose before adding another agent or add another agent from a different class of medication before maximizing the dose of the prior agents. There are no randomized trials comparing these strategies. Generally, there is diminishing return in BP lowering if dose is titrated up from 50% to 100% of maximum. Also, it is unlikely that increasing the dose of a drug from 50% to 100% of maximum will result in a significant BP reduction. Finally, titration to maximum doses more commonly results in side effects and may reduce medication adherence. Therefore, adding a third drug to a two-drug regimen is a strategy recommended by many experts."

"Two drugs from classes that target the same BP control system are less effective and potentially harmful when used together. For example, administration of combination therapy with renin-angiotensin system blockers, such as an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or an ACE inhibitor or ARB with the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren, increases cardiovascular and renal risk. Therefore, aliskiren should not be added (",
