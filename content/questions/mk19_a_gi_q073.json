"). Surveillance endoscopy is based on the concern that some gastric cancers present as gastric ulcers that initially appear endoscopically and histologically benign. However, this rationale is of limited clinical use and is not cost-effective. As such, no U.S. or Canadian gastroenterology society has recommended routine surveillance for gastric ulcers. Instead, the decision to perform surveillance endoscopy for a gastric ulcer should be individualized. Surveillance with endoscopy is not necessary in patients with a low risk for gastric cancer, such as this patient, who was taking an NSAID and had endoscopic findings suggesting a typical NSAID-associated gastric ulcer, unremarkable biopsy specimens from the ulcer, and symptom resolution with appropriate medical therapy."

"Surveillance endoscopy may be considered in gastric ulcers that appear suspicious for malignancy, ulcers that were not biopsied at the time of index endoscopy, or ulcers with an unclear cause. Features of the ulcer that raise suspicion for malignancy include a dirty ulcer base, a raised ulcer border, and/or irregular ulcer margins. Ulcers larger than 3 cm should also be followed endoscopically given their increased risk for complications, including rebleeding, penetration, and/or perforation. Surveillance endoscopy may be considered in patients who remain symptomatic despite an appropriate course (8-12 weeks) of antisecretory therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (",
