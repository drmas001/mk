"When urticarial vasculitis is accompanied by decreased serum complement (C3 or C4), it is classified as hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis; these cases are strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and glomerulonephritis. The cause of urticaria is investigated primarily by history and physical examination. Diagnostic evaluation for urticaria is not recommended unless history suggests a specific cause. If symptoms persist, laboratory tests, including a complete blood count with differential, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and liver chemistry tests, can be considered. If associated with systemic symptoms or suspicion of urticarial vasculitis, skin biopsy is helpful."

"Typical urticaria lesions itch and are transient, and wheals appear and disappear within minutes to a few hours.
