"). This patient presents with acute unilateral conjunctival redness accompanied by mucopurulent discharge, which is consistent with acute bacterial conjunctivitis. According to the 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology guideline, mild bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, and it typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults. Use of topical antibacterial therapy is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission compared with placebo in days 2 to 5 of treatment. Treatment may reduce transmissibility. The choice of antibiotic is usually empiric. Because a course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected; there is no clinical evidence suggesting the superiority of any particular antibiotic. Although there are no data supporting the cost-effectiveness of using antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis, the shortened morbidity associated with their use makes choice of therapy an individual decision. Trimethoprim-polymyxin ophthalmic solution is an appropriate antibiotic option for patients, such as this one, who do not wear contact lenses. Other reasonable options are erythromycin or bacitracin-polymyxin ophthalmic ointments. Lack of symptom improvement or symptom worsening within several days of initiation of an appropriate topical antimicrobial should prompt ophthalmology referral."
