"). This patient has developed thyrotoxicosis while taking amiodarone. Amiodarone has a high iodine content (37%) and prolonged half-life of approximately 60 days or longer. Thyrotoxicosis affects 5% of patients treated with amiodarone. Type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) (hyperthyroidism) occurs in patients with Graves disease or thyroid nodules. This form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon) is typically treated with methimazole. Type 2 AIT (destructive thyroiditis) is more common and occurs in patients without underlying thyroid disease. Type 2 AIT is usually self-limiting but sometimes requires treatment with glucocorticoids. Thyroid ultrasonography with Doppler studies, in addition to identifying thyroid nodules, allows assessment of the gland vascularity. Increased vascularity suggests type 1 AIT as the cause, whereas decreased vascularity suggests type 2 AIT. The decision to discontinue amiodarone depends on the patient's cardiac condition and type of thyrotoxicosis and should be done in consultation with a cardiologist."

") is useful in distinguishing endogenous thyrotoxicosis from exogenous thyrotoxicosis, with the former leading to increased or normal levels and the latter leading to low levels. This test would be useful for patients who may be surreptitiously taking thyroid hormone. This patient has no history to suggest exogenous intake of thyroid hormone. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins or thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies may be useful in identifying Graves disease as a potential cause of the thyrotoxicosis."
