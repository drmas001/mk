"). Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with antiplatelet and vasodilator activity, increases pain-free walking distance and overall walking distance in patients with claudication. This patient with established peripheral artery disease (PAD) is receiving guideline-directed medical therapy and has completed a supervised exercise program, but he has persistent symptoms. The most appropriate treatment is to add cilostazol to his medication regimen. As with other oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., milrinone), the FDA has placed a black box warning on use of cilostazol in patients with heart failure. Side effects of cilostazol include headache, diarrhea, dizziness, and palpitations. Up to 20% of patients discontinue cilostazol within 3 months due to side effects."
