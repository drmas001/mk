"). The goals of sepsis management are to treat infection and optimize tissue perfusion. This is accomplished by starting early and appropriate antibiotic therapy and using 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer solution (preferred) to maintain an adequate preload. An initial bolus of 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid should be given in the first 3 hours of presentation when hypotension is present. When lactate levels are elevated more than 2 mEq/L (2 mmol/L), they should be rechecked within 2 to 4 hours to ensure improvement. If a fluid challenge does not achieve an adequate blood pressure (defined as a mean arterial pressure â‰¥65 mm Hg), initiation of a vasoactive agent is indicated to ensure that tissue perfusion is maintained."
