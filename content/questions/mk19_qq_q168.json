"), including exercise, reduced caloric intake, and behavioral modifications. With a BMI of 36, this patient meets the criterion for obesity (BMI â‰¥30). Furthermore, her waist circumference is greater than 40 inches, which is independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk. American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/The Obesity Society guidelines recommend lifestyle modification that include reduced caloric intake, increased physical activity, and behavioral therapy in all patients with obesity. Similarly, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends offering or referring patients with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. In addition to increasing physical activity (150-300 min/wk of moderate exercise) and behavioral therapy (aimed at avoiding fast food and inappropriate snacking), this patient should be prescribed a diet that maintains a deficit of 500 kcal/d. Maintaining a continuous negative energy balance of 500 kcal/d results in a weight loss of about 1.1 lb per week. Involving dieticians, exercise therapists, and behavioral therapists increases the chances of success."

Liraglutide can be used in patients with or without diabetes but may be best suited for a patient with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk. This patient should pursue lifestyle modifications before considering pharmacologic therapy for obesity."
