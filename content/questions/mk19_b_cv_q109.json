"), or earlier as dictated by a change in clinical status or examination findings concerning for heart failure. This patient's examination findings (widened pulse pressure, murmur, and bounding pulses) are consistent with severe aortic regurgitation (AR). With all regurgitant lesions, indications for invasive intervention are based on either the negative impact of valvular regurgitation on ventricular size/contractility or the emergence of symptoms due to valvular regurgitation or heart failure. In symptomatic patients with severe AR, aortic valve surgery is indicated regardless of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. In asymptomatic patients with chronic severe AR and LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction ≤55%), aortic valve surgery is indicated if no other cause for systolic dysfunction is identified. In asymptomatic patients with severe AR and normal LV systolic function (LV ejection fraction >55%), aortic valve surgery is reasonable if the left ventricle is severely enlarged (LV end-systolic dimension >50 mm)."
