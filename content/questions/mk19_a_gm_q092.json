") due to metastatic prostate cancer. Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine, along with immediate neurosurgical evaluation, is indicated. Cauda equina syndrome classically presents with acute low back pain radiating to the legs. The dominant finding is bilateral leg weakness that may be associated with saddle anesthesia, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction. On physical examination, decreased or absent distal reflexes and decreased anal sphincter tone may be noted along with bilateral leg weakness. Cauda equina syndrome is most commonly caused by disk herniation, degenerative changes, or spondylosis, but it can also result from trauma, infection, or cancer (most commonly prostate cancer, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma). MRI of the lumbosacral spine can visualize neurologic compromise of the cauda equina."

") can rarely occur after radiation to the pelvis and other bones during treatment for prostate cancer. Insufficiency fractures are a subtype of stress fracture that develops after normal stress to weakened bone. These fractures occur in approximately 5% of patients who receive whole-pelvis radiation therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer. Most patients are also usually receiving androgen deprivation therapy, which probably contributes to bone weakening. Fractures tend to occur in the sacrum and pubic bone. Patients develop symptoms of low back pain or pelvic pain but do not develop neurologic findings consistent with cauda equina syndrome, as seen in this patient."
