"). Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a significant risk factor for recurrent stroke in general and during the perioperative period and also increases the risk for a major adverse cardiac event. Historically, it has been recommended to delay elective noncardiac surgery for a minimum of 3 months following stroke or TIA owing to unacceptably high risk for recurrent stroke and impaired cerebral autoregulation during that time frame. However, more recent data show that this exceedingly high risk for recurrent stroke persists longer than 3 months, gradually returning to a new baseline 9 to 12 months after the event, at which point it still remains elevated compared with persons who never had a stroke or TIA. Although surgeries deemed more time sensitive or urgent may proceed after 3 months, it is most prudent to wait at least 6 months after a prior stroke, and possibly as long as 9 months prior to elective procedures. It is also important to note that secondary stroke prophylaxis with antiplatelet agents is often held for prolonged periods before and after spine surgery owing to bleeding risks, rendering the patient at even greater risk for recurrent stroke."
