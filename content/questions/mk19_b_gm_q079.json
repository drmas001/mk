"). The 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for VTE prophylaxis in patients with cancer recommends pharmacologic prophylaxis for hospitalized patients with active cancer in the absence of bleeding or other contraindications. Patients should be offered pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with either unfractionated heparin or LMWH. Prophylaxis should commence in the hours immediately preceding surgery and may be combined with mechanical methods, such as intermittent pneumatic compression. A combined regimen of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis may be superior, especially in the highest-risk patients. Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing major surgery for cancer should be continued for at least 7 to 10 days. Extended prophylaxis with LMWH for up to 4 weeks postoperatively is recommended for patients undergoing major open or laparoscopic abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer who have high-risk features, such as restricted mobility, obesity, or history of VTE, or who have additional risk factors. This patient is undergoing high-risk surgery and has obesity as an additional risk for VTE, and extended prophylaxis is warranted."

Registry data have documented that postoperative VTE is detected after hospital discharge in 54% of cases, with the highest risk corresponding to colorectal and genitourinary cancer surgery. Studies have demonstrated that administration of LMWH for 30 days after the day of surgery reduces the risk for VTE without increasing the risk for bleeding complications."
