"). After bilateral mastectomy for DCIS, neither radiation therapy nor hormonal therapy provides benefit. DCIS is a preinvasive proliferative growth and does not have the ability to metastasize outside of the breast. Treatment is aimed at reducing the risk of local recurrences, of which half are DCIS and half are invasive cancers, the latter of which have the ability to metastasize. Surgical excision is the primary treatment for patients with DCIS and may include either mastectomy, in which the tumor along with essentially all of the normal breast tissue are removed, or lumpectomy, in which just the tumor itself is removed, ensuring a negative margin. There is no difference in long-term survival between the two operative approaches."
