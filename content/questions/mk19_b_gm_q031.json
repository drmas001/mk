Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications are metformin and liraglutide."

"). Guidelines recommend bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI of 40 or greater or for those with a BMI of 35 or greater who have at least one serious weight-related comorbid condition, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, or knee or hip osteoarthritis. Sleeve gastrectomy is accomplished by excising the part of the stomach along the greater curvature, creating an approximately 85% reduction in size of the stomach. It results in restriction of caloric intake via early satiety with a smaller stomach and hormonal (glucagon-like peptide-1 and related hormones) appetite suppression. The smaller gastric surface area also results in less production of ghrelin, an appetite stimulant. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has the most efficacy data and remains superior to other procedures for weight loss, but it also has the highest rate of early postoperative complications. RYGB consists of creating a small proximal gastric pouch separate from the distal stomach and creating a biliopancreatic limb that connects the Roux limb to the gastrojejunostomy. The weight loss with sleeve gastrectomy is less than RYGB surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy, however, is associated with fewer major surgical complications at 30 days than other forms of bariatric surgery. After 5 years, the two bariatric procedures do not differ in regard to health-related quality of life or major complications."
