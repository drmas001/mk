"). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by upper airway narrowing or collapse resulting in cessation (apnea) or reduction (hypopnea) in airflow despite ongoing efforts to breathe. The severity of OSA is measured using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), calculated as the sum of apneas and hypopneas divided by total sleep hours. An AHI of 5 to 15 indicates mild OSA, an AHI of 16 to 30 indicates moderate sleep apnea, and an AHI of more than 30 indicates severe OSA. It is estimated that 24% of men aged 30 to 60 years and 9% of similarly aged women have OSA (AHI of at least 5/hour). CPAP should be considered first-line therapy in any patient who has OSA and associated symptoms, particularly excessive daytime sleepiness. Optimal positive airway pressure therapy may have salutary effects on the cardiovascular diseases associated with OSA. Suboptimal adherence to CPAP is common in clinical practice, and rates of discontinuation are high. Therefore, objective monitoring of use and periodic follow-up are important to ensure adherence."
