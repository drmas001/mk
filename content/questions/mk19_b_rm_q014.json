"). This patient has a clear diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and first-line therapy with NSAIDs has failed. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends the use of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor after failure of a trial of at least two NSAIDs for 2 to 4 weeks each, or if NSAIDs cannot be tolerated. TNF inhibitors, such as etanercept (a fusion protein), adalimumab, or infliximab (monoclonal antibodies), can be used. The selection may depend on the presence of comorbid disease, such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease, where the monoclonal antibodies would be more appropriate. TNF inhibitors have been shown to be disease modifying in AS. Interleukin-17 inhibitors, such as secukinumab, could be used in patients in whom a TNF inhibitor fails or in whom a TNF inhibitor may be contraindicated. The ACR conditionally recommends TNF inhibitors over interleukin-17 inhibitors in patients in whom NSAIDs fail or who cannot tolerate NSAIDs."
