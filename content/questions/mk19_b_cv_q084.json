", elevated central venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, pulmonary edema on the chest radiograph) despite guideline-directed medical therapy. The systolic click and radiation of the murmur to the back suggest posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation (MR) with prolapse (primary MR). Despite these findings, the quantitative echocardiographic data are consistent with moderate MR. However, two-dimensional quantitative echocardiographic data may underestimate the severity of MR. In that case, additional imaging is required. In patients with primary MR, if transthoracic echocardiography provides insufficient or discordant information, current guidelines recommend either transesophageal echocardiography or CMR imaging to assess the severity of MR (class 1 recommendations). This assessment is important in determining whether mitral valve intervention is indicated. Surgical and transcatheter interventions are performed primarily in patients with severe valvular heart disease, but diagnosis, patient education, periodic monitoring, and medical therapy are essential elements in the management of patients with mild to moderate valve dysfunction."
