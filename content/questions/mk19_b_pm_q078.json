", tricuspid regurgitation) of pulmonary hypertension (PH). If PH is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography can estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. However, echocardiography does not confirm the diagnosis of PH because pressure estimation by echocardiography may be inaccurate. Right heart catheterization confirms the diagnosis of PH and is an essential component of the diagnostic evaluation. Guidelines recommend referral of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction to a pulmonary hypertension referral center. Data suggest that patients who are evaluated for pulmonary hypertension outside of pulmonary hypertension referral centers receive an incorrect diagnosis as much as 33% of the time. The evaluation of PH also includes additional testing to identify an underlying cause of PH such as lung disease, left-sided heart failure, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and causes of nocturnal hypoxemia."
