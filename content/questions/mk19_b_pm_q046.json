"A 52-year-old man is evaluated after hospital discharge for total knee arthroplasty. In the recovery room following the procedure, he was reintubated because of hypoxemia, which was then completely resolved. The postintubation chest radiograph was normal. Hypoxemia did not return following extubation 24 hours later, and oxygenation was normal at discharge on hospital day 4. He also has hypertension. Medications are lisinopril and short-term apixaban for postarthroplasty venous thromboembolism prophylaxis."

"). OSA may be clinically recognized for the first time after a procedure that entails general anesthesia and/or narcotics. In this situation, OSA may manifest as repeated episodes of postoperative hypoxemia but may also present as frank respiratory failure. This patient has risk factors for OSA, including obesity, male sex, hypertension, and a thick neck. Many of these risk factors are incorporated into predictive scoring algorithms to identify those individuals before surgery. With increasing use of screening tools and perioperative care pathways, unexpected patient events due to undiagnosed OSA following general anesthesia or opioid analgesics are less common than in the past."
