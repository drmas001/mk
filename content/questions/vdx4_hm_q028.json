"The most likely diagnosis is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). Up to 2% of patients treated with heparin develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and approximately 30% of such patients develop HITT. In patients with HITT, venous thrombi occur two- to fourfold more often than do arterial thrombi, although in patients with underlying arterial disease this ratio is reversed. Thrombi have a propensity to form in areas of vascular damage, such as in vessels in which indwelling catheters have been placed, as in this patient."
