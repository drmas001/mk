"A 64-year-old man is evaluated for recent emergence of involuntary twisting movements of his neck and extremities. Parkinson disease was diagnosed 8 years ago. Mobility and fatigue improve after each dose of carbidopa-levodopa. A few months ago, he started to feel excessive slowness and anxiety 1 hour before each dose of medication and was treated with an increased dose of his carbidopa-levodopa. Now, he has developed involuntary nonrhythmic movements that peak after each dose. Current medication is carbidopa-levodopa."

"). This patient with Parkinson disease has levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Patients with Parkinson disease may develop medication-related complications after a few years of treatment with levodopa. One example is the “wearing-off” phenomenon before each dose of medication due to progressive loss of the ability to store and release dopamine for extended periods. As a result, motor and nonmotor symptoms recur before the next dose of levodopa. Another complication is emergence of choreiform dyskinesia that peaks after each dose of levodopa and is caused by hypersensitization of dopamine receptors in the brain. Amantadine, a glutamate ",

This mode of treatment is indicated for patients who continue to benefit from levodopa but experience motor fluctuations or have a refractory tremor. It can be effective for levodopa-induced motor complications that are refractory to medical management. However, in this patient, amantadine should be tried first because it is effective and noninvasive."
