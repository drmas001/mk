It typically involves the trunk and spreads to the limbs but spares the palms and soles. It occurs during the first or second week of exposure to an offending drug."

"Photosensitive drug reactions tend to be limited to sun-exposed areas. Fixed drug reactions are typically circinate plaques with more limited involvement than is reflected in this image (typically the lips, genitals, face, or fingers). Although Stevens-Johnson syndrome may start as an erythematous macular rash on the trunk, the lack of systemic symptoms or mucocutaneous involvement makes this diagnosis unlikely."
