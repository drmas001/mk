"The most likely diagnosis is aplastic anemia. The biopsy specimen shows profound hypocellularity. Fat and marrow stroma are the major components present, and there is no evidence of malignant cells or fibrosis, as would be seen with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelofibrosis. These bone marrow biopsy findings are consistent with a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia is characterized by diminished or absent hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow, most frequently resulting from injury to the pluripotent stem cell. Such injury may occur secondary to drugs, radiation, infection, or immune disorders or may be idiopathic. The most common peripheral blood pattern seen in aplastic anemia is pancytopenia, with the simultaneous presence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia."
