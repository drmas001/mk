"). Nodular BCC typically presents as a pearly or translucent nodule or papule with arborizing telangiectasias. It may have a central depression or ulceration with a rolled waxy border. About 6% of BCCs are pigmented, such as this one, which has dark brown pigment along the superior border of the tumor and a dot of pigment located at the middle of the inferior border. Pigmented BCCs are more common in patients with darker skin. Pigmented BCCs are a low-risk BCC subtype. However, they can mimic malignant melanoma, and biopsy is necessary to differentiate them. Although they have low mortality, significant local tissue destruction can occur if not treated. Mohs micrographic surgery is a surgical technique that enhances the ability to leave surgical margins free of tumor and at the same time minimize the resection of normal tissue. Compared with standard excision, Mohs micrographic surgery is associated with a reduced rate of tumor recurrence. Mohs micrographic surgery is usually reserved for skin cancers that have a high risk for recurrence or for tumors located in areas where minimal destruction of tissue is of cosmetic or functional importance. For the lesion on this patient's face near the eye, Mohs micrographic surgery would be recommended for the best chance of complete tumor eradication and cosmetic outcomes."
