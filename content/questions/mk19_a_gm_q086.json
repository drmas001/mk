"A 58-year-old man is evaluated at a follow-up appointment. He is feeling well and has no symptoms. Medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He exercises by walking 4 miles daily. He has never smoked and drinks one or two glasses of wine per day. Current medications are lisinopril, metformin, canagliflozin, and aspirin. He is also receiving maximum-dose therapy with atorvastatin and ezetimibe. His baseline LDL cholesterol level before starting atorvastatin and ezetimibe was 220 mg/dL (5.70 mmol/L)."

"). This patient is receiving the maximum statin and ezetimibe doses, has controlled blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and has initiated lifestyle interventions to help decrease his risk for cardiovascular complications. Nonetheless, his LDL cholesterol level remains elevated. The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guideline on the management of blood cholesterol recommends considering the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor in patients aged 40 to 75 years with a baseline LDL cholesterol level of 220 mg/dL (5.70 mmol/L) or higher and who achieve an on-treatment LDL cholesterol level of 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) or higher while receiving maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy. The PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that bind to serine protease PCSK9, a liver enzyme that degrades hepatocyte LDL receptors. PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL cholesterol by 50% to 60%. According to AHA/ACC guidelines, this patient should continue statin therapy in addition to initiating PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. The 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense cholesterol guideline, in contrast to AHA/ACC guidelines, does not recommend PCSK9 inhibitor therapy for primary prevention because of inconclusive evidence of benefit and high cost."

In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD or in patients aged 50 years and older with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus, and one additional ASCVD risk factor, treatment with a statin and icosapent ethyl was associated with a 25% relative risk reduction in the composite end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. Icosapent ethyl may be considered for persistent hypertriglyceridemia once LDL cholesterol levels are optimized. This patient does not have a current indication for icosapent ethyl therapy."
