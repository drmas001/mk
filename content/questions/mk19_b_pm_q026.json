"). This patient has symptoms and clinical findings suggestive of a diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). Nonproductive cough and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms of DPLD. Findings on chest auscultation can be variable, but the presence of inspiratory dry crackles and clubbing is compatible with a DPLD such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Other findings supporting the diagnosis of DPLD include chest radiograph showing small lung volumes, unexplained bibasilar infiltrates, restrictive physiology, and a reduced D",

". HRCT will help confirm the diagnosis of DPLD and may also narrow the differential diagnosis. For example, the addition of expiratory images can help diagnose small airway disease, and prone images can help exclude dependent atelectasis as a potential confounder. In an appropriate clinical setting, typical HRCT findings may obviate the need for lung biopsy."

Although the addition of contrast can help delineate mediastinal lymphadenopathy, there is no suggestion of lymphadenopathy on this patient's chest radiograph."
