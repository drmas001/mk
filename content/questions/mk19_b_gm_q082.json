If administered before 15 years of age, a two-dose series is recommended, whereas a three-dose series is recommended in older individuals. Vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, although no harmful effects have been noted when inadvertently given to pregnant women and pregnancy testing is not necessary before vaccination. This patient received two doses of the HPV vaccine before 15 years of age and does not need a third dose."
