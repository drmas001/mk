"). The patient had a predisposing traumatic injury that healed; however, she then experienced progressively worsening pain and has physical findings of local swelling and tenderness. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is nonspecific; however, based on the clinical presentation, acute osteomyelitis must be considered. Because her symptom duration is greater than 2 weeks, plain radiography may be used to investigate the possibility of osteomyelitis. Plain radiographs are not sufficiently sensitive to exclude the diagnosis, but the findings of cortical destruction accompanied by periosteal reaction, especially when a previous radiograph is available for comparison, are sufficiently specific to confirm the diagnosis and proceed with bone biopsy to establish a microbiologic diagnosis and guide antibiotic therapy selection. Acute osteomyelitis in adults requires a prolonged therapy duration (generally 6 weeks), so guiding antibiotic therapy using bone biopsy culture results is optimal to ensure that the selected therapy is effective."
