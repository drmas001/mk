"). This patient has granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). ANCA-associated vasculitis is suggested by the severe and inflammatory multisystemic illness. Clues that this is GPA specifically include sinus, kidney, and lung involvement; the skin findings (palpable purpura is not specific for GPA but strongly suggests a small-vessel vasculitis); peripheral nervous system involvement (left foot sensory loss); and the presence of antiproteinase-3 antibodies. To confirm the diagnosis and guide management, tissue biopsy (in this case, kidney) may be done if possible. High-dose glucocorticoids plus either rituximab (preferred) or cyclophosphamide is the appropriate treatment for induction of remission in severe organ-threatening or life-threatening GPA. Selected patients may benefit from plasma exchange. Once remission is achieved, patients should receive maintenance therapy consisting of rituximab, methotrexate, or azathioprine; rituximab appears to be most effective for preventing relapse and is guideline preferred. On their own, high-dose glucocorticoids are not sufficient for induction and maintenance treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Mortality rates in patients receiving only glucocorticoids are high. Observational studies from the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated that glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide was associated with a significant improvement in survival, five times that of historical controls, and a lower frequency of relapse."
