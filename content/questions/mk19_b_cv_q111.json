") is the most appropriate treatment. This patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is on optimal guideline-directed medical therapy. CRT is indicated in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, sinus rhythm, and left bundle branch block with a QRS complex of 150 ms or longer (class 1 recommendation). In such patients, CRT is associated with improved LVEF, reduced symptoms, and improved survival rates. Many patients who meet the indication for CRT also meet indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. ICD therapy reduces mortality in patients with NYHA class I to III heart failure symptoms and LVEF less than 35% on optimal medical therapy. This patient meets the criteria for ICD placement, but she may experience substantial improvement in ejection fraction with CRT and may not require or benefit from ICD insertion."

Mitral valve clip placement is reasonable for patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation with heart failure symptoms and a left ventricular end-systolic dimension less than 70 mm and pulmonary artery pressure less than 70 mm Hg. CRT is more likely to improve symptoms and is the most appropriate step for this patient before considering a mitral valve clip."
