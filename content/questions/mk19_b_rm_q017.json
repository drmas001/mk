"). ILD may develop in 50% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those who are seropositive for rheumatoid factor and antiâ€“cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies; clinically significant disease is seen in 10% of patients and contributes to excess mortality. ILD types include bronchiolitis, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and usual interstitial pneumonia. Patients may also have pulmonary rheumatoid nodules. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate are also at risk for possible drug-induced parenchymal lung disease. Nonproductive cough and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms of ILD. Lung examination findings vary and may be normal. Inspiratory fine crackles suggest interstitial fibrosis. The evaluation of suspected ILD includes full pulmonary function testing (restrictive physiology), chest radiography (which may be normal), and high-resolution CT of the chest."

Rheumatoid arthritis pleural effusions are characterized by low glucose, pH, and complement levels, as well as elevated levels of total protein, rheumatoid factor, and lactate dehydrogenase. A pleural effusion large enough to cause dyspnea on exertion is most likely to be associated with absent breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the affected lung field. Inspiratory crackles would not be expected as the only finding."
