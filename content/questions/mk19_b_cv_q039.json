") is the most appropriate management for this patient. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Almost one third of cardiovascular disease deaths are attributable to smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. Even low levels of smoking increase risks for acute myocardial infarction; thus, reducing the number of cigarettes per day does not eliminate risk completely. Smoking cessation substantially reduces cardiovascular risk within 2 years, with risk returning to the level of a nonsmoker after approximately 15 years. Smoking status should be assessed at every visit, and cessation counseling and pharmacologic therapy should be offered to active smokers. Of all the recommended pharmacologic agents approved for smoking cessation, varenicline is the most effective monotherapy. Combination pharmacologic therapy is probably more effective."
