"). A kidney stone >10 mm, as seen in this patient, is unlikely to pass into the bladder and must be removed promptly because there are signs of ureteral obstruction, which can result in kidney damage. Acute management of symptomatic nephrolithiasis is aimed at pain management and facilitation of stone passage. Pain can be relieved by NSAIDs and opioids as needed. Stone passage decreases with increasing size. Only 50% of stones >6 mm will pass, generally within 2 weeks, and stones >10 mm are extremely unlikely to pass spontaneously. Urologic intervention is required in all patients with evidence of infection, acute kidney injury, intractable pain, and stones that fail to pass. The most effective method for removal of this patient's stone is to break it up using either shock wave or laser lithotripsy. The former is noninvasive, whereas the latter is accomplished using an ureteroscope and requires anesthesia. Both methods have similar rates of stone clearance. Laser lithotripsy is more expensive but is associated with less postlithotripsy discomfort."

The data, however, remain controversial and, because risk is minimal, use of tamsulosin to aid in stone passage can still be considered. Trials of assisted passage may last up to 4 weeks. Regardless, this patient's stone is too large to pass into the ureter with or without tamsulosin therapy."
