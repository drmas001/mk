The left popliteal and ankle pulses are absent. Passive range of motion is normal in the left leg, but the patient has significant pain and is unable to actively flex the left knee fully. Left leg sensation is intact. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable."

Acute limb ischemia is most commonly caused by acute thrombosis of a lower extremity artery, stent, or bypass graft. Other causes include thromboembolism, vessel dissection (usually occurring periprocedurally), or trauma. This patient's presentation is consistent with acute limb ischemia due to atrial fibrillationâ€“related thromboembolism, and the most appropriate first steps are to (1) initiate intravenous anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, (2) perform angiography, and (3) establish a plan for reperfusion of the leg."
