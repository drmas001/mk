She has been postmenopausal for 4 years and had three vaginal deliveries between 24 and 30 years of age."

"). Acute-onset urinary incontinence may indicate the presence of a transient, reversible cause. Common causes of acute, transient incontinence include medications (e.g., loop diuretics, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, α-blockers) and urinary tract infection (UTI). Additional causes may include acute urine retention and overflow incontinence, excessively concentrated urine (a bladder irritant), stool impaction, delirium, and impaired mobility. UTI should be suspected in any individual with transient incontinence, and urinalysis should be performed to rule out infection. Although dysuria or hematuria can accompany UTI, absence of such symptoms does not exclude infection."

") is first-line treatment for urge incontinence, which is characterized by urine leakage preceded by a sudden urge to void. It comprises scheduled voiding attempts at intervals shorter than the usual time between incontinence episodes, regardless of the urge to void, with a gradual increase in the time between voids. If an episode of urgency occurs before the designated voiding time, patients are encouraged to use pelvic floor muscle contraction until the urge passes and then proceed with voiding directly afterward. Although this patient's symptoms are consistent with urge incontinence, the acute onset of incontinence suggests a transient, reversible cause, and infection must first be ruled out before any targeted therapies are prescribed."
