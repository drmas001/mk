"). It is important, and sometimes difficult, to distinguish normal training-related adaptive changes of the heart from potentially life-threatening pathologic processes. This distinction affects the patient's ability to continue to participate in athletics as well as the consideration of further testing and treatment. Structural adaptations of the left ventricle in response to rigorous training include dilatation and increased wall thickness; these findings do not necessarily indicate pathology. In a study of elite athletes, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameters ranged from 38 to 66 mm in women (mean, 48 mm) and from 43 to 70 mm in men (mean, 55 mm). Markedly dilated LV chambers (>60 mm) were most common in athletes with higher body mass and those participating in endurance sports. Increased wall thickness is common, but wall thickness greater than 13 mm is uncommon in elite athletes and should raise suspicion for possible underlying pathology. LV diastolic filling in athletes is most often normal but may show enhanced passive LV filling. Abnormal diastolic filling patterns are more common in patients with pathologic conditions. LV ejection fraction is usually normal in athletes."
