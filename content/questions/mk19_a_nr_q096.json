"). This patient exhibits focal myoclonus of the left side of the face, also known as hemifacial spasm. Myoclonus is characterized by brief, shock-like, and jerky contractions that may originate from any part of the nervous system, including the cortex, subcortical structures, spine, or peripheral nerves. Myoclonus can be physiologic (hiccups, hypnic jerks at sleep onset) or pathologic (caused by medications, toxins, or systemic or central disease). Hemifacial spasm is often caused by vascular compression of cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) at its exit zone from the brainstem. Irritation of the facial nerve leads to synchronous activation of the muscles of facial expression that are innervated by this nerve. This condition can be treated with carbamazepine, botulinum toxin injections, and vascular decompression surgery."
