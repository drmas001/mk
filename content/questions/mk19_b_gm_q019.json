"), which typically presents as a pink nodule with a keratin-filled center, giving it a “volcaniform” appearance. Keratoacanthomas grow rapidly (within 4-6 weeks) and are frequently painful. They are considered by many to be a variant of squamous cell carcinoma. After rapid growth, some keratoacanthomas tend to involute. Because keratoacanthomas are difficult to differentiate from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, they are often treated with surgical excision. For this patient with a lesion on the dorsal right hand, Mohs micrographic surgery would most likely be performed."
