"). This patient is at risk for radiation-induced hypothyroidism. Risk factors for radiation-induced hypothyroidism include higher doses and treatment at a younger age. Rates of hypothyroidism may approach 50%. Patients who have received radiation therapy to the thyroid may develop subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism many years or decades later. These patients are also at increased risk for thyroid cancer compared with the general population, although the overall risk remains low. Annual measurement of TSH is recommended in patients who received radiation therapy to the neck or mediastinum. An elevated TSH concentration should be followed by measurement of thyroxine to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Other late effects of irradiation in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors can include an increased risk of breast cancer in women who receive thoracic irradiation, particularly in adolescence and early adulthood. There is also an increased risk of sarcoma and lung cancers."
