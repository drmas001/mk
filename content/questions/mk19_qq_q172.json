"). Elderly patients with a history of dementia are at very high risk for developing delirium during hospitalization. Delirium is an acute state of confusion that may manifest as fluctuations in the level of consciousness and attention, disorganized thinking, perceptual disturbances, and emotional disturbances. A range of toxic, metabolic, or infectious causes may precipitate delirium, but the risk is higher in elderly persons with preexisting cognitive impairment. Prevention involves addressing medical and environmental issues. Urinary catheters are associated with an increased risk for delirium and infection. In the absence of a medical indication for a catheter (such as relieving urinary retention, monitoring fluid status in acutely ill patients when this directly impacts medical treatment, managing stage 3 or 4 pressure injuries on patients' buttocks), the catheter should be removed. Additional nonpharmacologic measures that reduce risk for delirium in elderly patients include cognitive reorientation, sleep enhancement, early mobility, adaptations for visual and hearing impairment, nutrition and fluid repletion, pain management, appropriate medication usage, adequate oxygenation, prevention of constipation, and family or a sitter at the bedside."
