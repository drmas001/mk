He is clinically stable with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure symptoms, and the goal of treatment at this point is to optimize medical therapy to improve his chances of maintaining clinical stability and reducing mortality. Aldosterone antagonist therapy (spironolactone or eplerenone) is indicated in all patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and normal kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m",

"), as these agents have been shown to improve survival in this population. Eplerenone is a more selective aldosterone antagonist than spironolactone; it is associated with fewer endocrine side effects and reduced incidence of gynecomastia (1% vs. 10%). Therefore, although this patient had gynecomastia when taking spironolactone, it is reasonable to try eplerenone as an alternative aldosterone antagonist."

"Valsartan-sacubitril is an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor that improves survival and symptoms in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when compared with ACE inhibitor therapy. Guidelines recommend replacing an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with valsartan-sacubitril in patients who are tolerating therapy with these agents, or initiating therapy with valsartan-sacubitril instead of an ACE inhibitor or ARB for patients with new-onset heart failure. However, valsartan-sacubitril is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema with either ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy.
