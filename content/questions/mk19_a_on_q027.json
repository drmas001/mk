"). Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown in multiple trials to improve survival in patients with resected stage II and stage III non–small cell lung cancer. This survival benefit was confirmed in a large meta-analysis (the LACE meta-analysis), which found that use of a cisplatin-based combination regimen was associated with a clear improvement in survival. Cisplatin can be combined with multiple potential partner agents, none clearly more efficacious than any other. Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically given for four cycles; following that, surveillance is started with periodic CT chest imaging combined with history and physical examination. This patient underwent resection for stage II non–small cell lung cancer, and adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated."
