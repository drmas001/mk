") is the most appropriate diagnostic test for this patient with a superficial fungal infection. This patient has an annular erythematous plaque with scale at the border, which is characteristic of tinea corporis. The rash is likely worsening because of the patient's use of clobetasol, a potent topical glucocorticoid. Microscopic examination of skin scrapings using a KOH preparation is inexpensive and results are yielded quickly, typically within the time frame of the patient's visit. The edge of a glass slide or 15 blade is used to scrape the scale onto a glass slide. Two to three drops of KOH are then placed on the scale, and a coverslip is applied. Diagnosis of tinea is confirmed by the presence of branching hyphae under the microscope, typically at 10- or 20-power magnification, as ",

Shave biopsy can be performed to diagnose tinea infections, but it is more expensive than KOH preparation and it may take 1 to 2 days to receive results. In addition, skin biopsy has potential morbidity, such as scarring and risk for infection. A KOH examination should be performed first and, if negative, a culture (preferred) or shave biopsy could be considered."
