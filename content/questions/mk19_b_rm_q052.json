"). This patient has a recent history of gouty bursitis as well as a history of recurrent episodes of gouty arthritis, tophi, and elevated serum urate. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) strongly recommends initiating urate-lowering therapy for patients with gout and any of the following indications: one or more subcutaneous tophi; evidence of radiographic damage (any modality) attributable to gout; or frequent gout flares, with “frequent” being defined as two or more annually. This patient has two indications for urate-lowering therapy: two or more recurrent episodes per year and tophi. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is strongly recommended by the ACR as first-line urate-lowering therapy in all patients, including those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease, with appropriate dose adjustments. In patients taking allopurinol, the HLA-B*58:01 allele is associated with a markedly elevated risk for acute hypersensitivity reaction, also known as DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome. Testing for the HLA-B*58:01 allele before starting allopurinol is conditionally recommended by the ACR in high-risk populations (including persons of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, and African descent). It is appropriate to continue naproxen as prophylactic therapy for 3 to 6 months along with the initiation of urate-lowering therapy to prevent flares while the serum urate level is lowered."

If it is used to prevent flares during urate-lowering therapy, it should be continued for 3 to 6 months or until serum urate is at target level. This patient has responded to naproxen and therefore does not need additional acute treatment of his gout or additional medication for prevention. Colchicine does not affect the serum urate level."
