"A 63-year-old man is evaluated in the hospital for acute kidney injury following a motor vehicle accident 48 hours ago. He sustained pelvic and rib fractures and a splenic laceration requiring splenectomy. He received isotonic fluids (17 L) plus norepinephrine for blood pressure support. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. During the past 24 hours, urine output fluctuated from 10 to 15 mL/h, with a 24-hour urine output of 280 mL. Medications are vancomycin, ceftazidime, intravenous norepinephrine, and 150 mL/h of intravenous crystalloid fluids."

The diagnosis of ACS should be considered in the setting of abdominal surgery, trauma, intra-abdominal bleeding, ascites, bowel obstruction, ileus, or pancreatitis. It can also be caused by a capillary leak in the setting of sepsis and massive fluid resuscitation. The diagnosis of ACS can be confirmed through measurement of bladder pressure using an indwelling catheter as a surrogate for intra-abdominal pressure measurement. Appropriate treatment includes surgical decompression of the abdominal compartment."
