"). This patient has recent-onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and is undergoing medication titration. β-Blockers should be initiated in all patients with HFrEF. These agents can improve remodeling, increase left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduce hospitalization and mortality when added to ACE inhibitor and diuretic therapy. In contrast to ACE inhibitors, the benefits of β-blocker therapy do not seem to be a class effect, and one of three agents shown to have a mortality benefit (bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate) should be used. β-Blockers are generally well tolerated but should not be started when the patient is acutely decompensated. These agents have negative inotropic properties and may exacerbate heart failure in patients with acute volume overload. β-Blockers should be initiated at low dosages and uptitrated slowly over weeks (not days) until the patient achieves the guideline-directed target dosage or maximum tolerable dosage. The target dosage for carvedilol is 25 mg twice daily (50 mg twice daily if weight >85 kg [187 lb])."
