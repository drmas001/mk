"). Systemic sclerosis, particularly limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, is associated with pulmonary vascular disease caused by direct proliferative effects on the vascular wall that obliterate pulmonary arterioles and capillaries. These changes result in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which eventually leads to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, or cor pulmonale. This patient's symptoms (exertional dyspnea), physical examination findings (jugular venous distention, prominent S",

", and right ventricular heave), and echocardiographic findings (RV enlargement, elevated pulmonary artery pressure) are consistent with PAH. Because echocardiography may underestimate true pulmonary artery pressures, right heart catheterization is required to confirm pulmonary hemodynamics, diagnose PAH, and determine whether there is a specific response to vasodilator infusion, which may help guide therapy."

") provides a noninvasive way to quantify eosinophilic airway inflammation and serves as a complementary tool in the diagnosis and management of lung diseasesâ€”in particular, asthma. Elevated FeNO levels correlate modestly with blood and sputum eosinophilia and can predict glucocorticoid responsiveness in patients with respiratory symptoms. More than half of patients with asthma have eosinophilic (type 2) airway inflammation, and FeNO levels may be useful in patients in whom treatment is being considered. Measurement of FeNO does not assist in the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension."
