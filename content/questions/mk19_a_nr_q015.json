"). The patient has pain with eye movement, unilateral visual deficit, and an afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. These are classic findings of optic neuritis, an inflammation of the optic nerve. The lack of funduscopic examination findings in this patient does not rule out this diagnosis. Acute papillitis (flared appearance of the optic disc caused by inflammatory changes) is only seen when the inflammatory changes occur at the optic nerve head, and optic disc pallor is only seen as a chronic change—occurring weeks to months after an acute optic neuritis event. This patient may have a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS is a first symptomatic episode compatible with demyelination or multiple sclerosis (MS). The cumulative 5-year incidence of clinically definite MS is 30% following a first episode of demyelinating optic neuritis."
