"). Presence of this allele has been associated with a higher incidence of allopurinol hypersensitivity. Testing for this allele is conditionally recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in high-risk populations (including persons of Korean, Han Chinese, Thai, and African descent, in whom HLA-B*58:01 is more common) before initiation of allopurinol given the potential severity of a hypersensitivity reaction. This reaction is heralded by a rash that may progress to DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome (DRESS is also increasingly being referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [DIHS] and drug hypersensitivity syndrome [DHS]). Hypersensitivity to allopurinol may also include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. This patient has risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity, including Han Chinese descent, and should undergo HLA-B*58:01 allele testing. Additional risk factors for severe cutaneous reactions include female sex, history of rash with allopurinol, and concurrent use of thiazide or loop diuretics. Drug hypersensitivity can still occur in patients negative for the HLA-B*58:01 allele, and patients must be counseled to stop the drug immediately if a rash occurs."

Allele testing remains the best choice for this patient. Allopurinol desensitization is conditionally recommended for patients with a previous allergic response to allopurinol who cannot be treated with other oral urate-lowering agents, such as febuxostat or probenecid."
