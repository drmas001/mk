"A 43-year-old man is evaluated for a 6-year history of recurrent, severe migraine occurring every 3 months and lasting 2 to 3 days. He describes the migraine pain, which typically awakens him from sleep, as debilitating, intense, throbbing, and unilateral in location (although alternating sides). The migraine prohibits normal physical activity, such as going to work. For 30 to 45 minutes during a migraine episode, he may experience hemifield visual scotoma and ipsilateral numbness in the face and hand. Photophobia and nausea are intense, and he typically vomits within an hour of awakening on migraine days. Oral sumatriptan, oral rizatriptan, and nasal zolmitriptan have not relieved the pain."

"). The patient's migraine meets International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, diagnostic criteria for migraine with aura. Aura may occur in 20% to 30% of patients with migraine. It frequently precedes pain but also occurs during or without head discomfort. Aura symptoms involve positive (e.g., paresthesia) and negative (e.g., scotomata) neurologic phenomena developing gradually and evolving over a period of 5 to 60 minutes. Resolution is gradual and complete. Typical aura involves any combination of homonymous visual, hemisensory, or language symptoms. This patient has a typical migraine-associated aura. The presence of typical aura does not affect choice of acute migraine therapy, although triptans are contraindicated in the setting of brainstem or hemiplegic auras. Given this patient's migraine with typical aura and the severe migraine present on awakening with rapidly developing vomiting, subcutaneous sumatriptan is an appropriate therapeutic choice."

No red flags are present, and both the headaches and aura symptoms can alternate locations, reducing concerns for a focal lesion. In the presence of a stable clinical pattern of migraine and a normal neurologic examination, guidelines suggest that brain imaging is not indicated."
