") should be done in the evaluation of dementia. Guidelines recommend that patients with evidence of dementia symptoms for less than 3 years should have advanced neuroimaging with noncontrast CT or MRI. Neuroimaging can identify conditions that may be remediable or modifiable, such as cerebrovascular disease, hemorrhage, tumor, and abscess. Neuroimaging can also support the diagnoses of specific dementias, such as Alzheimer disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and hydrocephalus. MRI of the brain supports the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease when it shows evidence of decreased volume of the hippocampi out of proportion to rest of the brain. This patient likely has Alzheimer disease, and although a head CT is acceptable, brain MRI would be better to define the level of atrophy in the hippocampi for this diagnosis."
