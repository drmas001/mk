"). This patient has patellofemoral pain syndrome, which is characterized by pain in the knee that can be localized to the patella or behind the patella and classically occurs with activities that involve knee flexion. Common symptoms include pain with running and going up and down stairs. This syndrome most commonly occurs in women and is a common condition in runners. Weak quadriceps muscles may contribute to the onset of patellofemoral pain syndrome. Diagnosis is based on the history and physical examination findings, which include pain with flexion of the knee, such as pain with squatting. Patellofemoral pain syndrome is not associated with effusions or erythema. Further imaging or evaluation is not necessary. NSAIDs may help alleviate symptoms in the acute setting but have not shown benefit in the long term. In the acute phase of injury, modification of activity and cryotherapy (ice, ice water immersion) is recommended. In the recovery phase, the most effective treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome is physical therapy with an exercise program designed to strengthen the quadriceps muscles, hamstrings, and gluteus muscles. Core strengthening exercises also may have benefit. These strengthening exercises should be continued after pain relief."
