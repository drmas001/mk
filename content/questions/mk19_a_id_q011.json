He is transferred to a hospital bed outside of the ICU. Two months ago, he was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia with negative sputum cultures. Medications are vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin."

" and other fastidious organisms was not excluded. Therefore, the initial empiric regimen of vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin was a reasonable choice. With negative blood and sputum cultures at 48 hours, the likelihood of infection with one of these agents is low, and antibiotics can be de-escalated to one of the standard regimens for CAP in hospitalized patients. Additionally, the patient has improved enough to be transferred outside of the ICU, so it is safe to transition to a regimen for nonsevere pneumonia. Levofloxacin monotherapy, or combination therapy with a Î²-lactam and macrolide regimen, would be an appropriate choice. Levofloxacin monotherapy has the advantage of being an oral regimen, so if the patient were to be discharged before completing 5 days of therapy, he could continue this antibiotic at home."
