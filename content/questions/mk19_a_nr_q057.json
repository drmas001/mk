Subacute onset of chorea is indicative of an acquired cause, whereas a more insidious course would be suggestive of neurodegenerative causes. Pregnancy should be considered as a potential cause of chorea in a young woman. Chorea can emerge early in pregnancy as a result of gestational hormonal changes and usually abates after childbirth. A history of rheumatic fever and antiphospholipid antibodies are risk factors for chorea gravidarum. Other acquired causes of acute or subacute chorea include medications, autoimmune disorders, endocrine disorders, and paraneoplastic syndromes."
