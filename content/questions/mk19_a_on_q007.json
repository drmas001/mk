") is the most appropriate adjuvant management for this patient. The source of cancer in some patients presenting with metastatic cancer is never identified. This group of patients is classified as having cancer of unknown primary (CUP). On identification of metastatic cancer, a full medical history and physical examination should be obtained. In female patients, breast examination and mammography should be done to search for a breast primary cancer, and a gynecologic evaluation should be performed to look for an ovarian primary. Imaging studies typically include contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. For patients with CUP, the identification of a favorable prognostic subgroup allows selection of specific surgical, radiation, or chemotherapy to which patients are more likely to respond. The patient is a woman with CUP who presents with ascites and abdominal carcinomatosis. Although this patient does not have visible abnormalities in her ovaries on CT and no indication of a primary tumor site, she should be presumptively treated for ovarian cancer, which includes debulking the peritoneal tumor followed by chemotherapy, usually with a platinum-based agent and a taxane."
