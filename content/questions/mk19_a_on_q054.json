") is the most accurate and useful imaging modality for staging of patients with a new diagnosis of colon cancer. Staging with the TNM cancer staging system is the first step in treatment planning. Preoperative clinical staging begins with a history to identify localizing symptoms that may represent metastatic disease and physical examination to detect ascites, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation includes serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in addition to routine chemical and metabolic studies. An elevated CEA level indicates a worse prognosis for patients at any stage of colon cancer compared to patients with normal levels. In addition, failure of an elevated CEA level to normalize after resection suggests the continued presence of metastatic disease and need for additional evaluation. A rising CEA level during the surveillance period after surgical resection indicates recurrent disease and the need for diagnostic imaging. Additional staging evaluation includes a full colonoscopy (if possible) and contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis. In addition to imaging the abdomen and pelvis, the chest should be imaged to rule out pulmonary metastases and to establish a baseline for surveillance. This staging approach is endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network."
