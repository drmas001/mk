After definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer, PSA density is used to help with decision-making regarding active surveillance and treatment. This is especially true for asymptomatic men with PSA-only recurrence, as it can take several years for clinical metastatic disease to develop in that setting. PSA density measurement has no role in the evaluation of men with clinical metastatic disease."
