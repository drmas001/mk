"). Sinus bradycardia is the presence of sinus rhythm with a heart rate of less than 60/min. Pathologic sinus bradycardia is most commonly caused by sinus node dysfunction due to age-related myocardial fibrosis. The most common extrinsic cause is medication use. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine modestly improve cognitive performance in patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer disease. However, these drugs can be associated with bradycardia, heart block, and syncope due to drug-related enhanced vagal tone. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be avoided in patients with pre-existing bradycardia or documented conduction disease and should be stopped in patients who develop symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension.
