"). Cardiovascular risk scores can be used to assess a patient's future risk for major cardiovascular events and to identify preventive interventions. The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations can be used to calculate risk. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that adults aged 40 to 75 years without diabetes mellitus and with an LDL cholesterol level of 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.81-4.89 mmol/L) should undergo risk assessment with the Pooled Cohort Equations to classify 10-year risk as low (<5%), borderline (5% to <7.5%), intermediate (≥7.5% to <20%), or high (≥20%). All current ASCVD primary prevention guidelines recommend calculation of the 10-year ASCVD risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations, which are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, include race as a variable in estimating cardiovascular risk. The inclusion of race, a social construct rather than a biologic factor, as a predictor of risk is problematic, and guidelines are likely to evolve to reflect this important concept."
