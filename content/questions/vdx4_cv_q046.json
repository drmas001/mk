"Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, which is characterized by QRS widening, a delta wave, and a short PR interval, is responsible for the findings on this patient's ECG. In Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, an accessory pathway bypasses the atrioventricular node and causes preexcitation, resulting in the short PR interval and delta wave at the beginning of the QRS complex. In this ECG, positive delta waves (initial upsloping of the QRS complex) with a short PR interval are seen in leads I, II, and aVL and precordial leads V",
