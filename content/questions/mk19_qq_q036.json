"). CAAG is an autoimmune disorder that leads to replacement of the normal gastric mucosa by intestinal metaplastic cells. The disease is more common in women older than 60 years and presents with nonspecific symptoms that affect the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. Abnormal vibratory sensation and proprioception may develop due to degeneration of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Patients typically have low vitamin B",

CAAG is commonly associated with chronic thyroiditis and autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison disease, and vitiligo. Diagnosis may require a combination of clinical, serologic, and histologic information. Parietal cell antibodies are sensitive but also may be found in other autoimmune conditions; conversely, intrinsic factor antibodies are highly specific but not sensitive. Upper endoscopy reveals atrophic and polypoid changes, although abnormalities may not be present in the early stages. CAAG is a precancerous condition that increases the risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors.
