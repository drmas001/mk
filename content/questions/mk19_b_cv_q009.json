") in this athlete who presented with rescued sudden cardiac death. Patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias (>30 seconds) or cardiac arrest without a reversible cause have a class 1 recommendation for secondary prevention with ICD placement. Despite her normal left ventricular function, an ICD is warranted before discharge, barring a clear, acute contraindication (e.g., active bacteremia). ICDs are indicated and effective in the setting of secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, even if the cause is not confirmed (unless it is very clear that the cause is acutely reversible and correctable). However, her presentation is not unusual for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited “wear-and-tear” disorder that primarily affects the right ventricle but may be seen in the left. Ventricular arrhythmias are often the initial presentation, and some are very dramatic (as in this case); they are also very likely to recur. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging would be helpful to assess myocardial infiltration, ideally before ICD placement. A major facet of her treatment will be exertional limitation, often a major challenge for patients who are athletes."

However, this patient has yet to have a trial of exertional limitation and/or a β-blocker (e.g., metoprolol), and she is quite young to commit to amiodarone as first-line therapy. Furthermore, amiodarone is not nearly as effective as is an ICD in preventing sudden cardiac death."
