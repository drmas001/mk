"). There are several DPLDs that occur almost exclusively in persons who are current smokers. The pathology from smoking-related DPLD includes respiratory bronchiolitisâ€“associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH), and smoking-related interstitial fibrosis (SRIF). Smoking in conjunction with other endogenous or exogenous factors may also contribute to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as well as combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.

" is reduced in all patients with DPLD, including smoking-related DPLD. Findings on high-resolution CT (HRCT) can often help distinguish between the various types of smoking-related DPLD. This patient's HRCT findings of lower-lobe-predominant ground-glass opacities suggest DIP. RB-ILD is characterized by patchy ground-glass opacities with fine centrilobular nodules. PLCH, in contrast, is characterized by diffuse thin-walled cysts and nodular lesions in the mid- and upper lung zones. SRIF mimics RB-ILD on chest radiograph; however, it is pathologically distinct, with deposition of hyalinized collagen in alveolar septa and minimal inflammation. For all smoking-related DPLDs, smoking cessation is the cornerstone of treatment. Patients should receive behavioral counseling and at least one of seven FDA-approved treatments for smoking cessation."
