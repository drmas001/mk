Approximately 0.5% to 7% of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism progress to overt hyperthyroidism, and 5% to 12% revert to normal thyroid function. The most common cause is toxic multinodular goiter. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk for atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular events, and hip fracture; however, it is unknown whether treatment reduces hip fracture risk. A higher risk for cardiovascular and skeletal complications is seen with serum TSH level less than 0.1 μU/mL (0.1 mU/L), as in this patient. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients with serum TSH levels less than 0.1 μU/mL (0.1 mU/L) and with symptoms, cardiac risk factors, heart disease, or osteoporosis, as well as for postmenopausal women not taking estrogen therapy or bisphosphonates."
