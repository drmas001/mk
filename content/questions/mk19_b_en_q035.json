") is the most appropriate management. This patient has an aggressive papillary thyroid cancer with nodal metastases that is at intermediate to high risk for recurrence. Treatment of intermediate- to high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer includes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression with daily levothyroxine. Thyroid follicular cells, from which papillary and follicular cancers arise, are TSH responsive. To reduce cancer recurrence, a sufficient dose of levothyroxine is administered to suppress the serum TSH below normal. In this patient, the TSH is low and free thyroxine (T",
{

"attrs":{

") is in the normal range; thus, the levothyroxine dose is optimized for a patient with intermediate to high-risk papillary thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is diagnosed in 13.9 per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Mortality rates have remained stable, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 98.1%. Papillary thyroid carcinoma commonly spreads to cervical lymph nodes but is associated with a low risk for distant metastases."

"Surgery is the mainstay of thyroid cancer treatment. Postoperative radioactive iodine is considered for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer at an intermediate to high risk for recurrence (i.e., metastatic disease), as in this patient. After initial cancer treatment, serum thyroglobulin (Tg), a sensitive marker for the detection of persistent or recurrent disease, and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) titers are monitored. Absence of both serum Tg and TgAb, as in this patient, is associated with a favorable prognosis. Thyroid ultrasonography confirms the lack of thyroid cancer recurrence."
