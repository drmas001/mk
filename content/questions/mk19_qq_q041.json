") should be performed next. If the cause of dyspnea remains elusive following completion of standard testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing can be helpful. It can also aid in the evaluation of patients with multiple potential causes of dyspnea. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing involves continuous monitoring of ECG, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and other parameters in addition to more sophisticated measurements of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and work output. Cardiopulmonary testing narrows the differential diagnosis of dyspnea by identifying the physiologic basis for the patient's symptoms. It can also support the diagnosis of deconditioning as a cause of symptoms."

"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure of 25 mm Hg or greater measured during right heart catheterization. The initial symptoms of PH are nonspecific, often consisting of exertional dyspnea and fatigue. If PH is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography should be performed, as it allows an estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure and assessment of both right and left heart size and function.
