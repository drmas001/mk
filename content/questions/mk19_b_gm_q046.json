He has no other medical problems, including no history of gastrointestinal bleeding, upper gastrointestinal pain, uncontrolled hypertension, chronic kidney disease, NSAID use, or thrombocytopenia. Medications are varenicline, metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin."

Daily low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, but the potential benefit must be balanced against the increased risk for bleeding. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of ASCVD because of a lack of net benefit; specifically, low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention of ASCVD in adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk. This patient is not at high risk for bleeding but is at high risk for ASCVD, making low-dose aspirin an appropriate choice."
