"). Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension are at risk for hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension. In hepatopulmonary syndrome, the pulmonary vasculature becomes dilated, resulting in right-to-left shunting of blood and hypoxemia. Patients may present with characteristic findings of orthodeoxia (worsening oxygen saturation while upright) and platypnea (worsening sense of dyspnea when upright). Dyspnea on exertion suggests possible portopulmonary hypertension, wherein increases in pulmonary arterial pressure cause high right-sided heart pressures. This condition is less common than hepatopulmonary syndrome but carries a high mortality rate. Echocardiography is the best initial diagnostic test in a patient with suspected pulmonary hypertension. If the echocardiogram shows high right-side pressures, potential causes of pulmonary hypertension should be evaluated before portopulmonary hypertension is selected as the diagnosis."
