"The skin findings shown are most consistent with cutaneous neurofibromas. The defining characteristics of neurofibromatosis type 1 (von Recklinghausen disease) are multiple cutaneous neurofibromas (benign nerve sheath tumors) and caf√© au lait macules. Cutaneous neurofibromas are recognized as soft, sessile, or pedunculated tumors, with most occurring on the trunk. Neurofibromas vary in number from just a few to several hundred, and they increase in number and size with age. They do not carry an increased risk of malignant transformation but may be cosmetically significant. Other manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 include hypertension, epilepsy, soft tissue sarcomas, cognitive deficits, and hypertension."
