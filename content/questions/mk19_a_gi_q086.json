") pathogens are also possibilities. Traveler's diarrhea usually occurs within the first 2 weeks of travel and is usually self-limited, lasting about 4 days; however, life-threatening volume depletion or severe colitis with systemic manifestations can occur. Some travelers develop chronic diarrhea or a postinfective irritable bowel syndrome. Fluid replacement is the mainstay of treatment, preferably by the oral route, with solutions that contain water, salt, and sugar. Antimotility drugs such as loperamide and diphenoxylate can be used in patients with mild or moderate traveler's diarrhea and as adjuvant therapy in patients treated with antibiotics. Antimotility drugs should be avoided in patients with dysentery (severe diarrhea and bloody stools). Bismuth is another appropriate treatment for traveler's diarrhea because of its antimotility and antimicrobial effects."
