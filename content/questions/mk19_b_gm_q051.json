He runs on a treadmill for 30 to 45 minutes three to four times weekly, and he has no cardiovascular symptoms. The patient's medical history is also significant for coronary artery bypass graft surgery 4 years ago, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Medications are metoprolol, losartan, aspirin, and atorvastatin."

"). This patient with erectile dysfunction (ED) has a history of previously revascularized coronary artery disease. He is currently without cardiovascular symptoms and exercises regularly. According to the Third Princeton Consensus Conference guidelines on the safety of ED treatment in patients with cardiovascular disease, this patient is low risk and can be treated pharmacologically. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil, are first-line pharmacotherapy for ED. All PDE-5 inhibitors have similar efficacy and are FDA approved for on-demand use. Tadalafil, which has a long half-life, is also FDA approved for daily use. It is essential to instruct patients who are prescribed PDE-5 inhibitors on proper use: The medication should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before sexual activity, and efficacy may be decreased if taken after consumption of a high-fat meal. PDE-5 inhibitors should not be prescribed to patients on nitrates because of the risk for hypotension. Similarly, they should be used with caution in the setting of concomitant α-blocker therapy. All patients with ED should also be counseled on exercising regularly, minimizing stress, losing weight if overweight, and smoking cessation."
