"). This patient most likely has a meningioma, a benign tumor that is outside of the brain tissue (extra-axial) but inside the skull (intradural), arising from the dura (meninges). On noncontrast images, meningiomas may be hypointense or isointense and thus not readily seen. The term benign is used with caution in neurology because a histologically benign tumor may still be neurologically morbid because of location and size. No acute treatment is necessary in this case because the patient does not have a history of worrisome focal neurologic symptoms, has a normal neurologic examination, and shows a clear and stable pattern of migraine headaches (throbbing headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea lasting 6 to 8 hours) that are unrelated to the tumor. Because the patient's throbbing headache can occur on either side of her head, and the tingling is on the incorrect side of the body in relationship to the meningioma, the meningioma is most likely an incidental finding in this patient."
