"The most likely diagnosis is pericarditis. Electrocardiographic changes characteristic of acute pericarditis include diffuse ST-segment elevations and a depressed PR interval, both of which are present in this patient's ECG; leads I and II in this ECG demonstrate a depressed PR interval, most notably in the lead II rhythm strip. As pericarditis evolves, the electrocardiographic manifestations change and are classified into stages: Stage 1 is characterized by diffuse ST-segment elevations; stage 2, by “pseudonormalization,” in which the ST segments normalize; stage 3, by diffuse T-wave inversion and possible slightly depressed ST segments; and stage 4, by a return to normal on ECG."
