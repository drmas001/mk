"). This patient has a tumor in the proximal third of the rectum. The tumor is bulky and involves the full thickness through the rectal wall, with bulky perirectal adenopathy. This is a stage III rectal cancer, and optimal standard management would involve the use of all three modalities: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Clinical trials have shown that use of irradiation after surgery has greater toxicity and a higher risk of tumor recurrence in the irradiated field than when irradiation is given before surgery. Whereas a more traditional and still acceptable approach would be to use irradiation followed by surgery and then plan to give chemotherapy afterward, current practice is shifting toward the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy, in which both irradiation and chemotherapy are completed before surgery. Clinical trials have established that 5-fluorouracil given by protracted intravenous infusion or capecitabine is an equally acceptable chemotherapeutic option to be given concurrently with radiation therapy. Careful observation without surgery is becoming more widely accepted as a possible alternative strategy in patients who have a complete clinical response by examination and MRI after chemotherapy and irradiation."

"); a total mesorectal excision is the preferred procedure. The mesorectum is a fatty sheath covering the rectum that contains the regional lymph nodes. A total mesorectal excision entails a sharp dissection of the pelvis outside of the mesorectum to allow removal of the mesorectum fully intact en bloc with the rectum. If local lymph node metastases or full-thickness tumor penetration is found after surgery in patients thought to be stage I preoperatively, then postoperative chemotherapy and irradiation therapy are indicated."
