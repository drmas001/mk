"). Although traditionally associated with children, more than half of cases of pertussis now occur in adolescents and adults. Symptoms in adults may be less severe than the “whooping cough” usually associated with infection in children, and a severe, persistent cough may be the primary clinical manifestation in adults. The incubation period is 7 to 10 days, which is then followed by the catarrhal phase that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks and is characterized by malaise, rhinorrhea, and mild cough. The paroxysmal phase, in which the other symptoms improve but the cough becomes severe, follows. Vigorous inspiration during paroxysms of cough causes the characteristic “whooping” sound, and the episodes of coughing may be severe enough to trigger emesis. This phase may last weeks to months if untreated, followed by the convalescent phase that lasts 1 to 3 months during which the cough slowly resolves. Pertussis is highly communicable, and treatment with a macrolide antibiotic in the first 2 to 3 weeks of infection decreases the severity of symptoms and decreases transmission of disease."
