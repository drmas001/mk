"). TOF is characterized by a large subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD), infundibular and/or valvular pulmonary stenosis, aortic override, and right ventricular hypertrophy. TOF repair involves VSD patch closure and relief of pulmonary stenosis/right ventricular outflow tract obstruction by transannular patch placement. The transannular patch disrupts integrity of the pulmonary valve, resulting in severe pulmonary regurgitation, which in turn causes right heart enlargement, tricuspid regurgitation, exercise limitation, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Pulmonary regurgitation is the most common reason for reoperation after TOF repair. Severe pulmonary regurgitation causes a diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal border that increases in intensity with inspiration. Additional clinical features include a parasternal lift and a soft systolic pulmonary outflow murmur. A single S",
