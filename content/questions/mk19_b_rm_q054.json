". NSAIDs are efficacious in OA and are strongly recommended by the 2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation for hand, hip, and knee OA. However, their adverse-effect profiles make sustained use problematic, especially in older persons and patients with comorbidities. Topical NSAIDs are effective and because of their safety profile are preferred to oral NSAIDs. However, topical NSAIDs are ineffective in the treatment of hip OA. For this patient with hand, knee, and hip OA, oral NSAIDs are the initial treatment of choice. This patient has no risk factors for common contraindications and adverse effects, such as peptic ulcer disease or kidney disease. Hence, piroxicam would be a reasonable choice as initial treatment and may adequately relieve her symptoms. It would also be prudent for the patient to take piroxicam regularly for a limited time and consider taking it as needed in the future."
