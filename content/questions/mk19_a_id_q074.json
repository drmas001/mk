His previous incarceration places him at risk for tuberculosis; if he would have acquired tuberculosis previously, he is also at high risk for progression considering his HIV infection.

Although treatment regimens are effective, several (especially rifamycin-based regimens) have significant interactions with tenofovir alafenamide and integrase inhibitors like bictegravir or dolutegravir. If a diagnosis of latent tuberculosis were established, then treatment would be provided with isoniazid for 6 to 9 months with continuation of current ART or a weekly isoniazid and rifapentine–based regimen for 12 weeks with modification of his current single-tablet ART regimen. The decision to start latent tuberculosis management should not be made without repeating the IGRA first."
