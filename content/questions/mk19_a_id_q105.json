Daily prophylactic antibiotics are effective at reducing the rate of diarrhea, but risks of adverse effects and increasing antimicrobial resistance must be considered before prescribing. In patients with underlying conditions that place them at higher risk of infection or disease complications (e.g., immune compromise, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease) their use should be considered.
