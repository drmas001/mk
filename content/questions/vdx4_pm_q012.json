", a hyperechoic (white) line appears to slide in from the left of the screen and then goes off screen. This intermittent appearance of “lung sliding” with periods of no lung sliding in a single intercostal space is caused by a partially collapsed lung expanding to touch the parietal pleura of the chest during inspiration, then falling away during exhalation. The lung point sign has almost 100% specificity for pneumothorax."

"Pleural effusion would be seen as a stable anechoic region in the chest cavity. Pneumonia would appear as an area of consolidation with B lines. Pneumonia may result in loss of lung sliding due to inflammation and small adhesions but does not typically cause a lung point. Pulmonary fibrosis on lung ultrasonography would result in a thickened, irregular pleural line, in addition to a diffuse B-line pattern. The pleural line is thin and normal in this clip."
