It is particularly helpful for critically ill patients when the use of imaging techniques requiring transport would delay diagnosis. Thoracic ultrasonography can determine the presence or absence of a pneumothorax or pleural effusion and can characterize the lung parenchyma to aid in the detection of heart failure or pneumonia. Potential causes of worsening gas exchange include increasing pleural effusion, development of a pneumothorax, and worsening of underlying pneumonia or heart failure, all of which can be rapidly assessed using point-of-care ultrasonography."

Indications include agitation, undesired movement, and ventilator dyssynchrony. However, use of these agents is not first-line therapy for these conditions and is typically initiated only when sedation and analgesia fail to control these symptoms. However, this patient has not yet been diagnosed with ARDS, and there is likely another more easily reversible cause for this patient's acute decline that can be diagnosed with bedside thoracic ultrasonography."
