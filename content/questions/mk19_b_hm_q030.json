Although venous thromboembolism (VTE) usually includes pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis or Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic venous outflow obstruction) can also occur. Causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome may include hypercoagulable states such as a myeloproliferative neoplasm, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, inflammatory bowel disease, or inherited thrombophilias. Underlying malignancy, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, must be considered. Typical symptoms of Budd-Chiari syndrome include hepatomegaly, ascites, and right-upper-quadrant abdominal pain. Budd-Chiari syndrome is typically diagnosed by ultrasound with Doppler, CT, or MRI in the appropriate clinical setting. Approximately half of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome are diagnosed with an MPN; therefore, patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis (portal vein, splenic vein, hepatic vein, or mesenteric vein thrombosis) should be evaluated for MPNs, including testing for the ",
