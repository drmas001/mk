"). Treatment of venous stasis ulcers consists of local wound care and compression therapy. Infection should be eliminated as a contributing cause of nonhealing venous ulceration. Necrotic tissue should be debrided, and the wound should be covered with a dressing. Various dressings are available, and none stand out as superior in direct comparisons; however, dry gauze should be avoided because it disrupts the formation of granulation tissue when removed. Many patients prefer hydrocolloidal dressings because of ease of application and reduction in pain, when present."

"Compression therapy is an essential component of the treatment of venous stasis ulcers. Before application of compression therapy, measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is recommended to avoid inappropriate application of lower extremity compression in a patient with peripheral artery disease. An absolute contraindication to compression therapy is an ABI of 0.5 or less, although cautious use is advised for any patient with an ABI less than 0.9. There are many options for compression therapy, including multilayered elastic bandage systems, elastic compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression (dynamic compression). Static compression with a zinc oxide paste bandage (e.g., Unna boot) is not as effective as elastic compression or dynamic compression in venous ulcer healing. At times, the choice is determined by the ability of the compression system to accommodate the bulk of the wound dressing. Specialty compression stockings that include a zipper may increase patient adherence and, like multilayered elastic bandage systems, may be easier to apply in the presence of bulky dressings."
