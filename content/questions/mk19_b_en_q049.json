This patient had three laboratory test results consistent with prediabetes in the past 6 months. The development of type 2 diabetes in persons at high risk can be delayed or prevented with modifications to lifestyle (diet, exercise), pharmacologic intervention, or metabolic surgery. The initial step in management of prediabetes should be intensive lifestyle management. Lifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 58% in persons with prediabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends a program for intensive lifestyle behavioral changes that includes at least a 7% weight loss over 6 months and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. Patients with prediabetes should be retested yearly to monitor for the development of type 2 diabetes."

In the Diabetes Prevention Program, metformin was not as effective as lifestyle modification but reduced the incidence of diabetes by 31% compared with placebo and by 18% at 10-year follow-up. Metformin may be considered for prevention of type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes unresponsive to lifestyle modifications, particularly in patients with BMI greater than 35, age younger than 60 years, or a history of gestational diabetes. If this patient fails to lose weight, metformin would be a reasonable addition."
