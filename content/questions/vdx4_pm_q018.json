"This flow-volume curve, which has both an inspiratory and an expiratory plateau, indicates a physiologic pattern of fixed upper airway obstruction; “upper airway” in this case refers to the airway above the level of the carina (the trachea or the larynx). The similar magnitude of the flow rates during inspiration and expiration demonstrates that the obstruction is “fixed” and does not vary depending on the phase of the respiratory cycle. A tracheal stricture composed of inflexible fibrotic tissue is an example of a fixed upper airway obstruction."
