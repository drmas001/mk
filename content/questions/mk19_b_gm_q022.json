") in adults aged 40 to 75 years using the Pooled Cohort Equations. This requires measurement of serum lipid levels to determine risk for an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event. The USPSTF recommendation has shifted away from routine measurement of serum lipid levels and toward identifying adults with a 10-year risk for a cardiovascular event that is 10% or greater. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association also recommends routine assessment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculation of the 10-year risk for ASCVD by using the Pooled Cohort Equations."

"), in the general adult population. The rationale for this recommendation is based on the very low prevalence of carotid stenosis (0.5%-1%) and the resulting high rate of false-positive results yielded by commonly used ultrasonography. Auscultation of the neck for carotid bruits is ineffective for screening as well. Screening for carotid stenosis in asymptomatic patients could lead to harm as a result of complications from unnecessary angiographic studies or endarterectomy."

Similarly, the American College of Physicians recommends against screening low-risk and asymptomatic adults with resting or exercise ECG."
