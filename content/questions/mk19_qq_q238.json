"). Naloxone is an opioid antagonist capable of temporarily reversing life-threatening respiratory depression in opioid overdose. Naloxone is available in injectable forms and as an intranasal spray. Although injectable naloxone may be best reserved for use by trained medical personnel, intranasal naloxone can be safely used on the patient by friends and family members in the event of overdose. It is important to remember that naloxone has a very short half-life, and its antidote effects will usually wear off before the opioid effects are gone; patients should be observed for continued or recurrent signs of respiratory distress, which may require repeated dosing of naloxone. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, CDC, and U.S. Surgeon General all recommend prescribing naloxone for persons at risk, including those recently discharged from emergency departments after opioid overdose, and family members of at-risk patients."

") is a partial opioid agonist used in the treatment and maintenance of sobriety from opioid addiction that has superior ability in reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms. Its combination with naloxone (buprenorphine-naloxone) allows for less abuse potential and respiratory depression in overdose. Buprenorphine prescription is restricted to qualified physicians who have received training and a waiver to practice medication-assisted opioid addiction therapy. Before buprenorphine is prescribed, the patient would need to be assessed for his interest in and willingness to try discontinuing opioid use and participating in addiction treatment."

") is a long-acting benzodiazepine. Shorter-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are the safest and most effective method to manage alcohol withdrawal. After initial dosing to control symptoms acutely, a symptom-triggered approach with standardized instruments should be used to measure the severity of withdrawal and guide treatment. The risk for opioid overdose is increased with higher doses and concurrent benzodiazepine prescription. Benzodiazepines should be avoided if at all possible in patients with opioid use disorder."
