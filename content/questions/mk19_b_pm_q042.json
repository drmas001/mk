"). This patient has a toxic syndrome manifesting as respiratory depression, and there is concern for possible aspiration. The circumstances of the toxic syndrome in this patient are unclear and may involve more than one substance. However, a primary consideration is opioid toxicity, with a background of access to methadone, respiratory depression, miotic pupils, depressed level of consciousness, and a transient response of the respiratory rate to naloxone. In addition to identifying the agents or classes of drugs taken, care of patients who have taken an overdose is primarily supportive; maintenance of airway patency and ventilation is critically important in patients with decreased mental status. This patient's inability to protect the airway and concern for aspiration necessitate airway intubation."

If respiratory depression measurably improves, naloxone can be given in repeated doses or as an intravenous infusion until the opioid is sufficiently metabolized and cleared.
