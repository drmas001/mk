") is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's cough. Evaluation of chronic cough should be performed in a stepwise fashion, beginning with a thorough history, physical examination, and chest radiography, as well as cessation of ACE inhibitors and tobacco, if used. If the initial evaluation does not elicit the cause of cough, a stepwise approach to management should start with a trial of empiric treatment for upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). Intranasal glucocorticoid therapy is first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis–associated UACS; UACS caused by nonallergic rhinitis is treated with first-generation antihistamines and decongestants. Because this patient's cough did not respond to treatment with fluticasone nasal spray for UACS, the next step is evaluation for asthma with spirometry. Cough-variant asthma is diagnosed if spirometry and/or bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing results are abnormal, and symptoms should improve with standard therapy for asthma, including inhaled glucocorticoids."
