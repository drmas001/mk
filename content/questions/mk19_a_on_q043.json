"). Hypercalcemia of malignancy occurs in 20% to 30% of patients with advanced cancer. It is most frequent in patients with myeloma and cancer of the lung, breast, kidney, head, and neck. Patients with severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia should receive isotonic saline volume expansion, which will increase renal perfusion and urine calcium excretion. The administration of isotonic saline at an initial rate of 200 to 300 mL/hour that is then adjusted to maintain the urine output at 100 to 150 mL/hour is a reasonable goal. Calcitonin increases kidney excretion of calcium and decreases bone resorption; it can decrease calcium within several hours in responsive patients. Tachyphylaxis to calcitonin may appear after 24 to 48 hours, so therapy is usually discontinued after this time period. This patient has an elevated serum creatinine level, which is a common complication of hypercalcemia, and intravenous isotonic saline may improve renal function as well."

Patients receiving denosumab should be monitored for the subsequent development of hypocalcemia."
