"). This patient presents with one of the most common types of occupational asthma, bakers' asthma. Occupational asthma includes both asthma caused by exposure to sensitizing or irritant substances in the workplace and preexisting asthma that is exacerbated by these same factors. Typical sensitizing agents are high-molecular-weight substances, such as proteins, that induce an IgE-mediated immunologic response. In bakers' asthma, exposure to proteins in wheat and rye flour is a likely cause. Once sensitized, patients may react to very low levels of exposure. A key clinical indicator is the relationship of symptoms to work exposure; patients often improve on weekends and during time away from work. Spirometry before and after workplace exposures is a cost-effective way to confirm a suspected diagnosis of occupational asthma. Alternatively, serial peak flow measurements can be used. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, treatment consists of reducing exposure to the offending agent through workplace modifications or removing patients from the workplace entirely."

Although this patient's symptoms are similar to those of bronchitis, the symptom duration and improvement away from the workplace suggest a different cause."
