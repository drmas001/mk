"). The patient's history suggests a discrete temporal relationship to an accidental irritant exposure and onset of respiratory symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome is a well-described subset of irritant-induced occupational asthma. This syndrome occurs in patients without preexisting asthma following a single, high-level exposure to fumes, gases, or vapors. The diagnosis requires evidence of asthmatic symptoms for at least 3 months after the exposure and is confirmed by airway obstruction or bronchial hyperreactivity. The SDS includes information on the properties of each chemical on site, along with the physical, health, and environmental health hazards; protective measures; and safety precautions for handling, storing, and transporting the chemical. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires employers to make this information available upon request for employees who work with potentially harmful chemicals. Cleaning products contain volatile chemicals, and acute and chronic inhalation exposures pose respiratory health risks, including asthma.
