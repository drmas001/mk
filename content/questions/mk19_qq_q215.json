") to induce and maintain remission. Crohn disease is an inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal system and can also cause extraintestinal manifestations. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, laboratory studies (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin), and ileocolonoscopic findings. Histology reveals patchy superficial ulcerations; unlike in ulcerative colitis, the rectum is usually unaffected. Microscopic granulomas support the diagnosis but are absent in most patients. More severe forms involve deeper layers of the bowel wall and lead to complications such as strictures and fistulas. Treatment of Crohn disease depends on its severity, location, and complications. Induction of remission in mild disease, particularly in the ileum and right colon, may be achieved with CIR budesonide, but maintenance therapy should be limited to 4 months. In more severe and extensive forms of Crohn disease, particularly those involving the left colon, systemic glucocorticoids may be used to induce remission but not to maintain it."
