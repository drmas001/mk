"). This patient presents with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Prompt reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is indicated. Because rates of achieving vessel patency are higher and more reliable with primary PCI than with thrombolysis, primary PCI is the preferred method of treating STEMI. In addition to the left anterior descending artery culprit lesion, the patient has obstruction to the mid right coronary artery. Approximately 50% of patients with STEMI have other obstructive lesions remote from the area of infarction (“nonculprit” lesions), and revascularization should be considered. In selected hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI and low-complexity multivessel disease, PCI of a nonculprit lesion may be considered at the time of primary PCI to reduce cardiac event rates. In hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI and multivessel disease, such as this patient, staged PCI of a significant noninfarct artery stenosis within a short interval after PCI of the infarct vessel is recommended to reduce the risk for death or myocardial infarction."
