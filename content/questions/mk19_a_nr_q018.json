"A 61-year-old man is evaluated for pain and weakness in his hands and feet. He has a history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome that improved after surgery 1 year ago, but symptoms returned 2 months ago. He has noted progressive pain and numbness below his knees and diminished sweating. He also has episodic light-headedness on standing, dry eyes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy by echocardiography, and erectile dysfunction. Current medications are amlodipine, metoclopramide, artificial tears, and sildenafil."

Weakness in right thumb abductor and bilateral foot dorsiflexors is observed. Sensory loss to temperature and pain below the knees and elbows are noted. Vibration is preserved at the ankles. Deep tendon reflexes are preserved in upper extremities and diminished in lower extremities."

"). Progressive painful axonal polyneuropathy with predominant involvement of small fibers (pain and temperature) and multiorgan dysautonomia is concerning for amyloidosis. Primary amyloidosis is associated with monoclonal proteins, whereas familial amyloidosis is secondary to transthyretin gene mutation. When low ECG voltage accompanies increased myocardial wall thickness on echocardiogram, amyloidosis should be considered. Bilateral involvement of carpal tunnel syndrome and, particularly, recurrence of related symptoms after decompression surgery is suggestive of amyloid neuropathy. Other common symptoms include sluggish pupils, hypohidrosis, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and urinary and erectile dysfunction. Although hereditary amyloidosis is more common in African Americans, it should be considered in all patients and regardless of family history. Amyloidosis is diagnosed by tissue biopsy and familial amyloidosis by additional testing with transthyretin gene sequencing. The recently approved drugs inotersen and patisiran have slowed the progression of hereditary amyloid neuropathy and improved quality of life."
