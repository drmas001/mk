") is the most appropriate treatment. Pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification are appropriate initial choices for treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with obstructive symptoms. Nonvasodilating Î²-blockers and/or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) are first-line choices. For patients with persistent symptoms, adding disopyramide, a class IA antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic activity, to one of the other drugs is a recommended option. Patients receiving guideline-directed medical therapy but with New York Heart Association functional class III to IV heart failure symptoms or recurrent syncope believed to be related to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and an LVOT gradient of 50 mm Hg (resting or provoked) or greater should be considered for SRT. Adult patients in whom surgical septal myectomy is contraindicated or the risk is considered unacceptable because of serious comorbidities or advanced age, alcohol septal ablation, performed at experienced centers, is recommended. This patient is young and without significant comorbidities; thus, he should be considered for surgical septal myectomy."
