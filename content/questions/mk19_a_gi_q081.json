She works as a musician and has concerts on weekends. After her concerts, she eats heavy meals at a late hour and experiences nocturnal symptoms that interfere with sleep. During the week, she has minimal symptoms when she maintains her normal routine. She has no other concerning symptoms. She does not smoke cigarettes."

"). Weight loss and tobacco smoking cessation should be recommended to patients with GERD who are obese and smoke, respectively. Patients with nocturnal GERD should avoid late-evening meals by eating at least 3 hours before bedtime and should elevate the head of the bed. Avoidance of large meals and fatty foods that stay in the stomach for longer periods is also helpful if adherence can be maintained. Drastic changes in the diet are not generally recommended because they are difficult to maintain. However, if a trigger is identified, such as alcohol, it is reasonable to recommend elimination of that trigger from the diet."
