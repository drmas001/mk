") is most likely to establish the cause of this patient's syncope. Orthostatic BP measurements should be performed in all patients with syncope. This patient's syncope occurred after standing up, making this test even more important. A drop in systolic BP greater than 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP greater than 10 mm Hg on immediate standing or after 3 minutes of upright posture is diagnostic of orthostatic hypotension. This patient has diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy and may also have diabetic autonomic neuropathy, which can cause orthostatic hypotension. Other neurodegenerative causes of orthostatic hypotension include amyloidosis, Parkinson disease, and multiple system atrophy. Medications that commonly cause or contribute to orthostatic hypotension include diuretics, Î±-blockers, antihypertensives, and antiparkinson medications."
