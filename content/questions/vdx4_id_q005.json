In the ordinary (classic) form of smallpox, the lesions are synchronous (all in the same stage of development), begin on the oral mucosa and face, and are followed by cutaneous spread to the arms, legs, hands and feet, and trunk. The lesions usually evolve from macules to papules to pustules and finally to scabs. The last reported case of smallpox worldwide occurred in 1977; any new case represents evidence of a bioterrorism attack."
