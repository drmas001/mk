"). Objective testing is required for a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). In-laboratory polysomnography is the gold standard test for mission-critical workers, patients with complicated OSA, and patients with comorbid conditions such as heart failure, neuromuscular disease, and advanced pulmonary disease in which diagnostic and treatment algorithms are more complex. This patient has risk factors for both OSA (male sex, snoring, overweight) and CSA (heart failure and atrial fibrillation). Once the type of apnea is clarified during the diagnostic portion of polysomnography, the technician may then use the most appropriate mode of positive airway pressure therapy and assess the response to treatment."
