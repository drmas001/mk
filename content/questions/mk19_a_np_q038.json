" These bacteria secrete urease, which enzymatically hydrolyzes urea into carbon dioxide and ammonium, which markedly increases urine pH and results in the precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate, also known as struvite. On urinalysis, the urine pH will be >7.5. Struvite crystals are recognized by their coffin-lid appearance. Struvite crystals can rapidly form large stones in the renal pelvis and are responsible for the creation of staghorn calculi, which are stones that bridge two or more renal calyces. Because struvite stones are large and grow rapidly, they do not pass into the ureter to cause pain typical of smaller stones. Struvite stones form most commonly in women, and women are more likely than men to develop upper UTI. Other predisposing conditions include urinary stasis from a neurogenic bladder, as seen in this patient. Patients with infection caused by urea-splitting organisms have the typical signs and symptoms of UTI. However, these stones may become persistently infected despite antibiotic therapy and are a source of significant morbidity and mortality due to sepsis. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the first-line treatment for most patients."
