"). This patient has a classic presentation of seborrheic dermatitis, a common condition characterized by greasy, scaly, yellow to erythematous patches in seborrheic areas (scalp, face, ears, upper chest, axillae, and inguinal folds). On the face, specific areas of involvement include the eyebrows, medial aspects of the cheeks, inter-eyebrow region, and nasal ala. Topical antifungal treatments are first-line treatment. Over-the-counter medications, such as zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide shampoos, are the most cost-effective treatment options to use first. Ketoconazole shampoo and cream are also effective. Patients should apply the shampoo on the skin and allow it to sit for 5 minutes before rinsing it off. Seborrheic dermatitis is believed to be caused by heightened sensitivity to yeasts, such as ",

") is not an appropriate treatment for seborrheic dermatitis or any superficial fungal infection. In 2016, the FDA issued a boxed warning for ketoconazole due to risk of liver and adrenal toxicity and interactions with other medications. The use of systemic ketoconazole is limited to the treatment of susceptible systemic fungal infections (blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and chromomycosis) in patients in whom other, safer antifungal therapies have failed or who are intolerant to such therapies. Rarely, in refractory cases of seborrheic dermatitis, oral antifungals can be considered; in these cases, fluconazole would be preferred because of the lower risk for side effects."
