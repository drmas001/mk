"). Rheumatoid arthritis presents with symmetric, polyarticular inflammatory synovitis and prominently involves the small joints of the hands and feet. These include the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and interphalangeal joints of the toes and metatarsophalangeal joints. RF is found in approximately 70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may be present at the time of disease onset; however, it has limited specificity. Anti-CCP antibodies are also present in 70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but have a specificity of 95%. Positivity for both tests increases the likelihood of rheumatoid arthritis and may assist in early diagnosis."
