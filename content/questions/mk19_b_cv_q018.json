"). The patient's history of intermittent fevers and dyspnea is concerning for infective endocarditis (IE), possibly due to diverticulitis-related episodes of transient bacteremia. Of note, anyone with a bioprosthetic valve is at high risk for endocarditis with any significant episode of bacteremia. This patient has a bioprosthetic valve, symptoms of infection, and a possible source of bacteremia. According to current guidelines, in patients with suspected IE, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended to identify vegetations, characterize the hemodynamic severity of valvular lesions, assess ventricular function and pulmonary pressures, and detect complications. In all patients with known or suspected IE and nondiagnostic TTE results, or if complications have developed or are clinically suspected or if intracardiac device leads are present, TEE is recommended."
