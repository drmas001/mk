"A 44-year-old man is evaluated for a 15-year history of headaches that have become increasingly frequent over the past 6 months, now occurring between 15 and 20 days per month. He describes the headache pain as a global feeling of heaviness or tightness that seems to improve with exercise or distraction. Headaches are often preceded and accompanied by neck tightness. He has had no photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, aura, or neurologic symptoms. Acetaminophen, relaxation training, and cognitive behavioral therapy have been ineffective. NSAIDs caused gastroesophageal reflux symptoms."

"). The most prevalent primary headache condition, tension-type headache is defined as a headache disorder that, unlike migraine, is mild to moderate in intensity and not associated with nausea or severe sensory or neurologic symptoms. Annual population prevalence in the United States is approximately 40% for episodic (<15 days monthly) tension-type headache and 2.5% for its chronic (15 or more days monthly) counterpart. Despite its high population prevalence, tension-type headache comprises only 3% of outpatient headache consultations, most likely because of its nondisabling nature. Pain is typically bilateral, nonpulsatile, and mild to moderate in intensity without aggravation by physical activity. Acetaminophen, aspirin, NSAIDs, and caffeine-containing compounds are typically effective acute treatments for tension-type headache, and many patients self-medicate successfully. Nonpharmacologic treatments have gained popularity as alternative interventions for tension-type headaches in recent years. Psychological treatment strategies, such as relaxation training and cognitive behavioral therapies, are evidence-based and should be considered for all patients with tension-type headache. Available options for prevention of tension-type headache are more limited. Amitriptyline is the only agent shown to be effective in controlled trials; venlafaxine and mirtazapine have more limited data."
