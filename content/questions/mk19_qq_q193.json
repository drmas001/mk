"). Elderly patients with depression, such as this one, may have somatic and vegetative symptoms that are often misattributed to chronic illnesses or dementia. Evaluation for depression is recommended for all adults. The PHQ-9 is validated in elderly adults and has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 92%, with a cutoff score of 10 or greater. The Geriatric Depression Scale has a sensitivity of 80% to 90% and a specificity of 70% to 85% and may be easier to use in patients with cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate depression in elderly patients can be treated with psychotherapy or antidepressant medications. Antidepressants are appropriate for more severe depression, as indicated by a PHQ-9 score of 12 or greater. Second-generation antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as sertraline) and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are recommended as first-line therapy, are generally well tolerated, and are effective. Caution is advised for patients on multiple medications because medication interactions may occur."

Benzodiazepines are no longer recommended for insomnia because of their longer half-lives, addiction risk, and the availability of other safer options, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic/sedatives. In this patient, management of insomnia should focus on the treatment of depression."

Changes in cognitive function may be a symptom of depression in geriatric adults; thus, patients with these changes should also be evaluated for depression. If depression screening is positive, cognitive symptoms can be improved with depression treatment."
