") to evaluate for complications of acid reflux, such as stricture, as well as alternative diagnoses, such as malignancy and eosinophilic esophagitis. Other indications for upper endoscopy in patients with GERD are dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, bleeding, and anemia. GERD is a highly prevalent disease, with the most common symptoms being heartburn and regurgitation. PPIs are the most effective medications in controlling heartburn, but atypical manifestations of GERD (e.g., cough, hoarseness, and chest pain) may also respond to these medications. In addition to medical treatment and surgery (e.g., laparoscopic fundoplication), new therapeutic modalities have been developed in recent years, including the placement of a titanium ring around the lower esophagus and endoluminal treatments (transoral incisionless fundoplication and radiofrequency heat delivered to the muscle of the lower esophagus and cardia)."
