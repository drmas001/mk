"). Patients who are female and older than 50 years are at increased risk for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI); a serum creatinine level greater than 2 mg/dL (177 µmol/L) in this population is also a risk factor. Without an accepted indication for an indwelling urinary catheter, it should be removed. Accurate monitoring of urine output in a critically ill patient is an accepted indication, but this patient is not critically ill. Her fluid status can be assessed by other means (e.g., weight), or the urine may be collected in another manner to measure output. Her history of urinary incontinence alone is also not an indication for an indwelling urinary catheter. Indwelling urinary catheters may be used in the management of stage III or IV or unstageable perineal or sacral pressure ulcers in patients who are incontinent. External catheters (e.g., condom catheters for men or female external urinary collection device with suction for women) can be used for patients with incontinence or increased urination (e.g., diuretic treatment) when frequent toileting does not adequately address the issue. Early removal of urinary catheters should be considered whenever possible."

Patients with indwelling urinary catheters should be assessed daily for signs and symptoms of infection. If present, the catheter should be removed. If symptoms persist after catheter removal, the patient should be evaluated for urinary tract infection."
