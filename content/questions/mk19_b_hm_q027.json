"). For patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) with a low risk for complications, the American Society of Hematology guideline suggests offering home treatment over hospital treatment. Clinical prediction scores have a moderate ability to predict patient outcomes and do not replace clinical judgment. However, they may help to select patients at low risk for complications. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and simplified PESI have been most widely validated. This recommendation does not apply to patients who have other conditions that would require hospitalization, have limited or no support at home, and cannot afford medications or have a history of poor adherence. The simplified PESI assigns 1 point for each of the following: age older than 80 years, history of cardiopulmonary disease, history of cancer, pulse rate 110/min or greater, systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation less than 90%. If none of these criteria are met, the patient is considered low risk, with a 30-day mortality of 1.1%; these patients can be considered for home anticoagulation treatment with either rivaroxaban or apixaban. This patient meets none of the risk criteria, and treatment at home is reasonable."
