") for 5 minutes. Most episodes of epistaxis are anterior and occur in the Kiesselbach plexus, which is the vascular watershed area of the nasal septum. Common local causes are nose picking, trauma, irritants (such as medications, low humidity, foreign bodies, or rhinitis from viral infections or allergies), tumors, septal perforations, vascular malformations, and telangiectasias. Common systemic causes are thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorders, and use of anticoagulants (including antiplatelet therapy). The patient should be advised to use petrolatum to prevent drying of the nares. She should also be advised to use a home humidifier."

"Other first-line treatments for epistaxis include application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. If the bleeding is not controlled with nasal compression and a bleeding source cannot be verified due to the briskness of bleeding, nasal packing should be performed. If the bleeding is controlled enough to perform nasal rhinoscopy, the clot can be removed and the bleeding source identified. The next step is often the use of topical vasoconstrictors, such as oxymetazoline or phenylephrine. If bleeding persists, chemical (silver nitrate) or thermal cautery can be performed after a topical anesthetic is applied. However, only one side of the septum should be treated at any one time to limit the risk for septal perforation."
