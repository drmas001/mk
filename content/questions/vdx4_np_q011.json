"The most likely diagnosis is calciphylaxis (also known as calcific uremic arteriopathy), which manifests in later stages as extremely painful areas of necrosis, as seen in this patient. Earlier stages may appear as livedo reticularis or painful erythematous or violaceous nodules. Calciphylaxis is most commonly seen in persons with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis or advanced chronic kidney disease with an elevated calcium-phosphorous product greater than 70 mg",

". Parathyroid hormone levels are often dramatically elevated as a secondary process in ESKD. Although the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, patients with ESKD exhibit abnormalities in the endothelial cells, which allow for an abnormal deposition of calcium within the lumen of the dermal arterioles. As the calcium deposition increases, small thromboses form that lead to ischemia and infarctions of the overlying tissue. The tissue becomes necrotic, painful, and a potential source for secondary infection that may lead to sepsis and death. Treatment is usually supportive with pain control. Aggressive control of calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone is recommended."
