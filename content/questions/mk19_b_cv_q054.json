Medical history is otherwise significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She has a 50-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. Medications are aspirin, cilostazol, lisinopril, and amlodipine. She was prescribed atorvastatin, but she took the medication for only 1 week after reading that muscle ache is an adverse effect."

"). Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is considered a clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) is recommended in patients with clinical ASCVD for secondary prevention, according to guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC). Patients with PAD who are older than 75 years or intolerant of high-intensity statins should be treated with moderate-intensity statin therapy. Guidelines from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/U.S. Department of Defense recommend at least moderate-intensity statin therapy for the secondary prevention of ASCVD. As many as 45% of patients with PAD are not prescribed or do not fill a prescription for statin medications. Patients with PAD may confuse symptoms of intermittent claudication with adverse effects of statins (namely myalgia), which may contribute to the low adherence rate. The most appropriate treatment is patient education and reintroduction of atorvastatin."

Monotherapy with a bile acid sequestrant is not recommended as a substitute for statin therapy in the secondary prevention of ASCVD."

In patients with ASCVD or other cardiac risk factors on a statin with controlled LDL cholesterol but elevated triglyceride levels (135-499 mg/dL [1.52-5.63 mmol/L]), the addition of icosapent ethyl may be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk. Therapy with icosapent ethyl monotherapy is not recommended for the secondary prevention of ASCVD and is not a substitute for statin therapy."
