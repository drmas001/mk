"). The histologic finding of marked intraepithelial lymphocytosis in the context of a normal-appearing colon is compatible with lymphocytic colitis, a form of microscopic colitis. This form of inflammatory bowel disease comes in two predominant forms: lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. The condition mostly affects middle-aged women and is characterized by abrupt or gradual onset of watery diarrhea that has a relapsing-remitting course over months to years, sometimes accompanied by weight loss and abdominal pain. Microscopic colitis can be idiopathic, but medications, including NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have been associated with its development. Management of microscopic colitis starts with discontinuation of potentially causative medications, in this case ibuprofen. This patient could be advised to substitute acetaminophen or, if that drug is not effective, a trial of topical NSAIDs; gastrointestinal toxicity is much lower with topical NSAIDs because of reduced systemic absorption."
