") is the most appropriate next step in management. Insomnia symptoms are common in older patients, with up to 20% of adults older than 65 years meeting criteria for insomnia disorder. Prevalence is higher in women, especially those who are caregivers. Untreated insomnia has been associated with increased risk for depression, heart disease, and poorly controlled chronic comorbid conditions. Management should preferentially involve nonpharmacologic strategies. CBT-I is delivered in 6 to 10 sessions with a trained therapist and focuses on recognizing and eliminating behaviors that interfere with sleep. Studies support its efficacy in older adults, and it is recommended as first-line therapy by multiple guidelines."
