"). Cognitive impairment, defined as a progressive decline in at least two cognitive domains (memory, attention, language, visuospatial function, and executive function) that negatively affects patient functioning, is increasingly common with older age. Cognitive impairment is associated with increased risk for falls and loss of independence and is a barrier to appropriate control of chronic medical conditions. Screening for cognitive impairment is an important component of comprehensive geriatric assessment. Objective in-office screening should be performed when patients or family members report symptoms concerning for cognitive impairment. The Mini-Cog, which consists of a three-item recall test followed by a clock-drawing test if three-item recall is abnormal, has appropriate test characteristics to reliably identify cognitive impairment. On the basis of this patient's symptoms, it is most appropriate to perform Mini-Cog testing."
