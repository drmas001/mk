") with this patient. Guidance on screening for prostate cancer among men at average risk is controversial and continues to evolve. Early diagnosis has not been shown to reduce morbidity or mortality due to prostate cancer. Screening carries risks related to prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as well as harms from subsequent diagnosis and treatment. PSA testing frequently produces false-positive results, as PSA elevation is seen not only in prostate cancer but also in prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia. This can lead to anxiety and unnecessary prostate biopsies. The harms of biopsies include pain, infection, urinary obstruction, and hematospermia. Screening for prostate cancer also leads to overdiagnosis (the diagnosis of cancer that would not become clinically apparent or caused harm in the patient's lifetime), and treatment of these patients exposes them to potential long-term harms, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction. Thus, all major professional organizations encourage patients to discuss the potential harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening with their physician before making individual decisions. It is reasonable to initiate these conversations at age 50 years with average-risk patients with a life expectancy of at least 10 years."
