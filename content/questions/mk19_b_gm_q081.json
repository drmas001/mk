"). This patient has seborrheic keratoses, the most common benign skin tumors in adults. Typically occurring after middle age, seborrheic keratoses present as warty, “stuck-on” papules or plaques, most commonly on the trunk; they involve only the epidermis. Seborrheic keratoses range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters, are usually hyperpigmented, and range in color from tan to brown or black. The sign of Leser–Trélat is the sudden eruption of numerous seborrheic keratoses and is associated with an internal malignancy. Diagnosis of seborrheic keratoses can usually be made clinically, but shave biopsy can be confirmatory when there is concern for melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Reassurance is typically the appropriate management, but seborrheic keratoses are often treated if irritated or pruritic, such as in this patient, or for cosmetic reasons. Seborrheic keratosis usually become irritated and inflamed owing to chronic friction from clothing, but inflammation of seborrheic keratoses may occur during chemotherapy; cytarabine and docetaxel are the most implicated drugs. When indicated, the most common treatment is cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, but only if the diagnosis is certain. Otherwise, a shave removal and submission for histologic evaluation is most appropriate. Other destructive therapies include curettage, electrodessication, or laser therapy."
