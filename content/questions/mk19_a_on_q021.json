"). Elevated intracranial pressure can result from primary brain malignancies or from brain metastases, which occur in 10% to 20% of adult cancer patients. The most common types of primary cancer that cause brain metastases are lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. Median survival after diagnosis of brain metastases varies from less than 3 months to more than 25 months. Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure include headache, depressed global consciousness, and vomiting, and may include signs and symptoms of herniation. In this patient, morning nausea and headache are symptoms that should prompt concern for increased intracranial pressure, which is confirmed by the funduscopic examination showing papilledema. The characteristic findings of late papilledema as shown in the image include elevation of the optic disc with blurring of the margins and loss of the optic cup. Blood vessels are buried as they course the disc. Multiple flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, resulting from nerve fiber infarction, are present. Glucocorticoids reduce tumor-related vasogenic edema in 75% of patients and often provide rapid symptom improvement. Although this patient will require irradiation, surgery, or both to directly address the new brain metastasis, glucocorticoids should be initiated upon diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure and should not be withheld for a therapeutic plan to be established."
