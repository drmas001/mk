This patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with infective endocarditis (IE), severe aortic regurgitation (murmur, bounding pulses, widened pulse pressure), and heart failure. In addition, the ECG demonstrating prolonged first-degree atrioventricular block is concerning for involvement of the atrioventricular node, which sits close to the aortic valve and may be involved in aortic valve endocarditis, especially if an aortic abscess is present. In patients with IE who present with valve dysfunction resulting in symptoms of heart failure, or IE complicated by heart block, annular or aortic abscess, or destructive penetrating lesions, early surgery during the initial hospitalization and before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics is indicated."
