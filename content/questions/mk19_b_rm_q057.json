"). Leflunomide is highly teratogenic and absolutely contraindicated with pregnancy. During the preconception phase, leflunomide should be discontinued. The active metabolite of leflunomide (teriflunomide) undergoes enterohepatic circulation and has a half-life of nearly 3 weeks. Because 5 half-lives are required for a metabolite to be significantly cleared, leflunomide levels have been detected in the serum months following discontinuation of the drug. Demonstration of undetectable blood levels is needed before conception. An 11-day cholestyramine washout must be used to remove teriflunomide and should be followed up with measurement of leflunomide and its metabolite levels to ensure removal of drug. Management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during pregnancy is complicated."
