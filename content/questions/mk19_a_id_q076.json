She has a history of cardiomyopathy, for which she received a heart transplant 5 years ago; 3 months ago, an episode of rejection occurred, and high-dose glucocorticoids were initiated. At the time of transplantation, studies were significant for donor seropositivity for Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus; the patient was negative for both. Medications are tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."

"). She is immunocompromised and at very high risk for EBV-related complications (donor and recipient EBV and cytomegalovirus mismatch at the time of transplantation, recent intensification of immunosuppression). Her history of weight loss and presence of a mediastinal mass on imaging is also worrisome for malignancy. It is likely that she acquired primary EBV infection from the donated heart in the first year after transplantation, which may have presented as a mononucleosis-like syndrome. Afterward, intensification of ongoing immunosuppression would be the most significant factor in development of PTLD related to EBV infection. A substantial increase in the EBV viral load supports the diagnosis, which can be confirmed with tissue biopsy of the mediastinal mass or involved lymph nodes. Management of EBV-related complications, including PTLD, focuses primarily on reducing immunosuppression; antiviral therapy is not effective. Late-onset PTLD can also be EBV negative."
