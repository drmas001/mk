"). The American Academy of Neurology recommends annual influenza vaccination for all patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) based on the increased risk for infection in patients receiving immunosuppressive/immunomodulating therapy and data that suggest worse MS outcomes in patients who experience frequent infections. Inactivated influenza vaccination and other indicated non-live immunizations are not contraindicated with the use of disease-modifying therapies. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that patients ideally receive other needed immunizations 4 to 6 weeks prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive/immunomodulating therapy and that immunization be delayed in patients during a MS relapse. Pneumococcal vaccination is also recommended in all adults aged 65 years and older and adults aged 19 to 64 years with immunosuppression. Patients should receive either the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) alone or the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at least 1 year later. The interval between PCV15 and PPSV23, however, can be decreased to a minimum of 8 weeks in patients who are immunocompromised."

") used in the adult population include the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), which protects against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y infection, and the MenB vaccine, which protects against serogroup B disease. The quadrivalent conjugate vaccine is used in most patients, whereas the MenB vaccine is reserved for specific high-risk situations. MenACWY is indicated in patients with functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV infection, persistent complement component deficiency, treatment with a complement inhibitor (e.g., eculizumab), or travel to countries hyperendemic for meningococcal disease, and in first-year college students living in residential dormitories. This patient has no indication for meningococcal vaccination."
