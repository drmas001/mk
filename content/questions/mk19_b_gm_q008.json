"). This patient has lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). His age, physical examination findings, and normal urinalysis support benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as the cause of LUTS. BPH is a histologic diagnosis that is found in more than 80% of men aged 70 years or older. The American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) is a validated seven-item questionnaire that can be used to objectively assess LUTS severity and subsequently determine appropriate treatment and treatment response. For patients with bothersome symptoms, such as this patient, pharmacologic treatment is warranted. α-Blockers, such as tamsulosin, are first-line therapy for LUTS secondary to BPH. α-Blockers function by promoting smooth-muscle relaxation in the prostate. Symptom improvement can be seen within 48 hours of initiation, with maximum response within several weeks."

"), are second-line therapy for LUTS secondary to BPH. 5-ARIs function by preventing the conversion of testosterone to dihydroxytestosterone, inhibiting prostate growth. These agents are effective only in patients who have an enlarged prostate; efficacy increases with increasing prostate size. 5-ARIs require several months' use before showing a clinical benefit. 5-ARIs can be initiated when α-blocker therapy alone does not control symptoms or if a patient is intolerant of maximum-dose α-blocker therapy."

This behavioral strategy includes scheduled voiding attempts at intervals shorter than the usual time between incontinence episodes, regardless of the urge to void, with a gradual increase in the time between voids. In patients with cognitive impairment–related functional urinary incontinence, timed voiding with prompting by the caregiver may also be useful. This patient does not report incontinence."
