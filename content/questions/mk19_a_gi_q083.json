Cholangitis is potentially life-threatening; therapy should include immediate antimicrobial therapy targeting Enterobacteriaceae in combination with urgent decompression of the biliary tree with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction. Additionally, cholecystectomy should be performed during initial hospitalization or within 2 weeks to reduce the risk for subsequent complications."

In acute cholangitis, stone location is typically within the common bile duct rather than in the cystic duct (as in acute cholecystitis), and cholecystectomy does not result in decompression of the biliary tree. After the stones are removed with ERCP, elective cholecystectomy should be performed during the initial hospital stay to reduce the risk for additional complications from gallstones."
