"The most likely diagnosis is variable intrathoracic upper airway obstruction. The flow-volume curve shown, which has an expiratory plateau, depicts the typical physiologic pattern of variable intrathoracic upper airway obstruction; “intrathoracic” in this case refers to the area below the thoracic inlet (where respiration-related changes in pleural pressure are transmitted to the airway). Flow is impaired during expiration rather than inspiration because the positive pleural pressure during forced expiration narrows the intrathoracic upper airway, whereas negative pleural pressure during forced inspiration widens the intrathoracic upper airway. An example of a variable intrathoracic obstruction would be a partially obstructing intrathoracic intraluminal tumor that was not circumferential, so that the available airway lumen varied in size during the respiratory cycle."
