"). For acutely hospitalized patients ventilated for more than 24 hours, guidelines suggest protocols to reduce sedation. Sedative-analgesic medications can cause excess sedation and may prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation. In randomized clinical trials, two strategies have been shown to be effective in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and its associated complication. The first strategy consists of intermittent intravenous administration of analgesia without sedatives (analgesia first approach). A second strategy consists of daily interruption of continuous infusion of analgesics and sedatives. Variations of these protocols exist, including targeting light sedation. The optimal strategy is not known, and guidelines offer no preference due to insufficient data, but all have in common periods of time in which the patient is awake. When implemented routinely, protocols that limit sedation or allow spontaneous awakening will decrease the length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and incidence of delirium. In this deeply sedated patient, stopping sedation and analgesics now will allow the fastest decrease in medication levels, thus allowing assessment of the patient."
