"). Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema should be suspected in all patients who do not respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. This patient has fever and worsening dyspnea after completing antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, as well as a pleural effusion associated with recent bacterial pneumonia that is consistent with parapneumonic effusion. Any pleural effusion greater than 1 cm in depth on a lateral decubitus radiograph that is associated with pneumonia should be investigated with diagnostic thoracentesis. The radiograph suggests an uncomplicated, free-flowing effusion, but the ultrasound reveals details (including loculations) that indicate a complicated effusion. Diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed, with the resulting fluid examined for pH, cell count with differential, Gram stain, glucose, and culture; culture bottles should be directly inoculated at the bedside to increase yield. Parapneumonic effusions can be uncomplicated (sterile and free flowing) or complicated (infected and typically loculated). Empyema refers to collection of purulent fluid in the pleural space."
