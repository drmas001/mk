"). Patients with small cell lung cancer have a high risk of developing brain metastases (prophylactic cranial irradiation [PCI]). Given that risk, initial staging should include brain MRI. Following completion of treatment for patients with either extensive or limited-stage small cell lung cancer, the risk of developing brain metastatic lesions remains significant, occurring in up to two thirds of patients following attainment of complete remission with initial treatment. Given this significant risk, PCI has been studied extensively as a means of reducing the risk of brain metastases. PCI refers to radiation treatment given to the whole brain in a patient without brain metastatic disease after the completion of planned cancer treatment. Many studies have addressed use of this treatment, and a meta-analysis of 12 different trials including more than 1500 patients showed that treatment with PCI resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of brain metastases as well as a significant reduction in mortality (this last benefit was only clearly shown for patients with limited-stage disease). Based on these benefits, this is considered a standard component of treatment for patients with either limited or extensive-stage disease who have responded to their initial therapy. Since this treatment was initially pioneered, safety concerns regarding cognitive impairment have been noted, although more modern studies have found that this risk can be mitigated with a lower total dose and a lower fraction dose."
