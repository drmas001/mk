") at the start of treatment to establish a baseline and periodically, every 2 years, while on treatment. Aromatase inhibitors are associated with bone loss and an elevated risk of fracture. The risk of fracture with 5 years of aromatase inhibitor therapy is about 8% to 10%. Patients receiving extended aromatase inhibitor therapy have a higher risk of bone loss and fracture. Consensus guidelines recommend obtaining bone density tests routinely to assess fracture risk. Clinical tools such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool can be used to estimate fracture risk using bone density measurement. Fracture risk informs management strategies for osteoporosis and osteopenia, including use of supplemental vitamin D and/or a bone-modifying agent such as a bisphosphonate."

Echocardiograms are performed before receipt of cardiotoxic chemotherapy such as anthracyclines or trastuzumab. Patients with higher cumulative doses and evidence of reduced ejection fraction should have a cardiology consultation. For asymptomatic patients treated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–targeted therapy, routine testing posttherapy is not recommended. Potential complications of radiation therapy include coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, pericardial disease, and arrhythmias. However, there is no consensus on cardiac testing in asymptomatic patients after chest irradiation."
