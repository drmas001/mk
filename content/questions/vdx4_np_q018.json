"Acute pyelonephritis is the most likely diagnosis. Leukocyte casts are most consistent with a tubulointerstitial disease or pyelonephritis, although they are occasionally seen in glomerular disorders. These casts are characterized by a tubular structure that contains cellular elements with clearly visible intracellular granules and multilobular nuclei. Pyelonephritis is a type of tubulointerstitial nephritis in which the interstitium is inflamed with neutrophilic infiltration as opposed to eosinophilic or lymphocytic infiltration, as occurs in cases of allergic interstitial nephritis."
