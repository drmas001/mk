"). The relative benefit of revascularization depends on a patient's underlying clinical and anatomic features. The goal of revascularization in stable syndromes is generally to relieve angina and improve quality of life. This patient has stable but persistent symptoms in the setting of documented moderate ischemia and two-vessel coronary artery disease with preserved left ventricular function. Revascularization with CABG (or percutaneous coronary intervention) and continued medical therapy have the potential to improve symptoms and would be the primary reason to proceed with revascularization in this patient with persistent symptoms despite maximally tolerated medical therapy. CABG with optimal medical therapy is generally recommended for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, particularly in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction and/or diabetes mellitus, because it results in decreased recurrence of angina and lower rates of major cardiovascular events compared with percutaneous intervention or medical therapy alone."
