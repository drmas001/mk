"). The development of Budd-Chiari syndrome is heralded by right-upper-quadrant abdominal discomfort, hepatomegaly, and ascites. Thrombosis of the hepatic veins leads to hepatic congestion and increased portal pressures, resulting in ascites. Risk factors for Budd-Chiari syndrome include hypercoagulable states, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, pregnancy, and the use of oral contraceptives. Budd-Chiari syndrome can be diagnosed with Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen, which demonstrates absence of flow in the hepatic veins as well as hepatic congestion. Typically, the caudate lobe of the liver will develop hypertrophy because the venous drainage of this segment of the liver is directly into the inferior vena cava rather than through the hepatic veins. Long-term anticoagulation is required in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome, although bleeding risks are significant in patients with acute or chronic liver disease, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices. Angioplasty of the hepatic veins and/or placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can be used to reestablish adequate hepatic venous drainage. If liver failure develops, liver transplantation may be considered."

") is not helpful when there is concern for vascular disease in the abdomen. Intravenous contrast is essential for evaluating the patency of the hepatic artery, portal veins, and hepatic veins. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT can help elucidate the extent of vascular thrombosis and potential use of a TIPS for opening the hepatic veins to decompress the liver; without intravenous contrast, however, CT would not be appropriate in this setting. In most patients, Doppler ultrasonography is adequate for evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome and does not require contrast administration or radiation exposure."
