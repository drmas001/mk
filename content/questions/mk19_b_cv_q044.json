"). He has altered mental status and hypotension in the setting of profound bradycardia. According to the advanced cardiovascular life support algorithm for bradycardia in patients with a pulse, atropine is the most appropriate first step. It may acutely improve heart rate and perfusion but will likely require repeat dosing if effective. Alternatives include intravenous dopamine or epinephrine or transcutaneous pacing, which is painful. Ultimately, the goal is to determine the underlying cause of his acute condition. The bradycardia may be either the cause or the result of his decompensation. Pathologic sinus bradycardia is most commonly caused by sinus node dysfunction due to age-related myocardial fibrosis. Less commonly, sinus node dysfunction may result from right coronary ischemia, hypothyroidism, intracranial hypertension, postoperative scarring or fibrosis from cardiothoracic surgery, or infiltrative or inflammatory disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis). The most common extrinsic cause is medication use (β-blockers, donepezil, neostigmine, pyridostigmine). Permanent pacing may be indicated eventually."
