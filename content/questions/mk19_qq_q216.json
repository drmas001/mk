") is a reasonable initial option for this patient's painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The typical presentation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy is an ascending bilateral “stocking and glove” distribution. Damage to the small nerve fibers may result in pain, numbness, burning, and tingling and may impair light touch and temperature sensations. Damage to the large nerve fibers leads to abnormal vibration sensation and proprioception. Diminished or loss of ankle reflexes is commonly seen early with diabetic polyneuropathy. Motor weakness may occur as the polyneuropathy progresses. The goal of treatment of diabetic neuropathy is symptom control. The American Diabetes Association recommends duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin as initial therapy for neuropathic pain. The American Academy of Neurology recommends tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and sodium channel blockers. Of these agents, only pregabalin and duloxetine are FDA approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. The 8% capsaicin patch is FDA approved for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy of the feet. Opioids, tramadol, or tapentadol are not recommended. Few head-to-head comparison trials of these drugs for distal symmetric polyneuropathy exist; thus, selection must consider the potential risks and benefits associated with each drug for an individual patient. Duloxetine has fewer risks than a tricyclic antidepressant for this patient, given her cardiac history."
