"The most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a condition commonly associated with dysphagia and food bolus obstruction. The macroscopic findings of EoE at endoscopy are nonspecific, but mucosal furrowing, appearing as stacked esophageal rings, white specks, and mucosal friability, has been consistently described. Most patients are diagnosed between the second and fifth decades of life; EoE is more commonly seen in men. Patients often have other atopic conditions, such as asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, and seasonal or food allergies."
