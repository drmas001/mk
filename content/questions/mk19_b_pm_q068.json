"). The patient may have sepsis based on tachycardia, fever, and hypotension in the setting of a known or suspected infection. The diagnosis of septic shock may be confirmed by the results of laboratory studies and response to fluid resuscitation. In 2018 the Surviving Sepsis Campaign supported the development of separately created time-based performance improvement metrics to be achieved in the form of a sepsis “bundle” to be administered within 1 hour of sepsis recognition. The hour-1 bundle includes initiating fluid resuscitation, obtaining blood cultures, checking serum lactate level, and administering appropriate antibiotics. In this patient, fluid resuscitation has been initiated, blood cultures have been obtained, and serum lactate level is pending; the only other item in the bundle that needs to be addressed is the immediate administration of appropriate antibiotics."

"In patients with suspected sepsis and hypotension, early resuscitation with 30 mL/kg of crystalloid solution is indicated and should be initiated as part of the hour-1 bundle.
