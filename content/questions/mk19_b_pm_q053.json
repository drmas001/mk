"). He is likely experiencing acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a variceal hemorrhage with subsequent hypovolemia and hypotension. In patients with cirrhosis, variceal hemorrhage carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate is decreased with a restrictive transfusion strategy, defined as a hemoglobin goal of 7 to 9 g/dL (70-90 g/L), compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. However, different thresholds and hemoglobin levels may trigger transfusion in actively bleeding patients who are in shock. Higher hemoglobin values may also be desirable in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic cardiovascular disease. In patients with portal hypertension, transfusion to higher values (10 g/dL [100 g/L] or higher) can rapidly increase portal pressure, putting the patient at significant risk for rebleeding. In addition to PRBCs, early resuscitation with crystalloid fluids is indicated to provide vascular support while waiting for blood products."

However, balloon tamponade carries several risks, including esophageal rupture and ulceration, and should be used only in cases of life-threatening hemorrhage and only until alternative hemostasis methods can be employed.
