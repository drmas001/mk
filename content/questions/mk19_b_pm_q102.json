"). Asthma exacerbation is an acute worsening of symptoms or lung function from baseline that necessitates a step up in therapy. Prompt recognition and treatment of asthma exacerbations are needed to relieve symptoms and prevent hospitalizations. All patients with asthma should have a written asthma management plan that helps them recognize the symptoms of an exacerbation and begin self-treatment. If symptoms do not improve with self-treatment, evaluation is appropriate. Clinicians should screen for patient factors that contribute to an increased risk of death from asthma and should counsel patients appropriately. Important risk factors include a history of near-fatal asthma attack or intubation; an emergency department or hospital visit in the last 12 months; poor asthma medication adherence or not using inhaled glucocorticoid; current or recent treatment with an oral glucocorticoid; psychosocial stressors or psychiatric disease; food allergy; and overuse of a short-acting Î²",

"-agonist. On physical examination, signs of a severe asthma exacerbation that should prompt aggressive intervention and hospitalization include being unable to speak in full sentences; use of accessory muscles of respiration; respiration rate greater than 30/min, heart rate greater than 120/min; oxygen saturation less than 90% with the patient breathing ambient air; and agitation, confusion, or drowsiness. This patient does not have any signs of or risk factors for a severe asthma exacerbation; therefore, she can be safely managed as an outpatient. The best next step is to begin an oral glucocorticoid such as prednisone for a period of 5 to 7 days."
