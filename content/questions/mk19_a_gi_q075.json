"). Hepatic encephalopathy is a common manifestation of cirrhosis and results from insufficient liver function and portosystemic shunting. Manifestations include behavioral, cognitive, and motor abnormalities. Severity ranges from mild changes of psychomotor slowing to frank coma. Hepatic encephalopathy indicates decompensation of liver disease and signals worsening liver function. Immediate management centers on identifying precipitating factors and administering medications, such as lactulose, that decrease absorption of toxins, such as ammonia, from the colon. Common precipitants of hepatic encephalopathy include infections; gastrointestinal bleeding; exposure to toxins, such as alcohol; and medications with sedating properties, such as benzodiazepines and opiate analgesics. Use of these medications in patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy must be discontinued. Identification of culprit drug exposures may involve a careful review of mediations with family members, including medications that were prescribed by other clinicians or that were not prescribed but are being used by the patient, such as opioids or benzodiazepines."

However, the risk for intracerebral hemorrhage is increased in this patient group, and the symptoms may be indistinguishable; therefore, brain imaging may be part of the diagnostic workup based on clinical suspicion. However, this patient has a history of anxiety and alcoholism, and a careful review of medications and exposure to other toxins, such as alcohol or opioids, is the appropriate next step in his evaluation."

Neuropsychiatric testing will be of no value in this patient with overt encephalopathy."
