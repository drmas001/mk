"). Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after 1 year of consistent and unprotected intercourse, and an evaluation for underlying causes of infertility is recommended. However, an evaluation after 6 months in a woman older than 35 years is reasonable. Ovulatory disorders are the most common cause of female infertility, so the first step in evaluation is to obtain a midluteal phase serum progesterone level, which is the best test to assess ovulatory function. The test is performed 1 week before expected menses, and a level greater than 3 ng/mL (9.5 nmol/L) is evidence of recent ovulation. If a midluteal phase progesterone is normal, further evaluation is needed for tubal patency and uterine abnormalities. Hysterosalpingography is used to assess for tubal occlusion and to evaluate the uterine cavity."

"The frequency of intercourse is important to discuss with all patients because the chance of pregnancy increases with the frequency of intercourse and is highest with intercourse every 1 to 2 days. In this case, the couple has had unprotected intercourse for more than 12 months with the appropriate frequency, so an evaluation is appropriate now. Recommending an additional 12 months of intercourse should not be substituted for an evaluation of infertility (",

") is the first step in evaluation of male infertility. Because semen analysis was normal for the patient's partner and he has fathered two children, which points away from male causes of infertility, repeat semen analysis is not the correct choice. If an initial semen analysis is abnormal, however, a repeat test is recommended to ensure collection after 2 to 3 days of sexual abstinence (longer timeframes can result in decreased sperm motility). If repeat results are abnormal, referral to a male fertility specialist is recommended."
