"). The Rome IV criteria for diagnosis of IBS require symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain at least 1 day per week for a period of 3 months, along with at least two of the following three criteria: pain related to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool consistency. IBS can then be further subtyped as IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C), IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M), or IBS unclassified. In IBS-C, more than 25% of the stools are hard and less than 25% are loose. IBS is more common in women, particularly those younger than 50 years. Alarm symptoms, including weight loss, fever, bloody stools, and family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, are indications for additional evaluation. In contrast, low-risk patients with a diagnosis established by the aforementioned criteria do not benefit from extensive laboratory or endoscopic investigations. Patients with IBS-C are often initially advised to use psyllium (soluble fiber) and avoid dietary FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). If constipation persists, polyethylene glycol often is used. Lubiprostone, plecanatide, or linaclotide may subsequently be recommended for refractory constipation. Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, is a prosecretory agent strongly recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association for the treatment of IBS-C based on high-quality evidence."
