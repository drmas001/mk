Her most recent dose of denosumab was 6 months ago. Other medications are amlodipine, aspirin, and atorvastatin."

"). Because the patient remains at high risk for recurrent fracture, continued pharmacologic therapy is indicated. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast activation. When administered subcutaneously twice yearly, denosumab suppresses bone resorption, increases bone density, and reduces the incidence of osteoporotic fractures in both men and women. The optimum duration of denosumab use is unknown; notably, however, fracture rates are comparable over 10 years to those treated for 3 years in clinical trials, suggesting continued benefit for up to 10 years if denosumab therapy is followed by an alternative antiresorptive therapy."

") is not indicated because denosumab should not be stopped without the addition of antiresorptive therapy. A delay or discontinuation in denosumab therapy results in a rebound in bone turnover, a rapid drop in bone mineral density, and an increased fracture risk. Alternative antiresorptive therapy, ideally an oral bisphosphonate, should be initiated 6 months after denosumab is discontinued, but this option is not viable for this patient who has demonstrated intolerance. Although less effective than oral bisphosphonates, intravenous zoledronic acid administered 6 months after the last denosumab treatment results in less bone loss than no therapy."
