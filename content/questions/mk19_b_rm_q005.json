"). The test assesses for the presence of the HLA-B27 antigen on the surface of cells and not the presence of the actual gene. This patient has inflammatory low back pain manifesting as night pain, morning stiffness, and pain that improves with activity. He also has enthesitis of the Achilles tendon, which is seen in spondyloarthritis. A positive HLA-B27 antigen test result in the setting of a compelling clinical picture confirms the diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis. If the HLA-B27 antigen result is negative, MRI of the pelvis to evaluate for sacroiliac joint inflammation is warranted. In a patient with inflammatory low back pain and a positive HLA-B27 antigen result but no other features of spondyloarthritis, MRI is also indicated. In general, HLA-B27 antigen testing adds probabilistic certainty to the evaluation of low back pain. If diagnostic certainty is already high (i.e., the patient has many features of spondyloarthritis), then a positive test result adds little to the posttest probability; if there are few features of spondyloarthritis, then a positive HLA-B27 antigen result is helpful."
