") to increase her caloric intake and decrease her exercise activity. She has clinical features and laboratory findings consistent with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). FHA is a cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and often presents with amenorrhea in the setting of excess exercise/energy expenditure or decreased caloric intake. FHA is caused by disruption of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, which leads to decreased gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) levels. This decrease prevents normal follicular development and causes anovulation and low estradiol levels. The diagnosis of FHA is based on low serum gonadotropin and estradiol levels in addition to amenorrhea in the setting of extreme exercise, weight loss, or stress. FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, it is important to rule out other causes of secondary amenorrhea, such as pregnancy, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, and primary ovarian insufficiency. If hyperandrogenism (e.g., hirsutism, virilization) is evident, evaluation for an androgen-producing tumor, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercortisolism, and polycystic ovary syndrome should be pursued. Treatment for FHA centers on reducing the stressors that led to gonadotropin-releasing hormone disruption, such as extreme exercise, severe calorie restriction, or low body weight. The first step in management is increased caloric intake to match energy expenditure and to reduce exercise. Other effective interventions are stress reduction and behavioral therapy."
