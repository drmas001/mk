"). Diverticulitis results from obstruction at the diverticular neck by fecal matter, leading to mucus accumulation, bacterial overgrowth, and inflammation. Left lower quadrant pain is the most common clinical manifestation and is often accompanied by fever. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. An elevated leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level, or procalcitonin level supports the diagnosis. Diverticulitis may be diagnosed based on the history and physical examination, but imaging is helpful and can predict failure of medical treatment and development of complications. Although uncomplicated diverticulitis traditionally has been treated with oral antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, current guidelines based on high-quality evidence strongly recommend that antibiotics be avoided in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. The supporting evidence for this recommendation implies that such patients include otherwise healthy adults with early diverticular disease. Immunocompromised patients and those with systemic infection or associated comorbidities should be treated with antibiotics."

") should be avoided in the acute setting because of the increased risk for perforation and potential worsening of inflammation. Colonoscopy is advised after resolution of an episode of complicated diverticulitis and after resolution of a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Colonoscopy should be delayed by 6 to 8 weeks after an acute episode or until complete resolution of the acute symptoms, whichever is longer, unless there are alarm features suggesting colon cancer."
