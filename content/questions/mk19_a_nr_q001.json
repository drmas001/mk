"A 25-year-old man is evaluated for a 1-year history of headaches. He recently returned from active military duty where he sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). A CT scan obtained after injury was normal. Headaches, which started soon after the TBI, typically occur three times weekly, last 24 hours, and are bifrontal, dull, and moderate in intensity. The patient also reports occasional photosensitivity accompanying the headaches but has had no nausea, phonophobia, visual disturbances, or neurologic symptoms. He takes ibuprofen as needed to relieve the pain."

"). He is a returning military service member with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and persistent posttraumatic headaches. Although headache is the most common symptom after a mild TBI, persons with this diagnosis also may experience other symptoms, such as dizziness, memory or cognitive impairment, insomnia, and mood and anxiety disorders. The incidence of mild TBI in military service personnel is high. Falls, vehicular accidents, and head trauma from explosions and weaponry are common mechanisms of injury. Those with mild TBI sustained during active military duty appear to be particularly susceptible to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Given the high prevalence of depression and the increased risk for suicide in returning military personnel with mild TBI, screening for depression is mandatory. The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a validated and widely used depression screening tool for detection of depression. Its benefits include brevity and ease of use. Military personnel who screen positive for depression should be asked about suicidal ideation and intent. Screening for PTSD using tools such as the Primary Care PTSD Screen and the PTSD Checklist should also occur."
