"). Current guidelines suggest treating patients with stable angina with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for at least 6 months after elective drug-eluting stent (DES) placement, although the optimal duration for any patient should be selected on the basis of the patient's relative risk for thrombotic and/or ischemic complications. Factors associated with increased bleeding risk include advanced age; female sex; anemia; low body weight; chronic kidney disease (CKD); diabetes mellitus; and concomitant therapy with glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, or oral anticoagulant therapy. Risks for ischemic or thrombotic complications include a complex or suboptimal outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an acute coronary syndrome, left ventricular dysfunction, extensive coronary disease/ischemic history, advanced age, diabetes mellitus, and CKD. Current guidelines suggest that at least 3 months of DAPT in patients at high risk for bleeding may be reasonable. This patient has several conditions with increased risk for bleeding; after 4 months of DAPT, discontinuation of clopidogrel is a reasonable consideration."
