"). The patient has had a minor ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 3) due to high-grade stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. He is receiving the most appropriate medical therapy, including aspirin and a high-intensity statin. In the long term, the patient will require control of hypertension. A target blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg is considered a reasonable therapeutic target for most patients. In the first 48 hours, however, and especially in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis, lowering blood pressure is associated with neurologic worsening."

") are not appropriate because blood pressure lowering in the acute setting is associated with neurologic worsening. Acute lowering of blood pressure is indicated if clinical findings suggest end-organ damage, including active ischemic coronary disease, heart failure, aortic dissection, or hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment in the acute setting is also indicated in patients who are receiving intravenous alteplase, to maintain the blood pressure less than 180/105 mm Hg. In others, treatment is indicated if blood pressure exceeds 220/120 mm Hg. In these patients, it might be reasonable to lower blood pressure by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke. For this patient with recent minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) should be initiated early (at least within 7 days of onset) and continued for 21 to 90 days, followed by aspirin to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke."
