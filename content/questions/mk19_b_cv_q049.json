TTE is the mainstay of noninvasive imaging to detect structural heart abnormalities and to evaluate new or worsening murmurs.

TTE also allows for evaluation of hemodynamic and functional consequences of valvular heart disease, which will assist in managing this patient."

") is not the most appropriate next step for this patient because it is unnecessarily invasive at this point in her evaluation. TEE is usually performed if TTE image quality is low; it also can be particularly helpful if an evaluation of left atrial appendage thrombus or a cardioembolic source is indicated or when there is suspicion of endocarditis, prosthetic valve dysfunction, or aortic disease. TEE is also useful in patients with moderate or severe aortic regurgitation and suboptimal TTE images or a discrepancy between clinical and TTE findings."
