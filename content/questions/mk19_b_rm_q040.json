"). In addition to discussing the diagnosis at length and providing education regarding nonpharmacologic recommendations, such as low-impact aerobic exercise, a medication is warranted. Choice of pharmacologic therapy is based on symptom profile, patient comorbidities, and medication adverse effects because few trials have directly compared the efficacy of medications. Of the available choices, duloxetine (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) is most appropriate for a patient with fibromyalgia and comorbid depression and anxiety because it is FDA approved for these indications as well. Duloxetine should be started at 30 mg/d and titrated to 60 mg/d after a week or so to mitigate nausea, a frequent early adverse effect that usually dissipates over time. If the drug is stopped, a slow taper should be used because withdrawal symptoms often occur with sudden discontinuation. Patients should be made aware that benefits of the medication will not be seen for several weeks. To measure interval improvement, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (a validated clinical tool) or other validated clinical tool should be completed before and an appropriate time after an intervention to assess change in clinical status."
