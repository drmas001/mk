" because some patients do not have a documented inflammatory phase of disease. Risk factors for colonic ischemia include age (>60 years), female sex, vasoconstrictive and antihypertension medications, constipation, and thrombophilia. Colonic ischemia presents with abrupt onset of lower abdominal discomfort that is mild to moderate and cramping, followed within 24 hours by hematochezia (passage of fresh blood or clots from the colon). Physical examination usually reveals lower abdominal tenderness over the involved colonic segment without peritoneal signs. Leukocyte count and blood urea nitrogen may be mildly elevated. Abdominal CT is indicated to assess the severity, phase, and distribution of colonic ischemia. CT findings are nonspecific, including segmental bowel wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding, often in the distribution of the “watershed” areas of the colon (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction). Colonoscopy is the primary method to diagnose colonic ischemia, usually after CT has shown a thickened segment of colon."
